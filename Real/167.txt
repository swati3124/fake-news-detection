clinton as watchdog and humorist a war of words between president clinton and senate minority leader bob dole of kansas has quickly escalated mr clinton launched the first verbal strike at a washington dinner over the weekend i do want to apologize to senator dole about one thing seriously we had this huge fight in the congress on this jobs program and the core of the republican attack in the senate was the community development block grant program which was really a republican idea that i like because it gave governors and mayors the chance to create jobs and for twelve years i used it to put our people to work and senator dole and all his republicans said you just dont understand this things full of pork its a dad gum scandal i was appalled and then i read yesterday in the wall street journal about a senator from kansas who asked for twenty three million dollars of that money to convert a senior citizen center to a boat house in kansas and he was right after all and i apologize to senator dole the president was referring to a letter from dole requesting a waiver from the government to turn a former senior citizen center into a privately run boat house the letter was asking for permission to the vacant building and use it as a bath house not money dole responded today with a news release charging or rather calling the charges a twenty three dollar million and theres no way the white house can defend it he states the white house lied and finishes with if the white house wants to play hard ball im ready to suit up president clintons draft record has prompted

washington ritual thats supposed to foster good will between the white house and the news media through humor and rubbing after hours president clinton used lots of one liners saturday night at the white house correspondents dinner heres a sample of the president poking fun at himself and his administration ive been wondering about these grades on a hundred days you cant imagine how disappointed i am by this whole grade thing because my mother still keeps all those report cards on her refrigerator i knew youd give hillary higher marks than me its just like law school all over again i am not doing so bad i mean at this point in his administration william henry harrison had been dead for sixty eight days ive kept all my major campaign promises i said id make my white house staff twenty five percent smaller i mean compare marlin fitzwater and george stephanopoulos theres a lot of heartbreak associated with this job when i first took this job i dreamed that in a hundred days id pick up a newspaper and read about a populist president whod broken the gridlock and gotten popular approval for a dramatic economic program and enjoyed the support of his people and i did and i resent the hell out of boris yeltsin ive got a lot to learn you know i was so worried about hillary and i bringing our daughter to washington and all the influences that might affect her just since shes been here shes told me she no longer believes in the easter bunny or santa claus or even the tooth fairy i was afraid it was that new school she was going to and so i had this serious talk with her i said did you learn all this at your school and she said no i just had a long talk with leon panetta look at old leon you know leons a good catholic he just cant keep it straight when hes supposed to go to confession thats all for this edition of inside politics im bernard shaw
