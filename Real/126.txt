as we mentioned even though the president is doing everything he can to fix and to focus attention on the economy his search for an attorney general still dominates the headlines from the white house c n ns wolf blitzer on the day that president clinton tried to get his domestic economic agenda back on track he was asked whether women are being subjected to a double standard in his cabinet selection process absolutely not for one thing this issue was never an issue it never occurred to anyone to make it an issue until zoe baird voluntarily disclosed it so no one knew so no one was subjected to a double standard still feeling the political heat from his failure to find a new attorney general hes asked two of his campaign veterans political consultants james carvel and paul begala to assist him in public relations damage control well im just going to try to help out with some political things for a short time i mean i dont think its anything very formal or official or very long term after withdrawing the nomination of zoe baird as attorney general a the expected nomination of new york federal judge kimba wood both because they had hired illegal aliens to work in their homes the president is promising it wont happen again i think everybody will do what theyre supposed to do you can be certain that the law will be complied with in all instances on sunday commerce secretary ron brown confirmed he too paid back taxes for domestic help insisting he was unaware of the initial obligation this was an issue that weve all became to after the zoe baird case theres a law that i think a lot of people were not aware of all the implications of the law relating to social security taxes prior to the zoe baird case but now we are aware of it and cabinet officials are expected to comply throughout the washington bureaucracy senior officials are now being asked whether they have a so called zoe baird problem i dont think ive every hired any domestic help to be honest with you i certainly i dont think i ever have never had to frankly and ive always done my own you can come to my house and see like all other appointees secretary christopher was asked to the best of his knowledge had he violated any law with the exception of traffic tickets i gather was the way the question was put his answer to that was number as far as finding a new attorney general is concerned president clintons aides are saying hes still looking but they expect an announcement very soon frank wolf some people are suggesting that the next thing were going to be looking for is whether people have gotten dog licenses just to make their pets legal some suggest this is getting out of hand how is president clinton and the others in the white house how are they dealing with this and what its the impact its having on their message well theyre clearly very frustrated by all of this and there is a sense that a lot of these technical violations are being blown out of all proportion indeed george stephanopoulos at a briefing earlier today suggested that this regulation that if someone has paid fifty dollars or more during a quarter or three months period that the employer has to withhold social security taxes that that was a law that was passed in the fifties and its time to take another look at that regulation meanwhile serious business is going at least in detail over at justice whats slipping through the cracks and whats the word on when an attorney general may be nominated well theres no general and a lot of decisions that have to be made is in terms of filing appeals for various cases and moving forward on the daily matters of the justice department theyre simply not being made pending an attorney general and theres not going to be a number two or a number three until theres a number one so theres a lot of pressure on the white house to come forward they want this over with as quickly as possible because as long as theres no attorney general these kinds of peripheral matters these kinds of problems are going to be hanging over the white house and they want to move on with the domestic economic issues in a word still looking for a woman theyre still looking for a woman now perhaps more than ever because of all of these allegations that theres a double standard and women are being penalized as opposed to men
