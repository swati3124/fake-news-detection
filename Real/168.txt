president clinton says the latest numbers are further proof that the country needs his plan for reducing the deficit he also acknowledged that he and his staff need to refocus their attention on what is important as the president put it to get our priorities straight heres a b cs brit hume in the oval office today the president acknowledged hes contemplating some changes in the white house staff as he prepares a major push to get his economic program through congress he conceded some of that laser focus on the economy he promised has been lost one thing that you risk when you try to get a lot of things going in a hurry is that you wind up having people work very very hard but maybe getting a little out of focus and i think we should bring it tighten the focus a little bit i think thats what we ought to do on capitol hill there were clear signs that the clinton programs momentum which once seemed unstoppable has faded just as the large tax increases hes proposed are being taken up i dont know what provisions in this tax bill we would get a majority for but we are instructed to raise two hundred seventy two billion dollars by june eighteenth if moynihan is worried the white house should be too because the democrats on his committee have only an eleven to nine majority meaning one switched vote could block the program the assessment was a bit more positive on the house side but even there the committee chairman was making no promises theres no question about it that the task before us is enormous but im firmly committed to helping president clinton achieve his basic plan and reach his deficit reduction targets republicans were making clear today they will resist i genuinely believe that the deficit is high because we spend too much not because we tax the american workers too little the republicans havent gotten much mileage out of that issue since george bush broke his no new taxes promises three years ago but now with mr clinton having proposed even bigger new taxes the republicans hope at least theyve go the tax issue back
