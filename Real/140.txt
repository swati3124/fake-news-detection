welcome back on income tax day two senior clinton officials suggested the way to finance health care might be a national sales tax the vat or value added tax but other top administration officials downplayed the likelihood of a vat i think someone was candid and said thats one of the many options that is being considered are the working groups have they examined the possibility of a vat yes they have has it been presented to the president has he made a decision no he has not reaction on capitol hill was not enthusiastic when you talk about value added or sales taxes youre hurting the poor people and that i think is what democrats are more concerned with than anything else at the same time the presidents proposed compromise of his economic stimulus was rejected by the senate republican leader it couldnt be worse timing were trying to the president trying to tell everybody we need this stimulus package and then somebody drops a new tax idea out there thats got to scare a lot of taxpayers who are already frightened because of the other big tax package mark why is bill clinton floating a value added tax right now al entertainment i dont know i dont know why hes doing it sure theres a couple of obvious reasons one you turn it on its a spigot full of money it just produces a great amount of money one hundred seven billion dollars one estimate the congressional budget office came up with even if you exempted food and other necessities youre talking about half fifty billion dollars just about the price at least a good part of the price you need for a national health plan al danny rostenkowski the chairman of the ways and means committee is absolutely right its a tax that hits not on a fair basis it hits the bottom the poorest fifth of americans its going to take five point four percent of their income the top fifth sitting over here to my immediate right it would take less than one percent of his income i think for any tax to work especially if its a democratic tax its such a major change there has to be a sense of fairness and thats missing i think you were talking about your far right mr novak my far right excuse me bob i would think if marks right i would think you would love this tax you love taxes for the poor rather than wealthy people it is and also if it will replace capital gains taxes and corporate taxes would you like it its a terrible tax and its not going to replace the income tax and corporate gain tax we have an eminent member of the ways and means committee its not going to happen the trouble with the people in the national association of manufacturers is theyre unrealistic they think this is going to get them off the hook from paying taxes and its not the big industrial american industries also think that its going to be a help for exports it isnt what its really going to do its going if it came in it would really hurt entrepreneurial development it isnt so bad on poor people as it is for people trying to make a living because with an entrepreneurial firm because every stage of the process of a product now gets taxed this is just a terrible idea and it was donna shalala who doesnt know anything about washington alice rivlin the deputy director of the bureau of the budget bureau who should know something about washington they just see all those greenbacks and got sandy i think it was like when they floated the cola you know were going to clamp down on colas during the budget process i think it was put out there so what they do come up with what they actually do come up with will look more reasonable im not sure it was a deliberate trial balloon a few members of the administration said they thought it was being considered its one of numerous options heres the dilemma in a word the clintons are leading an effort for health reform we need it in this country we need it badly we have thirty seven million uninsured in order to contain costs in an effective way its better to get everybody in but if you have cost containment its not going to work quickly enough so you recapture from the savings enough to spread insurance to all the uninsured so you have to look for additional resources that in my own view i think this proposal will not survive al gore said he didnt think it would happen i think theres not only a question of fairness theres the question of whether you can add a very substantial additional tax at this point even for as good a cause as health care and i think the answer is you cant do it the emphasis is going to have to be on cost containment so to paraphrase mark thats dead thats right mona bob dole rejected the stimulus thing bill clinton is up in pennsylvania trying to put pressure on people like arlen specter will that pressure work on any of those moderate republicans for his economic package no no i dont think so i think that bill clinton has succeeded in uniting the republicans to a remarkable extent and reminding them of what it is that they oppose bill clinton by proposing this vat at least floating it has shown that he believes the trouble with america is that americans have too much money in their pockets and that the government needs to take more of it in the form of b t u taxes income taxes and now even sales taxes which is what a vat is a national sales tax they are by a large degree the amount of patience the american people have with this and it could be a political killer its not the presidents proposal two people said its being considered by a five hundred person task force well hes backing away from it now right he didnt propose it sandy ill give you that no doubt of that but boy the last week or two this guy bill clinton who was magical just three weeks ago looks like hes kind of bumbling looks like hes kind of bumbling in the stimulus package this whole thing hasnt been handled right is the magic gone i dont think the magic is gone i think its hard work to get things done in this country people wanted change my guess is there will be a stimulus package i think people realize we need to stimulate jobs in this country and we need to try to do it right away right away ill tell you what the problem sandy is with your president and thats why hes hes yours too the trouble with al doesnt understand what it is but ill tell you what the problem is he really believes that all the growth that you need in this country can be generated by the government you can do it by spending by putting these silly make work programs out there and to do that you have to tax and tax and tax and tax the stimulus package goes to the private sector like construction jobs lets let the private sector which dont come on line for two years the criticism mark i dont think thats accurate but no it isnt accurate but whats happened to this guy is whats happened to clintons laser beam approach to the economy its gotten distracted its been off there was a beam in his eye i dont know lets get this straight al lets get this straight from brother novak i mean the criticism of bill clinton during the campaign was he was too close to the big business interests did i say that did i ever say that when did you ever in arkansas the chicken hear me say that pro business democrat lets say one thing he gets back on message and he better do it in a hurry hell prevail
