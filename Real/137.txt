from the world beneath the sea humans constantly are discovering ways to better all our lives one of the latest could lead to some earth friendly technology c n n science correspondent miles obrien has more on this pearl of a material part of this extracted from oyster shells is a protein called it helps survive by controlling how their shells grow and now a synthetic version of the same protein may help people protect the environment scientists at university have figured out how to make the protein in the laboratory theyre hoping it may soon be used in products ranging from to disposable diapers as an alternative to some of the non chemicals now in use and they are used in enormous quantities were talking about hundreds of millions of pounds of these being used the chemicals called are used to prevent particles in water from clumping together in the case of they keep dirt from sticking together in the wash water and getting back onto clean clothes or dishes theyre also used in boilers and cooling towers to keep mineral scale from building up and blocking pipes and theyre used in the super materials that soak up liquid in disposable diapers research started with the oyster protein because of the way it helps control development of the shell he figured it might also be able to control mineral build up in other situations and because its a protein he knew it would be the question was where to get enough of the protein to experiment with we immediately recognized that one couldnt use either natural systems to make enough protein or we couldnt extract enough protein for heavens sake from or anything else for the kind of applications were talking about so they had to learn exactly what was in the protein and then come up with a way to make it in the lab wheeler says the process could easily be scaled up for use in industry a form of the chemical that would work in detergents is almost ready for market were talking really about only months to less than a year before that could happen but wheeler points out its up to manufacturers whether they switch to the chemicals because theres no law requiring them to choose it developing a form of for use in disposable diapers is further down the road but it holds the potential for making tons of landfill garbage more
