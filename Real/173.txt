president clinton is offering federal help to families and businesses left by the swollen mississippi and national guard troops are now at work in the fight to help contain the raging waters it is the worst flooding in three decades along the river as shelters fill with evacuees farmland just keeps filling with more water and agriculture experts predict huge crop losses c n ns jeff flock has more on the mess facing residents of the midwest jeff well bobbie natalie it is indeed a mess here in hannibal missouri at least here along south main street we perhaps can see some of the water damage already weve got over here i dont know bruce if you can see that thats the american red cross whos now feeding some of the folks that have decided to stay and weather it out you can see this house this is mr raymond who we talked to a little bit earlier today who has decided to stay on the second floor of his home i think you can quite clearly see that the first floor is pretty much and he has decided to stay he and his wife and his cat are upstairs there and they are getting provisions because obviously their power is out and they really have no other means of eating so that is the situation along here lets take a spin on down south main street this is this is not normally something you can see from a boat the mississippi river is quite a ways on out come on over here were trying to talk to some of the folks who live in and around this area and i want to talk to a few of them now what goes through your mind as you see all of this water where it shouldnt be oh i think that the flood levees should have been run down they protected one part of the town left us open for this our viewers should know that there is a flood levee that is protecting much of hannibal but this area is not yes if they would just get us something down in here to where we dont have to go through this all the time you know i can stress the fact that were all in jeopardy i mean we all need help down here cause youre concerned about the water rising even more yeah yeah absolutely and if that happens your house is right on the edge is that right yes its only a few inches of comin through my downstairs floors now and at the new crest itll get it yeah theres not really a whole lot i can do about it except wait until its over and see whats wrong i understand we brought a few of the younger ones out here i know some of you folks that have lived along the river for a long time know what a river town is like and have dealt with floods before burt walker is a fellow who has probably seen his this is your first flood yes what do you make of it well i think if they would just build a levee like down to the this water wouldnt be here right now you think they should have built the levee bigger yeah i mean it wouldnt have to be a big old steel plate all the way down there i think it should just be a little levee like goes all the way down for the water wouldnt be right here today of course that costs a lot of money you know yeah but well theyre just that mark twain down there they dont want no water down there so we shouldnt have to have water up here well that makes some since okay burt hey justin how bout you heres another fellow who hasnt seen any big floods before what do you think of all this water i think its just terrible i think are you worried its going to come into your house im very very worried how close is it to your house its pretty close thats all i can say okay justin i appreciate it very much thank you maybe you can see some of the businesses here along south main businesses homes theres a grain elevator on down the river and this is now according to the coast guard this is officially mississippi river so they have controlled traffic on it obviously no barge traffic in this area one man one captain who is out along it though is jack livingston who has been ferrying us around all day and we appreciate that jack youve got a house that buts right up against the mississippi river right now not youre normally a quarter mile from the river but what do you make of it well its a lot of water comin in and we dont know how much were going to get but theres supposed to be more water comin up you know and its going to raise the sixth or seventh of july you know so in other words thats what theyre telling you about the crest is that tomorrow or the next day well the sixth or seventh you know so i dont know how much is coming theyve got a lot of water in iowa and everything so its going to be a month or so before we ever you know get out of here and this and that and the waters you know we got to put up with it there aint much we can do about it you know you had a big flood in nineteen seventy three twenty years ago now and the water was up quickly but down quickly this what youre saying is based on what theyre telling you this water will be here for a while yeah its going to be here for a while not good news to you no no its not i want to bring you back one second these homes that were showing over here right now i believe we are these are some of your relatives here yes my uncle has the corner house and his daughter has the house next to it theyve all been run from their homes in the early morning hours last thursday theyve lost all their belongings my uncle is disabled you know they dont have nothing
