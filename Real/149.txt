ross perot claims the north american free trade agreement is similar to shooting yourself in the foot perot arguing his case against nafta before the senate banking committee today he says it will mean jobs will move to mexico a claim nafta supporters dispute perot also called it economic treason for an american to lobby on behalf of the interests of other countries the iowa supreme court says theres a balancing of rights at a political rally and a tipped the balance when he denied former president bush the chance to speak at a nineteen ninety fundraiser charles and others voiced their opposition to united states involvement in kuwait appealed his conduct conviction saying his constitutional right to free speech was violated the iowa state supreme court ruled president bush possessed the same right and denied it the conviction stands many americans consider it their right to poke fun at their political system what would editorial cartoonists draw or humorists talk about if not for politics well in russia politics hasnt always been a laughing matter but thats changing as c n ns claire shipman reports russians have always enjoyed a good chuckle at the expense of their leaders boris yeltsin included of course a few years ago making fun of the kremlin boss wouldnt have had funny results oh there were plenty of jokes about the old guys all right but told on the sly these days with political theatrics in high gear its open season on all politicians in march there was a kremlin meeting this young comic sang not to decide which branch has power but from which branch they all should hang for the last half decade political humor has been on the rise but some think it may be losing its appeal it was interesting then because it was forbidden fruit says the director of this theater company now were moving away from it toward everyday humor take this little about high prices and the search for an affordable pay toilet theres nothing else we can do but laugh he says but politics arent worth laughing at olga for one though still enjoys a good joke about antics at the top it seems to me our congress is a lot like a circus she says but less talented hmm maybe so the pen of course can prove equally cutting magazine openly all the big shots in decades past it towed a careful political line drawing laughs from scenes of everyday life vladimir says people may be tired of politics but try as they might they cant escape from high prices and spiraling inflation the subject of this cartoon its all politics at root and of course the man who made all this public fun poking possible had himself included hes still good for a laugh now and then so if the ailment is russian politics laughter may not be the cure but it certainly helps to ease the pain claire shipman c n n moscow thats all for this edition of inside politics im bernard shaw
