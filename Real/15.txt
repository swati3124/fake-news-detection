the americas cup races continue in san diego today and all eyes seem to be on italys entry c n ns charles jaco tells us about the excitement that the italian challenger is creating the first italian challenger in the one hundred forty one year history of the americas cup is the venice named for shakespeares who committed suicide italian fans hope that is not an omen its very very exciting for us and were all rooting for the boat and we believe its a wonderful boat the italians were a joke in world class racing until recently but no one laughs now none of this came cheap to the italians or any of the other entries ask the kansas millionaire who owns the u s boat named america a fully outfitted boat costs five million dollars and in order to be competitive in the americas cup youve got to have at least two boats and up to four or five boats land locked spectators may drink beer but the racing is strictly for the champagne crowd all the syndicates who originally competed for this years cup spent over one half of a dollar billion dollars the americas cup is a test of sportsmanship but its also a test of technology and a test of how much money you have for example the america syndicate even hired an electronic surveillance boat to keep eyes and ears on the italian entry during its preliminary runs which helps illustrate the fact that the u s and italian groups do not like one another of course we have some psychological battle that is part of the game its like two different political parties trying to run for the presidency theres just something that is kind of you know an ongoing thing thats kind of come along through the years mutual respect and maybe mutual dislike at the same time absolutely if the u s entry wins this best of seven race series the nineteen ninety five races are in san diego and if the italians win these mega expensive crafts compete next off venice
