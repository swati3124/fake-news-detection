anthony died yesterday at age ninety two perhaps the name doesnt ring a bell but mr born in sicily worked there as a trolley car conductor served in the italian infantry in world war one sailed to america in nineteen twenty one found work as a helper saved up bought a taxi cab then a grocery on long island and what might have been just another immigrant success story went big time after anthony moved to florida in the nineteen forties he bought the cafeteria in and developed a spectacularly lucrative relationship with oranges ken is a former president and chairman of the company that mr founded mr perhaps you can begin by telling us what was it about orange juice and oranges that anthony did that other people didnt do well i think you have to understand the timing at the time he got into to the business orange juice was then primarily made from concentrate and he felt that there might be a better product that could be achieved and so he kept working on equipment that was available at that time to develop something that might be just superior to concentrate or concentrate which you might buy in a frozen section of your grocery store and when he couldnt find equipment he in fact designed it and built it critical to his success i gather was the use of the refrigerated truck primarily because at that time refrigeration in the stores was limited and distribution in refrigerated food was almost unknown and so he at that time sat down with very little funds and bought i think one hundred fifty refrigerated trucks from the white motor company in the early nineteen fifties was the idea of was that challenging the more popular concentrate that was already on the market yes it was a competitive battle to convince the industry that the product was practical and then to convince the consumer that the product was better is the orange juice that people buy on the shelves now the company has gone through a couple of changes of ownership since obviously but is it the same brew of orange juice that mr used to test every morning i gather during his days at oh i think so i think its exactly the same product and probably somewhat a little more sophisticated due to technology which has occurred since he sold the company ive read that in nineteen forty seven he developed a huge contract with the waldorf astoria that was fruit salad segments this was a business that he literally put together he at first had a fresh fruit company and in shipping the fresh fruit he had to you know you have to that out to grade it out and he had a lot of fruit that was not but was still good fruit and he was not one to waste things and so he started that fruit and putting it into gallon jars and he ultimately built quite a market with the hotel and restaurant trade starting in new york city where he was familiar with the trade and it became an industry all of its own are you saying that when he did that he was making use of fruit that might not have been looked good enough to ship whole up to new york is that it that is correct in other words it wouldnt meet the fresh fruit grade but was altogether good fruit so he simply took the peel off and cut the sections out and put it into jars and capped it under vacuum and shipped it up there so this was a man who when he looked at fruit in a business proposition he really saw the potential what was inside the fruit what you could make from the orange or the grapefruit apart from simply selling it as an orange or a grapefruit i think thats correct i think he looked at people the same way he looked inside and he saw something there a lot of times other people wouldnt see ken former president and chairman of speaking to us from florida about founder anthony mr was also a philanthropist after selling his company to beatrice foods for nearly five hundred million dollars in nineteen seventy eight he donated much of that money to establish two christian foundations
