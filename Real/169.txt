and welcome to c n n world report were going to bring you the news as reported by the worlds broadcasters from their perspective im ralph as we mentioned a moment ago the fourth annual c n n world report conference is underway in atlanta some two hundred contributors from more than one hundred countries are gathered to confer on the evolving role of the media around the world as in years past on world report were turning to some of the participants of the conference to share their knowledge about their regions first today well be joined by nora of n b c namibia for some insight on africa first however a quick look at some of this years developments on that often troubled continent in somalia today u s troops turned over control of famine relief to united nations forces the u s led operation may have saved millions of lives but somalias troubles are far from over the famine in neighboring sudan has been described as perhaps that of somalias and efforts to feed the starving are largely being blocked by the muslim fundamentalist government and by other parties to the countrys civil war on the other side of the continent the toughest trouble spot remains liberia where a vicious civil war continues despite the presence of a western african peace keeping force on the positive side theres some reason for hope in nigeria where democratic elections are planned for next month and military rule seems likely to end last december kenya reached a milestone of sorts by holding its first multi party elections the results of which were widely disputed in the meantime in southern africa two long term sores continue to fester the eighteen year civil war in angola goes on despite last years signing of a peace treaty and in south africa efforts to end apartheid are hampered by black factional violence and by continued resistance to majority rule from some powerful white groups joining us for some more insight into africa nora of n b c namibia the problem of sudan it is almost like a mirror of what we have seen happen for so long in somalia is it is the same thing happening there its been a longer conflict for a first start and i think the problems are different in the sudanese conflict i think the sudanese conflict is basically one of the northern half of the country being developing at the expense of the southern half of the country that of course for various reasons has been and is now made out to be a racial conflict between blacks and the arabs when in fact it isnt its basically a problem of but we there were wire reports this afternoon showing that thousands of lives are at stake over there right now and the food apparently is being sent but just not getting to the people who need it yes unfortunately that is the case in sudan who the companies who do we blame who is to blame in the sudanese conflict who is to blame for the fact that food doesnt get to the people who most need it both sides are to blame its neither the fault of the sudanese rebels and neither is the government to blame both sides i think are to blame and to a large extent the world as well for not having taken a certain responsibility towards sudan the world has most part just set back and not taken active steps in solving the sudanese conflict liberia we thought for a while that maybe things were going to work out for the better there and there are still troubles in that country there again i think the world has left the africans to solve the liberian conflict by and large the africans have been left to solve it as we see with the intervention are you saying that theyre not capable of solving the problem without some outside help well have they solved it no they havent which means that perhaps another solution has to be found and maybe an outside intervention the united nations intervention american intervention to keep the peace what about angola yes one of my pet topics in angola i would blame the united states they are directly responsible in my opinion for that conflict for a very long time for a number of years they helped and they supported savimbi when he re when he restarted the war after he lost the elections i think the onus was on the united states to put pressure on savimbi and to bring him in line and that they were not able to do and what happened he got so much power that now it is too late to do anything about it number it isnt too late to do anything about it i think that the united states if the united states really had firm commitment toward peace in angola they would have moved in and they would have neutralized savimbi and they havent done so so what is the answer as we look at it today youve said the united states in the past was the problem well what do we do now well i think for a start giving the angolan government the legitimate angolan government which came to power as we all know through the ballot box i think recognizing the angolan government and giving it the kind of assistance that it needs and is asking for would be a step in the right direction all right
