you know being in the middle of nowhere doesnt necessarily mean being without electricity in tonights science report c n ns miles obrien sheds new light on solar power for most of us it is second nature walk into a darkened room and flip on the light switch in november this remote research outpost in the middle of californias desert was the first to receive solar power in a box two large shipping boxes to be exact the portable solar power station inside was installed in only two days what a difference two days can make its been like a change from night to day i mean it gives us one heck of a lot of flexibility which we did not have before now researchers at the california state university facility have more than enough power they can work cook and read whenever they like and a noisy polluting diesel generator no longer runs a lot of people are disturbed when they have to come here and listen to you know diesel generators running all the time the nearest electrical lines from here are five and a half miles away according to a southern california edison estimate it would cost about seven hundred fifty thousand dollars just to bring power in here much more than cal state would like to spend and not to mention the potential environmental damage caused by digging trenches in this environmentally sensitive area on a great day like today itd probably produce about ten thousand watts edison researcher nick engineered this solar solution the panels fit in one shipping container batteries which store a five day reservoir of power and a backup propane generator fit in the other we opened up the doors pulled everything out and much like an set just hung everything on the container this portability greatly reduces the cost of solar power right now edison is trying to prove its a reliable viable system for anyone who isnt plugged into the power grid and so the whole package ends up costing relatively more than what you would pay for if you were in the los angeles basin but then again its a lot cheaper than having to generate it yourself or to be without energy entirely they wont have to convince cal state desert researchers simple pleasures are not taken for granted here
