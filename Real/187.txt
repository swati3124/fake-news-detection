on the popular daytime soap another world linda plays romance novelist felicia gallant recently though left the soap to co star in an episode of perry mason the soap writers wanted to keep the emmy winning presence in the show until her return well what to do for the july fourteenth episode will play the role of felicia gallant senior entertainment correspondent bill tush explains only in the world of soap operas could writers come up with a plot twist to temporarily replace one its stars so easily just put out the word that a linda look alike is needed enter a new york attorney who has been told more than once that she looks like the actress i do look like her according to a lot of people so it was a natural thing for me to try out i had a lot of fun with it it wasnt something that i ordinarily would do but it paid off beat out the other clones to win the role and even had the chance to meet the lady herself i asked her if it was fun to come into a room of people who look like her or if it was strange and she thought it was fun and i asked her how it felt to look like me and heres doing her best to look and act like so maybe you saw her shes a very woman with your taste in actually mine was the only hat on board except for that strange man with the i think hes following me hey those years in the courtroom came in handy when one is in court as a litigator one can be theatrical in front of a jury and i suppose there are some similarities could it be the show biz bug has bitten the litigator i suppose it would be nice to do it again im not necessarily sitting by the phone but if i had an opportunity id certainly answer it by the way in that perry mason episode linda is not playing a lawyer
