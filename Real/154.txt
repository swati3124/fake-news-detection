the national rifle association is under fire at its meeting this week in nashville tennessee n r a membership is at an all time high but so are questions concerning its historic opposition to gun control in the wake of recent violence near waco texas yet visit a firing range and youre likely to find more people learning to shoot many are women is this a new trend or a new profit center for gun makers a look from c n ns loretta fear is driving many women to the firing line fear of assault youre at some place dark and somebody is walking towards you and you know it could happen so quickly and pro gun lobbies are helping women deal with their fears by offering them information on self protection but gun control advocates accuse the firearms industry of merely marketing fear to women i dont want to use it but if anybody threatened me or my family i dont think id hesitate and for many that means packing protection thats easy to reach if you feel like youre in danger just pull it right out enrollment figures confirm women are stepping up to the firing line for instruction but theres little concrete evidence to support the perception that more women are buying guns and of the women who have purchased firearms most say its for protection there again perception and reality may not mix the national rifle association says roughly seventeen million women own guns and the number is growing but one independent study shows female handgun ownership over the past decade has remained fairly constant but many women dont purchase their own guns or admit owning them at all my husband got into it for a hobby more or less and then decided that he was traveling a lot and it was probably a good idea that i had a gun at home and im sometimes out in the middle of the night in my car i work in my car while carjackings have grabbed recent headlines government statistics indicate the violent crime rate against women has declined since nineteen eighty two they pull their gun out and theyre not sure what to do and the gun gets taken away from them so thats quite thats why law enforcement recommends women learn how to properly handle their guns im not going to make anybody annie oakley in three days the biggest thing that i try to do more than anything in the world is give them the confidence in their ability to use the gun if they have to i have a lot of respect for a gun because its very powerful but i feel like i can handle it now
