new chairman seeks inclusive g o p im rowland evans robert novak and i will question the newly elected chairman of the republican national committee he is haley barbour of city mississippi barbour was elected chairman friday on the third ballot by the republican national committee age forty five barbour was political director at the white house under president reagan and since then has been a washington lobbyist he is republican national from mississippi and was described this way in his nominating speech one of our own who understands the republican party from the ground up from the bottom to the top from the precincts to the white house he is one of us before barbour was elected departing national chairman rich bond challenged whoever succeeded him to take the abortion issue out of politics are we willing to stake our partys fortunes on a single issue is it the job of the republican party to lead the crusade mr barbour this is your first television interview since your election congratulations thank you bob are you ready to follow the advice by your predecessor rich bond and actively move to eliminate any mention of abortion from the platform of the party in nineteen ninety six you know rich was chairman for a year and made his views known yesterday and im sure hes got a good strong basis of that but were not going to do anything about our platform until nineteen ninety six we dont have a chance to do that ive said throughout this campaign that my own view is that we cannot let abortion or any other issue be a litmus test if we let abortion be the threshold issue of republicanism we need our heads examined i understand that position but do you have an opinion on whether there should be any mention of abortion in the platform i mean mr bond thinks it should be eliminated do you think it should be eliminated or not be eliminated i think the biggest problem we had in nineteen ninety two is that the white house imposed just stuffed down a position on abortion that was an position on the convention that we did not really have the convention decide what the abortion plank ought to be when nineteen ninety six comes around well see what the political facts about abortion are what is at issue you know at one time the only question was should abortion be legal or illegal but in the wake of the webster decision the mississippi decision the pennsylvania decision there are a lot more issues that are relevant today in terms of how much abortion should be limited regulated by the state and in nineteen ninety six i dont have a crystal ball to know what the issues will be i do know that right now we need to talk more about the issues that unite us as republicans and not let any one issue be a litmus test mr chairman i want to make one more try at that you said that the abortion issue should be submerged to its rightful place please define for me rightful place well that it not be a litmus test that we not have people believe that if they disagree with the republican platform position on abortion that somehow theyre second class republicans im pro life but there are millions and millions of good republicans who are pro choice who are every bit as good republicans as i you dont have to agree with haley barbour on everything to be a good republican and thats one thing that our chairman and our party has to stand for were the conservative party in this country but we are a broad mainstream party and were a diverse party in a party big enough to elect a president of the united states everybodys not going to agree on everything do you think we shouldnt expect to do you think that your predecessor as i detected a note of criticism in what you said hed been chairman and suddenly on the way out he makes this statement do you think he made a mistake number i was not being you may have detected a note of criticism but it was not intended just rich has been chairman he has a right to his own opinions and to share with the committee what he thinks after his year as chairman of the r n c as i come in i have my own experiences which are different from but no hes got its like i was saying a minute ago we dont have to agree on everything were not supposed to agree on everything if everybody agreed with me itd be a mighty small party very very briefly and then i want to move to larger other issues was it a constructive thing statement for rich bond to have made at this particular moment yes or no i think rich was expressing himself about a real concern all right that does truly exist in the party and to the degree of putting it on the table theres nothing wrong with that i dont want to say it was not constructive its just his giving his opinion all right mr chairman i was present in saint louis for the last two days just got back to washington and i found a lot of your supporters were very much afraid of the fact that phyllis schlafly and the right and the pro life people were supporting your principal opponent spencer abraham the former michigan chairman for chairman is the kiss is the endorsement of phyllis schlafly now a negative in the party oh i dont know about that i dont know that phyllis schlafly took any role in the thing until right at the very last so i dont know i think the reason that i won was that i appealed to a broad diverse group in the party geographically philosophically we were all generally conservatives who were running but i think people felt comfortable with me they wanted a chairman who could be both an effective spokesman to articulate our message and a nuts and bolts organizational leader like we had when ray bliss was chairman and i think people voted for me because they thought i could do that and not because they were trying to vote against somebody else these were all good candidates good people who have a lot to contribute are you uncomfortable with the role of the christian coalition in the party the role of conservative activists does that bother you do you think it is a problem for the future of the republican party you know i come from the bible belt i come from mississippi thats where i live as you said i live in city mississippi conservative christians are very active in our party down there theyre a big part of our base theyre an asset to our party i think the same is true all over the country people do get concerned whether its the christian coalition or any other group if there is an impression that somebody is trying to take over the party to exclude people we dont need takeovers or purges but i dont want to exclude anybody the christian coalition or conservative christians or whatever you want to call the group that is a big asset to our party they need to be welcome under our big tent they are welcome under our big tent and they do a lot for us mr chairman you were supported by the most liberal elements in the republican national committee who are not all that element but the who are not all that liberal but they were there what commitments did you make to have people like of pennsylvania support you what promise did you make them that you who has a reputation deserved or not as a conservative to get that kind of support well of course i am a conservative bob and i think and a lot of other people who dont agree with me on every issue supported me because they felt comfortable with me that im an that i recognize that our partys a coalition that it is a broad mainstream party its generally a conservative party and that i reach out to the people that dont agree with me on everything and i have always gotten along on the committee and shes always treated me fairly and ive always treated her fairly when i was at the white house with president reagan republicans all across the spectrum found that i knew my job was to try to help them get elected to make our party stronger and to make ronald reagan stronger and i think that experience with me is what led people who are maybe not as conservative as i to vote for me mr chairman i want to try to get from you what you consider your toughest problem in putting back or creating a party that can win elections in nineteen ninety four and nineteen ninety six im going to do it this way you have said the republican party must return to its principles implying that under bush it lost its principles one of your major figures in the party pat buchanan has said that the g o p base today is rock solid now explain that contradiction or conflict and where you want to take the party well you know i dont know that there exactly what pat said or whether that is a contradiction i believe this is the case that the people who voted for us in nineteen eighty and eighty four and eighty eight didnt change their minds after the nineteen eighty eight election about the conservative views they had about government it was by nineteen ninety two they werent sure that we still believed in what theyd voted for in eighty and eighty four and eighty eight and i think what we have to do is we have to demonstrate to the american people and project our principles so that we regain our position in this country as a party of principle and a party of ideas and i think we lost that during between eighty eight and ninety two i cant say that it was because maybe wed been in office too long maybe we didnt have fresh ideas maybe the democratic congress did everything they could do to thwart george bush maybe all of those things are true nothing i can do about that and finger pointing doesnt make doesnt do anybody any good but i do know this people need to know over the next two to and four years what we republicans stand for what we believe in and we need to emphasize the principles that unite us so that people in nineteen ninety four when we have these elections are like they were in nineteen eighty four and say well i know what a republican is i know what they want to do i know where they want to take the government thats the biggest challenge weve got mr chairman the question of gay rights is a very hot one today in washington in the military and in this country its probably the top social issue going right now pat buchanan again to quote him after saying that the party base is rock solid he says that gay rights are anti biblical and amoral do you agree with that well i didnt hear exactly what pat said because thats what he said ive been out here ive been trying to anti biblical and amoral get eighty three votes i think that in a piece in the wall street journal i think most americans absolutely recognize that this is not should not be foisted on the american people as an acceptable alternative lifestyle that its like being or something and i think if that the republican party has to stand for the proposition that were not going to let bill clinton go out and make a payoff to a special interest group without any consideration for national security without any consideration for the effectiveness or order in the military in the face of the advice the experienced advice yeah of the joint chiefs of staff i think the republican partys going to support the joint chiefs of staffs position i respect it and i think its right so mr chairman youre saying this has become a major issue between the parties or at least between the republican party and the clinton white house and this is going to be this is going to continue to be one of the great social issues going into the next two years as you try to reform the republican party is that correct i would say this has become a great issue between the american people versus the clinton white house now what its duration will be and how i would describe it as great and all these other things i just dont tend to characterize things that way but i think right now the american people think that the position president clintons taken is not the right position that its out of step with what ought to be done that its bad for the military and theyre opposed to it and i think republicans are as usual in tune with the thinking of the average american mr barbour are you afraid of your party being called the party of intolerance because i know a lot of your colleagues and some members of the national committee are i am afraid of any time our party appears to be intolerant of diversity were a diverse party if you so you could get in trouble im not afraid of the names people call me you can call me anything you want to what i am afraid of is if the american people get the impression that were not an inclusive party so this gay we have to make this gay issue could be a dangerous issue for you then well if you stand for your principles and make sure that you dont come across as intolerant but that youre being for what is right and what you believe in then im not worried about it i think that you have to be for whats right but at the same time not beat people over the head with it that people who dont agree with me on an issue as long as theyre generally in tune with the republican position theyre fine ronald reagan used to say when i was at the white house a fellow who agrees with you eighty percent of the time is your friend and ally hes not some twenty percent traitor and i think we as a as party leaders we have to think like that im not trying to be the head of a special interest group im going to be the chairman of a political party and its diverse mr chairman one of your opponents a member of the national committee told me on friday that you were you probably the edge that gave you the victory was probably the support by the political consultants who are afraid that under abraham they would be cut off the payroll what is your policy going to be on hiring political consultants at the republican national committee well my policy is that generally we will not hire political consultants were certainly going to do away with the idea that there can be in perpetuity where people were just hired on an open ended bases sometimes its not in the best interest of the party or any other business to hire staff and to pay for infrastructure to do a project that its cheaper more effective and more efficient to contract it out when we do that and we will do it sometime were not going to get in the polling business and were not going to get in the printing business or the production of materials business like brochures and that sort of stuff so and were going to contract that out and when we do were going to do it on a bid basis an basis were going to have fewer consultants but we will have some consultants because there are going to be certain things so that were just not going to spend the money to do ourselves so mr chairman you agree with bob dole who considers himself today the number one republican in the country and he may be correct that you should be a nuts and bolts chairman period and you shouldnt run around criticizing senators members of congress about their votes on bills and about their political positions am i right in that i think i said earlier in the show that i think the reason i got elected chairman is that committee members saw me as able to be both a nuts and bolts organizational leader and an effective spokesman for the party i think thats the chairmans job to do both i dont think the chairman of the r n c is the head of the shadow government the shadow would be the shadow prime minister well can i ask you this sir will you ever sure criticize a republican senator as dole says you should not well of course were going to do whats best in the best interest of the party sometimes legislative decisions may have to be made where the best legislative decision is to try to work out a compromise but that may not be what the republican party wants and im going to be talking about what the republican party wants you know one thing we learned in the bush administration president bush was hurt so many times by compromising with congress i guess sometimes it was necessary but politically compromising with this congress is like paying the to eat you last i didnt get the and thats not something im going to do very much i didnt get the answer on that that means you will criticize a republican sometime if its necessary i think we will criticize bad decisions by the government and sometimes republicans may be supporting that were not going to go out and pick out republicans to criticize but if the clinton administration does something that we think is bad policy even if some republicans support it thats not going to stop me from criticizing and talking about what the republicans are for mr chairman weve got we have to take a break we have to take a break for messages and when we come back it will be with the big question for the new republican national chairman mr chairman the big question the washington post this morning treated your election in a i thought a rather curious way the headline was lobbyist elected g o p national chairman will you tell us now that when your term ends probably in four years that you will not return to the lobbyist trade i dont know what ill do at the end of four years hopefully well have a republican president in the white house at the end of four years because thats my job to win elections in ninety three ninety four ninety five and ninety six but as you know on my election ill be selling having been elected ill be selling my interest in my law firm to my partners ill my relationship with it i wont have any ties to it business ties to it at all or financial ties so i dont know what ill be doing at the end of ninety six in other words you dont feel that the ethics rule that president clinton has put in for ron brown as secretary of commerce that he cannot lobby for four years after his office that doesnt apply to the chairman of the republican national committee of course ron brown when he was chairman of the democratic national committee practiced law the whole time he never stopped i thought that was inappropriate and thats why im not going to practice law as chairman of the r n c but should but it is different working but should the ethics than working for the federal government so you may go back to lobbying in other words i may i may go back to city to practice law i may i dont know what ill do hopefully well have a republican administration and maybe ill get a chance to participate in it just like bill brock did just quickly most of the last committee meeting was held behind closed doors secret ballots are you going to continue that closed door type of activity as national chairman well i think therell be both some closed and some open press stuff i think its good for the party when we talk strategy to talk personnel that sort of stuff that it be behind closed doors i think its only fair its stupid to telegraph to the democrats what were going to be doing mr chairman our to win elections and two seconds two seconds will you bring in congressional district representation on the national committee no sir o k were a federation of state parties thank you very and thank you very much haley barbour congratulations on your election my partner and i will be back with some comments after these messages bob i think we heard a war cry for the new chairman of the republican national committee gays in the military absolutely not he said were going to have to look at this issue very very carefully he said its a matter of clinton versus the republican party its clinton versus the whole country on this issue haley barbour the issue of abortion he the whole question of the christian coalition and the right wing of the republican party he certainly didnt want to follow the very contentious line taken by rich bond he wants to bring the party together he doesnt want to throw out ultimatums to the right wing but you know i was surprised bob he did not finesse my question about bob dole he indicated very strongly that as chairman he is going to take positions and he is going to carry his fight if necessary to the republican minority in the congress and assert the partys position i hope bob dole heard that mr barbour has been in politics all his life he is undoubtedly the most national chairman the republicans ever had as far as going on television goes and when youre on a when youre out of power that is a major asset for a national chairman im robert novak
