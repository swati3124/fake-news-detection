for mikhail gorbachev history came full circle today at a tiny missouri college known as the birthplace of the iron curtain c n ns jeff flock reports the former soviet leaders goal was to shed the remnants of the cold war and look to the future it was historical mikhail gorbachev with a post mortem on the cold war delivered from the same podium winston churchill forecast it from forty six years earlier he came to the same town toured the same campus ate the same lunch as churchill but while churchill warned of military aggression from in the baltic to in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent gorbachev warned against more basic problems but today global climatic shifts the greenhouse effect the ozone hole all threaten the stability for the planet like churchill gorbachevs address focused on the future if speech was the iron curtain speech then perhaps gorbachevs could be called the new civilization speech but while churchill hoped his view his forecast of a coming cold war was wrong gorbachev clearly hopes that his view of a new cooperative world order delivered here comes true he called for world controls on nuclear weapons regulation of nuclear power an end to all weapons exports and a focus on human rights as well as a dramatic reorganization of the united nations to administer it all bob guthrie was there to hear both churchill and gorbachev and is skeptical the world government idea a lot of people arent ready for it im not but im ready for cooperation and i know that weve got to bring along some people who havent been brought along so far others may take some time to digest it all it was impressing i just thought it was so interesting to be here and part for this historical event it was wonderful gorbachev himself summed up the similarities between post world war two nineteen forty six and the post cold war era forty six years later the goal today has not changed peace and progress for all but now we have the capacity to approach it without paying the heavy price weve been paying these past fifty years or so gorbachev says churchill and the west misjudged the threat of soviet aggression in nineteen forty six stalin he says was afraid of war with the west a lesson says gorbachev that the future must be built on cooperation not conflict
