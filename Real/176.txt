the summer in the u s is making life miserable throughout much of the eastern part of the country correspondent deborah potter has more from washington from the nations capitol up and down the east coast it was hard to find anyone who wasnt hot add in the humidity and youre talking misery the weather service calls it the heat index were trying to define with an apparent temperature if you will the temperature your body feels it is at mid day in washington the index hit one hundred seven high enough to be a health risk especially for the elderly it means stay inside preferably in an air conditioned space avoid any strenuous exercise outside and to drink plenty of fluid in new york some elderly residents took the advice and crowded into a senior center for some who had to work staying cool was almost impossible but at the midwest ice company in detroit the coolest place to be was on the job i was sweatin like a dog before i came in and you know we aint got nothin but fans at home so im glad to be up in here now im cool very cool while yall out there sweatin im in here out real nice outside the answer seemed to be water get near it or in it or get it in you ice cream today cause its everywhere so no one wants to buy it is there any relief in sight the maps say no weve had a stagnant weather situation theres very little air motion outside so the middle atlantic states and the eastern seaboard are in for a heat wave for at least the next week some at least arent by the forecast heat and cold affects the body but the soul is unaffected by these things so thats why we come out either way
