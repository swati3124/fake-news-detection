we go now to some pictures of chief daryl gates these are live come in and assist us here chief what about the national guard the national guard will be in their armories at the ready weve ordered up about two thousand of them and if we need them will they just do regular law enforcement or just patrol or what well so far we think we can handle it with just regular law enforcement thats what were going to attempt to do if we find that we cant do it then well of course bring in the national guard how will you assess how the situation is being controlled right now the officers seem to be coming in and out efficiently how would you assess their effectiveness now in controlling the situation well i think when we get em on the street any particular sector they do very well but the problem is we do not have enough out there if youve been out as i have you find many locations where there are no officers and that needs to be corrected and were trying to do that as quickly as we can weve just brought in two hundred fifty highway which will assist us in sealing off the area as you know well have a curfew in place very shortly and a ban on gun sales a ban on selling of gasoline except into an automobile tank and as we move forward i think well be able to get this thing under control but its going to take some time chief for the people of los angeles who were watching this morning what is your message to them what should the people of the city do well i hope the people who are not in this area stay out of this area and as a matter of fact theyre going to be kept out of this area the people within this area and i think most of them are staying within their homes and i think they should stay there and allow us to go out and take care of the hoodlums that are on the street that are looting and burning and well do that as quickly as we possibly can chief are you surprised at the restraint thats being shown apparently ive heard very little calls of officers using their weapons at all im not surprised our officers are far more disciplined than a lot of people give us credit for but there has been as you know some shooting this evening already we have a fireman that was seriously injured and at any rate were moving as quickly as we can we are totally mobilized in the department that means we are on twelve hour watches a and b watches and slowly but surly we will bring this under control are you targeting specific areas chief at this point to be secured first oh yes we have a whole plot plan of the entire south central los angeles area that is marked for coverage do you have a time table of how long this could take well my hope is that within the next several hours we will have enough people out there to slowly bring this under control how are your officers handling this situation with sort of an onslaught after the rodney king verdict how are they personally dealing with all of this well i dont think any of them are thinking about the rodney king trial theyre thinking about whats happening on the street right now and how they individually and as a group can deal with that problem on the street chief are you concerned with the way the violence has spread not just from south central los angeles weve had reports as far as venice some up in downtown los angeles and as far down as long beach the downtown area came about because we moved them out of parker center and then they moved into the downtown area and up into the civic center area we think thats pretty much under control now most of its in the south portion of los angeles and thats pretty wide spread if you look at the fires and the looting its pretty wide spread the mobility though youre talking about people in the westwood area youre talking about various areas around and outside of south central are the freeways literally helping to spread the violence unfortunately well they always do there is great mobility in this city but once again i think most of its concentrated south central los angeles area ive talked to the sheriff he believes he has his under control very very well at least about an hour ago are they going to break any of their people loose once they have the thing up at honor ranch shut down if we need the sheriff he will be very happy to but right now hes concentrating and taking care of his situation if he has his under control hell loan us anything he has if and when the national guard comes in how will this be coordinated will the l a p d basically be coordinating this whos in charge once the national guard does come in the national guard is given missions we indicate to the national guard what we want them to do we simply turn them loose and say just go do that they are skilled at guarding an area and that will be the missions that we will provide them chief we through several areas and noticed that it took a while for police response to go into certain areas we saw looting we saw people being attacked on the streets some residents were complaining that the police if this were beverly hills that they would have responded much sooner if it were beverly hills they have more police officers than we do by far per square inch but we have responded as quickly as we possibly can it makes no sense to respond with just two police officers in a car that does not work so we had to for up in squads weve done that as quickly as we possibly could and then sent those squads out as we send those squads out then we are reacting to the situation but i will agree that it is much too slow its slow for me ive been on my people all night and directing them to put more and more people out there its one of those things that just takes awhile to get organized its a different organization than we ordinarily have but we are moving as quickly as we can to do that what about your million dollar plan did that come too late im sorry the million dollars that you anticipated in overtime no that was a well thought out plan that we will be able to take care of most of the overtime if we bring this under control well be able to pay for most of that overtime and that means that the rest of the city wont go lacking in police service in the future how long do you think a curfew will be necessary chief i dont have any idea i think thats dependent upon the people of this community hopefully they will go home tonight get a good nights rest and decide that this is nonsense and they ought to stop it that was l a police chief daryl gates speaking live from the streets of los angeles on the mounting crisis there he was offering his comments on the response of the police officers there he said that once the police officers have been able to get into areas they have been very effective he urged residents to stay calm and to stay away and stay in their homes he also said the curfew that was rumored before will be in effect thursday and there have been bans announced on the sales of guns and on the sale of gasoline into any other containers other than a car
