almost two out of three homicides in the united states involve guns no investigation of violence would be complete without considering whether restricting guns might save lives but thats a question that produces more arguments than conclusions the rhythms of livestock and crops set the pace of marvin world all spring and summer long we see the new hatch we see come around rabbits things like that his farm in lone tree iowa is a long way from the big city and a long way from big city fears of guns and violence to marvin his guns are a source of pride he teaches gun safety classes and he makes his own ammunition he uses his guns for sport and as tools farm implements to protect his crops and animals legitimate needs in his view that may be threatened by proposals to restrict guns okay might as well load up for him all guns at a gun club for instance just wouldnt work i mean i would hate to have to me run clear to a gun club just to get a firearm because maybe i have trouble with a fox or a coyote or something like that maybe getting into livestock and i want a gun right away on farms firearms are used for pest control in dealing with animals predators and things like that they have more of a business function than they often do in cities the relationship between guns and violence is far from simple yet studies indicate that in certain circumstances gun laws have saved lives for instance washington d cs ban on hand gun sales after the law went into effect in late nineteen seventy six homicides and gun suicides went down and overall the rates of homicide and suicide committed by means other than guns did not change the researchers estimate forty seven lives were saved each year unfortunately after crack hit the streets violent death rates shot up back on the farm gun related deaths are more likely to be suicide than murder that controlling hand guns isnt going to make a bit of difference as far as we can detect or very little difference in terms of farmers suicides self inflicted death because they tend not to use them the gun debate is not just urban versus rural just a couple of towns over from marvin farm lives betsy ross to her guns are a reminder of the pain she felt after her husband killed himself he just picked it up propped it against the in the trunk leaned against it reached down and pulled the trigger now he wouldnt have done that if that gun hadnt been right there for him to just reach out and pick up she wrote a book as a way to support other survivors of suicide most committed with guns is the problem guns or people guns kill people gun availability and gun laws are basically irrelevant really what would i say bull its not clear cut say researchers who find guns and people have a complex relationship of competing risks and benefits for the average person whos trying to make sense out of this data it could be quite confusing unfortunately i think that confusion serves a political agenda the national rifle association charges the leading public health researchers are incompetent and should loose federal funding no one challenges work that is anti gun the media love it bureaucrats love it they simply dont apply the same standards to researchers in those areas im not anti gun im anti homicide im anti gunshot injury im anti people being crippled for life when their spine is severed by a bullet art is no more honest personally than he is in his research opposing the n r a are gun control lobbyists on both sides lobbyists argue positions that often go beyond what research data can support because ill tell you the problem of violence the problem of guns is just getting overwhelming at times the politics also seem overwhelming yet researchers have faith that by sorting through the facts understanding eventually will emerge insight on how to take into account people who use guns for defense or for business researchers recognize guns unlike some virus do not by themselves cause the disease of violence guns are only one piece of the violence picture if you did away with all guns tomorrow youd still have a violent society singing his truth is marching on these are the voices that violence in america threatens to silence every single day i go to the morgue and i see children and they have lots of bullet holes in their bodies or they have lots of stab wounds if these junior high school boys die before they become adults the most likely reasons will be murder or suicide all these intellectual folks with all these brains and all these degrees dont have any idea what the deal is they dont have any idea how to save your life but you do researchers seek answers to violence by seeking to know the people violence consumes that journey toward knowledge has just begun with the consensus that violence is more than a matter for police and prisons its a threat to life and health that can be studied like cancer or heart disease and when we started doing this stuff we would publish something and people would say ho hum wed never hear it was like dropping a rock into a well and not hearing anything so its good that people care about it researchers draw a parallel to tobacco smoking a deadly behavior that was once accepted is now shunned that same thing is true about violence that its a learned behavior and that it can be in iowa legislators recently met with researchers seeking guidance on what to do about violence we dont have a sound basis for information that having a gun is more dangerous than not having a gun im absolutely convinced thats so but most of my colleagues are not to know what to do researchers and policy makers must have clear vision clear information on violent acts and right here its happened again another shooting another statistic as soon as police arrived at the scene they started gathering information about the drive by shooting of a young man were going to have to take you up for an operation you know that right at the hospital doctors gathered even more information about the patient and his wounds but most or all of that information remains locked in individual files out of the reach of researchers who need better data in order to draw a clear picture of the damage violence government files do show more than fifty thousand lives lost each year to homicide and suicide in the united states researchers estimate there may be a hundred times that many injured survivors five million each year but no one really knows for sure hes gonna find one of his little buddies and hes gonna get somethin to hurt dad or dad gonna hurt him efforts to treat violence are in their infancy i think that anyone who believes that were going to have a major impact on firearm violence in less than fifteen to twenty years is kidding themselves but i want my children and my childrens children to have a safer country to live in on wilkins first birthday her guardians have that same wish some day her uncle may have to explain to her a world in which mother was shot down just because she was standing on the wrong street corner i think a lot of times about the other families who are going through the same thing ive gone through or who will go through the same things in the future and the children growing aware of the violence swirling around them eroding the foundations of their lives those children must be treated those children must be handled they must be redirected those children must be helped happy birthday to you happy birthday to you
