live from washington crossfire on the left mike kinsley on the right pat buchanan tonight nannygate in the crossfire juan williams columnist for the washington post and in los angeles attorney gloria allred good evening welcome to crossfire washington spent the weekend in nannygate on friday a second woman judge kimba wood lost her chance to be attorney general after it emerged that she had hired an illegal alien to care for her child on sunday commerce secretary ron brown admitted that he had not paid social security for his three hour a week cleaning lady so why should brown a man get to keep his job is the clinton administration guilty of a double standard absolutely not for one thing this issue was never an issue it never occurred to anyone to make it an issue until zoe baird voluntarily disclosed it so no one knew so no one was subjected to a double standard while some feminists are angry at clinton for dumping kimba wood some conservatives are saying this trouble serves him right for insisting on a woman and critics of all stripes are wondering if the clinton administration will ever get its act together gloria allred it seems to me that you should be furious a kimba wood not at bill clinton she is the reason she is not going to be attorney general is not has nothing to do with her nanny it has to do with the fact that she tried to the president of the united states three times she was asked do you have a zoe baird problem she didnt say well not really let me explain the difference she said number now they decided when the facts finally came out that they had been snookered and they cant trust her isnt that perfectly reasonable no it isnt and i dont believe in blaming the victim michael she exercised her judgment she told them she did not have a zoe baird problem she didnt have a zoe baird problem she acted at all times lawfully she did all the filing all the disclosure paid all the taxes did much more than millions of americans do i might add and i think its tremendously unfair to try to punish her now but saying that she didnt disclose we had an administration that said read my lips i dont want an administration now that says read my mind but its not a question of reading the administrations mind its a question of reading kimba woods mind you know perfectly well that when she said no to that question do you have a kimba wood problem she was hiding information that they would have liked to have had and they had a right to have before they made that decision whether you agree with the decision they make or not i think theres a miscommunication here but i do think that the burden should be on the administration to fully articulate what its questions are what its concerns are and if it had this concern then it should have fully articulated she shouldnt be blamed for not having tried to read between the lines of what they were trying to find out oh come on you mean to say when they said to her do you have a zoe baird problem it never crossed her mind to mention the fact that shed hired an illegal alien even though for technical reasons it was legal well it was legal and it always has been legal and if they had political considerations that they were taking into account then they should have articulated them im more concerned about the fact that ron brown has paid his social security taxes late and this is something that perhaps was not legal for him to do at the time that he failed to pay now hes taking care of the problem im glad that he has but hes not going to lose his position on account of it but she unfortunately will not enjoy the position of attorney general exactly solely on account of the fact that she has done everything legally exactly gloria well stated juan does she not have a point kimba wood does not have a zoe baird problem but ron brown does for years ron brown has not paid the social security taxes on his household worker and hes not in any trouble and kimba wood has been bounced wait this is not a double standard by any means you draw it up as if its an equal equation here with two things of equal weight on either side in fact its not in fact ron brown went through the confirmation process this issue was not raised because the flags had not gone up in washington around this issue of illegal aliens hired as help juan im not putting an equal sign between them im saying kimba wood didnt do anything wrong in handling her nanny for the last seven years her babysitter and ron brown has ducked paying social security taxes his situation is worse than hers is what im saying he got through hes not in trouble shes out dont tell me thats not a double standard thats the definition of it number i mean obviously you dont realize that in this town you go through periods where certain issues become an absolute yellow flag in terms of confirmation hearings at the moment that yellow flag is up for people who have somehow hired illegal aliens or not paid the social security taxes as the law them to do that was not the case when brown went through were talking about ron brown now no i think its absolutely true that brown broke the law brown has made for his problem and said that he was wrong but its just the case that were talking about confirmation gloria three women went through the confirmation process before zoe baird and like the men including ron brown who went through that process they were not asked about their domestic help or anything like that it wasnt an issue then since that time zoe baird has become an issue men and women alike have been asked about it charles a very distinguished attorney here in washington who was on the short list for attorney general got bounced cause he had a social security problem hes a man i dont see how you can argue theres a double standard well there is a double standard because the first victims were women and the people most likely to be hurt by all of this are women there are single parents millions of them in this country who are trying to be creative everyday trying to figure out how theyre going to take care of their children and that by the way is because of twelve years of absolute neglect of the child care crisis by the reagan and the bush administration and i think the government has put women in this position and there is going to be a very definite impact on women what are we going to be looking for now only women who have lived in wait a second ms allred let me just ask you a question isnt it the case that zoe baird was the one who raised this nobody went to her and said zoe what about your child care situation she volunteered this information understanding that it could compromise her as the leading official of justice in the united states and said if this is a problem let me know well the white house essentially says no big deal its o k with us people in the house and the senate said no big deal but it turns out the american people said it was a big deal why would you blame president clinton for that i dont blame president clinton but i do ask for leadership by president clinton we heard of stand by your man well id like him to stand by his woman wait a minute id like kimba wood to be the next attorney general wait a minute i just want to clarify this gloria gloria you do agree with me that the double standard is people who happened to be confirmed zoe baird versus people who happen to be confirmed after her irrespective of their sex and men and women of both sexes that about covers it have both been caught almost everybody theyre caught in the gears afterwards and got away with it beforehand so it may be a double standard but it has nothing to do with sexual discrimination kimba wood wasnt getting away with anything the judge showed the highest ethical standards by complying with all laws and she tried to pull a fast one of the president of the united states you refuse to admit that well i think the fast one is perhaps the rationalization afterwards for why her name is no longer there and up for nomination as attorney general o k and i just think that its unfair to victimize her twice first by forcing her to withdraw and second by attacking her and somehow saying that she had the burden of coming forth with this she had the burden of answering a question giving information that she knew darn well they wanted and she purposely didnt bring it forth all right let me ask juan a question juan youve made the point that zoe baird came forward and indicated she had a problem she did the right thing why didnt ron brown do that i dont think anybody asked him it wasnt on the table but you just said that zoe baird came forth and did it zoe baird and admitted shed done something wrong thats right and this guys a seven hundred fifty thousand dollar a year big time lawyer didnt pay any of the social security taxes for his help zoe baird comes forward and tells the truth shes out kimba wood didnt do anything shes out ron brown covered up he stays in the cabinet how do you explain that to the women of america that theres no double standard theres no cover up here at most you can say theres a sin of omission why didnt ron brown volunteer this information maybe ron brown at the time wasnt aware that he had broken the law maybe ron brown considered in the way that zoe baird and the way that other people in this town you know would you accept that for you know if ed meese said i wasnt aware that was the law id say mr meese youd make a dead run to the washington post and youd be writing all night you got it and id also expect that mr meese would make up for it in just the way that ron brown has done and that both these men had been confirmed before the issue was raised you seem to want to ignore that gloria doesnt it make you slightly sick to hear pat buchanan coming on here as the great defender of women and dont you feel that by raising this fuss you are giving aid and comfort to people like pat as opposed to bill clinton whos clearly knocking himself out to find women for his cabinet and has done a heck of a lot better than pats boss or any president that ever came before him well it does make me slightly queasy to be on the same side as pat buchanan but as they say politics makes strange bedfellows and it couldnt be stranger in this case but i will say that we do have to hold the clintons and the administration as much as i support them and i do to the highest standards and we need to educate the american public that this is not the same situation with kimba wood where she did comply with all the laws kimba wood did comply with all the laws and zoe baird did not by the way what about the complete self righteousness and the moral hypocrisy in washington i think if youre going to ask these questions of cabinet appointees each and every senator each and every member of congress ought to answer those questions themselves as to whether theyve ever hired anyone who was undocumented whether theyve paid all the social security taxes workers comp and all the rest of it and ill bet the answer by many of them would be number o k gloria well stated how serious is the political mess in which the clinton white house finds itself that issue just as soon as we come back welcome back because she failed to level with the white house about having hired an illegal alien as a babysitter seven years ago judge kimba wood will not be attorney general of the united states kimba wood did not jump she was pushed overboard by the clinton white house did the white house do the right thing and why cant them seem to get it right our guests in california feminist attorney gloria allred and here in washington journalist juan williams of the washington post and sometime co host of crossfire juan we have had a real debacle with the zoe baird thing and now the kimba wood thing and the mess over attorney general isnt this the inevitable result when you try to make the united states department of justice a gender set aside for feminists well i think if you want to look at it in terms of the bean counting criticism i guess you could make that comment but youve also got to understand that if you want to bean count all weve had over there are white males pat and what youre saying here is on the clinton part were trying to open up this process were going to look and see if there are qualified women and there are qualified women available for that position but juan williams look what mr clinton has said in effect is that if youre a white male lawyer you need not apply for my department of justice now if anyone had said excuse me that we dont want any women applications for justice and no black applications for justice you would go bonkers youre right o k but why is it o k to say that all the men who are judges white males all the men who are lawyers all the men who are heading up law departments at various universities they are unqualified they are out of consideration why is that right well youre wrong on two points one is no one said that there are not qualified applications not desired they can apply in fact jerry chuck other people have certainly applied and been considered the big point here is that our history as americans indicates that we have had discrimination against women against blacks against hispanics asians and that the clinton people are very interested in making sure that everyone is considered for these appointments theyre not considering everyone theyre ruling out white males no theyre simply saying that we have well you do when you say theyre ruling out men when you say that my attorney general is going to be a woman that tends as michael pointed out to rule out that other sex which is males number are you telling me chuck a woman or jerry is a woman no these are people who are being considered for the job even as we sit here they would have listen look the governor former is a former governor of virginia if they werent after a woman he would be attorney general right now why isnt he whats wrong well im certainly not going to ask gloria allred whats wrong with looking for a woman let me put it the other way to you gloria once again you see how youre falling right into pats trap here clinton said i dont think he ever said i insist on having a woman what he said is im going to be more imaginative and more energetic in seeking a diverse cabinet and he did that that takes risks with it you tend to go to names that are not as well known as other names and you end up with some setbacks as hes had would you blame him if at this point he said i am going to go for the most prestigious judge or law school dean i can find and if thats a man so be it absolutely weve got to have a woman as attorney general look this has been a mens club in the department of justice from the beginning of time its time to break through the glass ceiling in government government is the largest employer in the nation it sets the moral tone and president clinton has got to show leadership and have a woman in there we cant have only three women in the cabinet out of fourteen positions thats what president bush had weve got to do better than that and we have to have at least one more and thats in the department of justice you know but ms allred the idea that the only woman that can be in the white house as a lawyer is the wife of the president is completely unacceptable this is nineteen ninety three we need an attorney general whos a woman you know whats interesting here ms allred is that in fact when you look at zoe record or when you come forward and look at kimba woods record you see that in fact theyre pretty conservative in many of the positions theyve taken you know i dont think theres any doubt about zoe baird at aetna and the kind of positions she was taking anti litigation and so forth along dan quayle lines and when you look at the fact that bush appointed kimba wood to the federal judiciary i think that in fact you need women who have more liberal credentials dont you well i like that there are plenty of feminist women lawyers and women judges out there theres the national women judges association we have hundreds of names we could provide anytime from the national womens political caucus we have provided names let me ask you gloria the question that pat cant ask you cause of our format tonight if you had a choice between someone who agreed with your views about legal issues and happened to be a man or someone who disagreed with them and happened to be a woman would you really pick the woman those are false alternatives because i want a woman with feminist views you want your cake and eat it too who believes in with a record of civil rights and consumer rights and there are many women out there who will fit that description and that doesnt have a nanny problems let me get to you juan on the this is the larger thing republicans havent really gone after bill clinton he is stumbling all over the lot i mean is this just as casey cant anybody here play this game is this just a couple of mistakes or is this endemic in this administration its in trouble well theyre in trouble theyre having a little trouble coming out of the box but i think that its quick to condemn anybody i mean im not condemning them theyre theyre just here i mean theyre just getting set theyre just trying to get their staffing theyre trying to get the phones to work it is every i mean these arent this isnt pat buchanan conservative journalists are saying its the worst start up of any administration they can ever recall what is the problem and what did they say when reagan was starting and what did they say when bush was starting if they always say it its the same old cant were in the same town its like tribal rites my goodness and once again gloria arent you giving aid and comfort to the people who are saying these sorts of things by raising a fuss over clinton when the blame really goes in this last i mean i agree with the zoe baird thing he blew it he made a mistake of judgment but i cannot see what he did wrong in this kimba wood thing when she kept the crucial facts secret from him no i mean women have been told to keep silent for many years for two hundred years at least oh wait now theres a war oh wait now theres an economic problem just be silent and finally someone will address our concerns later when its more convenient when theres a better time no this is a time we have to address it as we go along and i know that president and hillary clinton will do their best to have a feminist woman as attorney general but weve got to also really have a strict scrutiny of what they are doing and the process as we go all right lets take a break and when we come back were going to talk about another little corner of this kimba wood business the playboy bunny scandal gloria allred somehow it leaked out during this mess last week that kimba wood thirty years ago had spent a few days training to work in a playboy club in london now i dont find that in any way a bad thing about kimba wood i dont think you do juan doesnt ill bet even pat buchanan doesnt so why are people trying to make such a big deal out of that well i think that perhaps some people suspect the presidents motives that they think that maybe this was the real flap that he was concerned about and didnt want to be subjected to jokes on late night talk shows about having a playboy bunny or maybe that doesnt even make sense a as the attorney general of the united states maybe that was the real reason i dont know most people i know seems unlikely doesnt it dont even care if she became a playboy bunny which she never did but you know why the point is that this obviously was leaked out by the clinton people in the white house and look what she did twenty three years old working as whether it was a in a playboy bunny club is going to be good for a laugh for one night at the talk show host but nobody was going to withhold approving her on that ground of course not so what is the accusation against the clinton people the clinton people leaked it out nobody knew that isnt that right yeah the clinton people let it out but thats the point is here the clinton people were saying heres the entire record this woman had not been fully truthful with us about the zoe baird problem were putting it all out in terms of things that weighed against her in our mind you know what i think they were defending a decision they knew was inherently and maybe even cowardly to dump the woman what are you talking about they dumped her and then they wanted to defend themselves we had a lot of trouble oh come on pat they dumped her sure they did she eventually came forward with information they were unaware of and put them in a compromising position and they panicked and dumped her they could have got her through all right well get to that at the end pat i want to come back to that but last question to gloria arent things that clinton has already done as president like lifting the abortion gag rule and pushing through that family leave bill far more important for women than this little fuss over kimba wood well i think its very significant all of the abortion rights legislation that he signed and ordered and all of the family leave bill which weve struggled so long to get into law and of course there are many challenges ahead but its still very important that women be in the palace of power in the white house that we have an opportunity to participate in important decisions that affect womens lives because our daughters need role models we need women as leaders and there is no substitute for women in the white house ive got to cut you off at that point thank you gloria allred out in l a thank you juan williams here in washington youre welcome ill explain the facts of life to pat in just a moment remember one more week of pat and then john sununu is back for a while meanwhile pat you called clintons decision to dump kimba wood which he obviously did cowardly would president buchanan how would president buchanan react if a cabinet nominee had withheld obviously on purpose information that she knew perfectly well was relevant to his decision well she and then found out about it at the last minute she brought in all these documents and things id take a look at my council and id make a judgment i would not i think it was a cowardly i think they choked michael but you would have pat youre such a hypocrite you would have been livid at this women for stabbing you in the back and denying you this she didnt it wasnt stabbing in the back you know he asked her do you have a zoe baird problem and she used a lot of to get out of answering that question straight michael theyre in trouble because of this idiotic policy of making the justice department and youre evading my question just the way she evaded from the left im mike kinsley good night for crossfire from the right pat buchanan join us tomorrow night for another edition of crossfire primenews is up next heres bernard shaw to give us a sneak preview bernie
