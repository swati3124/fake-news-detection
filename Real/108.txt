its generally acknowledged that people dont read as much as they used to indeed it seems the closest an entire generation gets to a book these days is when one is turned into a t v movie of the week youd think that would bother an author of the status of kurt vonnegut but as mark bailey reports vonnegut feels his work transfers quite well from words to visuals hello im kurt vonnegut my father was an architect and it seems to me that i myself have designed this structure something like this except ive provided something that architects dont provide which is a world behind each door welcome to the monkey house and the latest stories in the anthology by the same name to be turned into television for unlike many authors who fear that hollywood only serves to trivialize serious writing vonnegut welcomes the opportunity to see his work performed on screen some of the people you would have to deal with are the scum of the earth obviously really not very nice or gifted people but ive been very lucky and i have said that there are two novelists that ought to be crazy over hollywood im one of them because the job they did on slaughter house five vonnegut that the other is margaret mitchell gone with the wind having held up fairly well four new of y house are set to air on beginning wednesday night with an episode titled fortitude in it vonnegut explores just how far man and technology should go to prolong life this about a woman who is so wealthy shes left a billion dollars that she can hire the best medical help available and so finally the story opens and shes nothing but a head on top of a post and theres this huge engine room down below which is her kidney or lungs and everything else a topic torn from todays headlines not hardly vonnegut wrote fortitude in nineteen fifty three future episodes of monkey house promise the same type of biting social commentary faithful to the authors original work and if his fans have any doubts vonnegut suggests they try something really bold for the nineties read the book im very fortunate because everything ive ever done remains in print and its a usual experience for authors to write something and have it sink like a stone after a year or a couple of years and then the movie becomes the only representative of the work of art and so the writer gets hysterical but i wrote the books you know thats what i do
