1)INSTALL BLLIPPARSER FOR PYTHON 2.7
2)RUN GET_LOG_SCORE.PY 
3)THIS WILL GENERATE OUTPUT_PGRAMS_FAKE.CSV , OUTPUT_PGRAMS_REAL.CSV. THIS WILL CONTAIN THE PGRAM VALUE FOR EVERY SENTENCE  
IN A FILE, FOR EVERY FAKE/REAL FILE RESPECTIVELY.
4)EXECUTE THE SVM.PY FILE. THIS WILL FEED THE PGRAMS VALUE FROM THE OUTPUT_PGRAMS_FAKE, OUTPUT_PGRAMS_REAL TO THE SVM AND TRAIN
THE SVM ON IT. AT THE SAME TIME THE LABELS OF THE CORRESPONDING FILES WILL ALSO BE FED TO THE SVM.
5)AFTER THIS WE WILL BE TESTING THE TRAINED SVM TO GET THE PREDICTED LABEL.
