WELCOME BACK 
THE LEADER OF THE BOSNIAN SERBS PROPOSED A NEW APPROACH TO SETTLING THE FOUR YEAR OLD BOSNIAN CONFLICT BY ASKING JIMMY CARTER TO MEDIATE THE BLOODY WAR 
I DO THINK THAT PRESIDENT CARTER IN THE CAPACITY OF A POSSIBLE AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE OR PRESIDENT CLINTON'S REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE AND WOULD BE IMPARTIAL 
WE ARE PROPOSING AN IMMEDIATE END OF THE WAR 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT LEFT ATLANTA FOR FRANKFURT THIS EVENING FLYING COMMERCIALLY AND UNACCOMPANIED BY STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS 
THIS IS A MISSION BY PRESIDENT CARTER THAT IS NOT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES BUT ON BEHALF OF HIS CENTER THE CARTER CENTER 
HE'S BEEN INVITED IN THAT CAPACITY 
OBVIOUSLY WE SAY GOD BLESS HIM 
IF HE CAN FIND A WAY TO SOLVE SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS FINE 
BUT WE'RE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE ABILITY TO DO THAT 
MONA IF JIMMY CARTER CAN SETTLE THE BOSNIAN WAR ISN'T HIS TRIP WORTHWHILE 
RIGHT AND IF HE CAN WALK ON WATER SURE 
BUT LOOK KARADZIC IS MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS HE'S A PSYCHIATRIST AN EVIL ONE BUT ANYWAY AND HE'S VERY GOOD AT PLAYING UPON PEOPLES' EMOTIONS 
HE'S TERRORIZED SARAJEVO VERY EFFECTIVELY AND HE IS PLAYING UPON JIMMY CARTER'S VANITY 
TO COME BRING CARTER OVER THERE MUDDY THE WATERS ON THESE NEGOTIATIONS SO THAT YOU'VE GOT A MILLION DIFFERENT PARTIES INVOLVED AND TRY TO GET A BETTER DEAL FOR HIMSELF MORE TERRITORY THAT IS FOR THE BOSNIAN SERBS THAN HE WAS BEING OFFERED BY THE CONTRACT GROUP 
MARGARET IS THIS EXPLOSIVE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE PLAYING WITH PRESIDENT CARTER 
I DON'T THINK THE WHITE HOUSE HAS DISTANCED ITSELF ENOUGH FROM THIS CARTER MISSION 
I MEAN THERE NEEDS TO BE A CARTER CONTAINMENT POLICY NOW 
NO MORE PEACE MISSIONS 
NO MORE BUCKING FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE 
I MEAN HE'S GOING TO SAY IS MISUNDERSTOOD THE WAY HE SAID KIM IL SUNG WAS MISUNDERSTOOD AND START TALKING ABOUT HIS WIFE AND MAKE CONCESSIONS AND THEN TALK ABOUT IT LATER 
LEON PANETTA WAS ON EVANS AND NOVAK 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT SHOW BOB BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE A WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF DISTANCING HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT 
HE WAS DISTANCING SOMEWHAT 
LET ME SAY SOMETHING FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT 
YOU KNOW BEEN BASHING JIMMY CARTER ON THIS PROGRAM FOR MONTHS 
SHE BASHED HIM WHEN HE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING A BLOODBATH IN HAITI 
SHE BASHED HIM WHEN HE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING A SECOND KOREAN WAR 
SO I THINK THAT I THINK JIMMY CARTER DESERVES THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE 
I THINK HE'S BEEN SPECTACULAR IN THESE PEACE MISSIONS AND IF HE CAN GET AVOID SENDING TWO AMERICAN DIVISIONS TO BOSNIA THE DISASTER THAT BOTH THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL POWERFUL ALL THE MORE POWER TO HIM 
DON'T FORGET THAT THE SERBS HAVE WON THIS WAR 
THEY'VE ALREADY WON IT AND ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET SOME KIND OF PEACE SETTLEMENT 
CHUCK SCHUMER WHO'S RIGHT MONA CHAREN OR BOB NOVAK 
I AGREE WITH MONA 
I THINK JIMMY 
SORRY BOB 
YOU KNOW THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I THINK THAT CARTER JUST GOES OFF ON THESE THINGS I'M SURE IF YOU HEARD WHAT LEON PANETTA WOULD SAY PRIVATELY IT WOULDN'T BE AS MILD AS THAT AND HE'S BEING USED 
OF COURSE 
HE'S BEING USED 
OF COURSE 
THERE YOU KNOW SURE 
IF HE BRINGS SUCCESS EVERYONE WILL HAIL HIM BUT HOW MANY TIMES IS THIS GUY GOING TO GO FLY OFF FLY OFF FLY UP AND WHO ELSE IS GOING TO GO 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST AN AVERAGE CITIZEN 
WELL YOU CAN ALWAYS GET A 
HE'S THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
IF HE WERE JUST JIMMY CARTER CITIZEN HE WOULDN'T BE GOING 
AS FORMER PRESIDENT HE CARRIES THE MANTLE OR THE AURA OF BEING SOMEHOW ATTACHED TO THE GOVERNMENT 
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
JUST A QUICK REPLY TO BOB'S TWO POINTS ABOUT HAITI AND NORTH KOREA 
IN NORTH KOREA THE PRESIDENT THE FORMER PRESIDENT BROUGHT BACK A TERRIBLE DEAL WHICH REALLY INVOLVED U. S. CAPITULATION AND WHICH WE WILL PAY THE PIPER FOR DOWN THE ROAD AND AS FOR HAITI IT'S HARD TO SAY BOB 
DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT WE HE AVOIDED A BLOODBATH 
WHAT SORT OF A BLOODBATH WAS IN PROSPECT 
OKAY 
AND ALSO I THINK THE PLANES TAKING OFF HAD AN EFFECT AS WELL 
ALL RIGHT 
LAST WORD MARGARET 
YOU'RE DOING IT TWICE IN A ROW 
TWICE 
CHUCK SCHUMER THANKS FOR BEING WITH US 
THANK YOU 
THE GANG WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE OUTRAGE OF THE WEEK 
AND NOW FOR THE OUTRAGE OF THE WEEK 
ROBERT KENNEDY ONCE SHREWDLY OBSERVED THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST ANYTHING AT ANY TIME 
WELL THE LATEST WALL STREET JOURNAL SLASH N. B. C. POLL SHOWS THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR AMERICANS DO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE NOW FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR 
HOW MANY OPPOSE SUCH AN INCREASE FOR OUR LOWEST WAGE EARNERS 
YOU GUESSED IT TWENTY PERCENT NONE OF WHOM YOU CAN BE SURE IS MAKING FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR 
BOB 
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS SENDING THREE THOUSAND MARINES BACK TO SOMALIA 
HAVEN'T WE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT COUNTRY 
NO WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THE DEPARTURE OF THE LAST U. N. PEACEKEEPERS AND TO PICK UP U. S. MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND 
ONE AMERICAN LIFE LOST IN THIS DUBIOUS VENTURE WOULD BE ONE TOO MANY 
MONA 
A JURY IN OKLAHOMA CITY HAS SENTENCED A MAN CONVICTED OF RAPING A THREE YEAR OLD GIRL TO THIRTY THOUSAND YEARS IN JAIL 
THE OUTRAGE IS TWOFOLD 
FIRST THAT THE EXASPERATED JURY FELT IT HAD TO ISSUE SUCH A LUDICROUS SENTENCE TO ENSURE THAT THE RAPIST WOULD NOT GO FREE IN A FEW YEARS AND THE SECOND OUTRAGE IS THAT DESPITE THE THIRTY THOUSAND YEAR SENTENCE THE RAPIST WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE IN FIFTEEN YEARS 
WHY NOT SIMPLIFY MATTERS AND JUST ELIMINATE PAROLE 
MARGARET CARLSON 
AN AUDIT REVEALED THAT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PAID THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO SETTLE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT AGAINST FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE DAVID WATKINS 
THE F. E. C. HAS DISALLOWED FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT BUT THAT'S NOT THE REAL PROBLEM 
WATKINS RATHER THAN BEING DEMOTED WAS MADE DIRECTOR OF WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION 
IN THAT JOB HE A MILITARY HELICOPTER TO TAKE HIMSELF AND A FEW PALS ON A GOLF OUTING TO CAMP DAVID 
ONLY THEN DID THE WHITE HOUSE GET IT 
CAN I ASK YOU A SERIOUS QUESTION 
YEAH 
A FRIVOLOUS QUESTION 
IS THERE SOMETHING REALLY BAD IN THAT WHOLE ARKANSAS CROWD AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
I MEAN THERE'S ONE REAL STRANGE THING AFTER ANOTHER 
UM HMM 
WELL THEY DO THERE'S NO LESSON LEARNED 
I MEAN THEY JUST CAN KEEP MAKING MISTAKES WITH NO CONSEQUENCES AND THE JUDGMENT 
NO BUT THEY MAKE 
THE WATKINS THING IS SO SERIOUS THAT WHEN YOU PAY THIRTY SEVEN I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY PAYING MONEY OUT OF A CAMPAIGN 
THAT MUCH MONEY 
YEAH 
FOR A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGE 
RIGHT 
AND THEY CALLED IT CONSULTING FEES 
BUT THEN TO BRING THE GUY 
EXCEPT SENATOR 
YEAH 
NO NO 
BUT THEN TO BRING THE GUY TO THE WHITE HOUSE I MEAN SOMETIMES 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
DO YOU KNOW HE'S A MILLIONAIRE 
DID YOU KNOW THAT WATKINS 
IS HE REALLY 
HE'S A VERY RICH MAN 
IS HE REALLY 
IS HE IN FAVOR OF A CUT IN THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
LIKE YOU BOB 
YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
BUT HE'S A VERY RICH MAN 
AND HE RESISTED PAYING FOR THAT HELICOPTER TRIP TOO 
THIS IS MARK SHIELDS SAYING GOOD NIGHT FOR THE CAPITAL GANG AND YOU'LL JOIN US NEXT WEEK WHEN HUMORIST MARK RUSSELL ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT SATIRISTS JOINS US FOR OUR ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PROGRAM
