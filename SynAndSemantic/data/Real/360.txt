WEEKEND EDITION ENTERTAINMENT CRITIC ELVIS MITCHELL JOINS US FROM OUR STUDIO IN NEW YORK 
ELVIS GOOD TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN 
HOWDY NEAL 
YOU ALWAYS THINK JAZZ MOVIES ARE GOING TO BE TERRIFIC THEY'RE ABOUT A UNIQUE KIND OF LIFE BUT DOES THIS ONE FALL INTO THOSE KIND OF YOU KNOW SMOKY CAFE CLICHES THAT HAPPEN SO OFTEN 
NO IT SORT OF DOESN'T BECAUSE IT REALLY DEALS WITH THE WAY THESE TWO GUYS WHO SORT OF LIVE THIS MARGINAL LIFE ARE TRYING TO SORT OF GRAB ALL THEY CAN OUT OF IT 
AND YOU KNOW JEFF MARRIED TO THE WONDERFUL KATHY BAKER IN THIS MOVIE AND SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T QUITE GET HOME ON TIME FOR THE WRONG REASONS AND FORREST WHITAKER JUST TRIES TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE INSTRUMENT 
WHAT YOU REALLY GET OUT OF THIS IS A YOU KNOW THESE GUYS REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER AND WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S KIND OF ANECDOTAL 
FORREST WHITAKER OF COURSE PLAYED A JAZZ MUSICIAN CHARLIE PARKER IN BIRD THE CLINT EASTWOOD MOVIE 
JEFF GOLDBLUM MAY BE BEST REMEMBERED AS THE FLY 
THEY PLAY TWO MUSICIANS ONE BLACK ONE WHITE 
IS THIS KIND OF AN I DON'T KNOW A BUDDY MOVIE 
I GUESS IT IS 
I THINK GOLDBLUM WAS IN THAT WHAT WAS IT JURASSIC SOMETHING OR ANOTHER LAST SUMMER 
I THINK THAT MADE SOME MONEY YEAH 
YEAH ITS UNIMPORTANT 
I'M GLAD HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT MAY ACTUALLY MAKE A LOT OF DOUGH FOR HIM HERE ON 
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS IN TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCES THAT THE WRITER SLASH DIRECTOR MICHAEL ELIAS GETS OUT OF THE ACTORS JEFF GOLDBLUM TENDS TO DO SOMETHING THAT MOST ACTORS CAN'T 
HE'S BETTER WITH A PAUSE THAN MOST ACTORS ARE WITH ACTUAL DIALOGUE 
BUT WHAT HE DOES HERE IS GIVEN AN UNAFFECTED NATURAL AND I THINK REAL ADULT MOVIE STAR PERFORMANCE HERE 
VIDEO PICK THIS WEEK ELVIS 
GEE I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND WONDERED WHAT COULD I COME UP WITH THAT WOULD BE JAZZ LIKE AND OFFER YOU A SAME KIND OF TAKE ON THE WORLD 
AND I SORT OF CAME UP WITH A MUSICAL MOVIE ABOUT A GUY WHO WANTS TO PLAY JAZZ THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS WITH JEFF AND BEAU BRIDGES AND MICHELLE 
AND AGAIN IT'S ABOUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN BETWEEN TWO MEN THAT'S SORT OF SKEWED 
AND THE WAY BOTH THESE MOVIES FEEL EUROPEAN BECAUSE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR DEBT TO JOY LA GEM AND YOU CAN SORT OF FEEL WHATEVER IT IS THESE WOMEN DO THAT THEY'RE ACCEPTED AND NOT ACCEPTED AND THERE'S A KIND OF REAL IN BOTH I THINK THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS AND IN LIFE ABOUT GUYS WHO DON'T WANT TO QUITE COME OUT OF THE TREE HOUSE YET EVEN THOUGH ITS BEEN TIME FOR THEM TO DO SO A LONG TIME AGO
