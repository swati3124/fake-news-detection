SARI HEADS UP ONE OF THE PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATING TEAMS TO THE PEACE TALKS 
HE SAYS YASIR ARAFAT DID NOT INTRODUCE ANY NEW ISSUES AT YESTERDAY'S TALKS 
THE DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES STATES ISRAEL WILL GIVE UP EVERYTHING IN THE GAZA JERICHO ZONES EXCEPT FOR EXTERNAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
BUT THIS ALSO MEANS IT WILL GIVE UP INTERNAL SECURITY TO THE PALESTINIANS AND I THINK THE FIGHT IS OVER THERE THAT THE DISCUSSIONS ARE NOW YOU KNOW CENTER ABOUT WHERE DOES WHERE DO THE LINES BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SECURITY BECOME VAGUE 
BUT BACK TO THE ISSUE OF EXTERNAL SECURITY AND ISRAEL'S CONCERN ABOUT MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER THE BORDERS VERSUS MR. ARAFAT'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE FREEDOM WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN MOVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND FROM GAZA TO EGYPT 
IS THERE CAN YOU ENVISION A COMPROMISE A WAY OF GETTING THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM 
THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH THINGS CAN BE HANDLED AT THIS STAGE 
AFTER ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INTERIM KIND OF ARRANGEMENT 
EVENTUALLY OF COURSE ISRAEL WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP ALSO THE EXTERNAL SECURITY OVER THE BORDERS AND INDEED THE BORDERS WILL HAVE TO BE WITHDRAWN 
I MEAN AFTER ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVENTUALLY AN AGREEMENT IN WHICH ISRAEL WILL LIVE SIDE BY SIDE WITH A PALESTINIAN ENTITY A STATE WITH A BORDER BETWEEN THEM WHICH WILL BE MORE OR LESS ALONG THE SIXTY SEVEN LINE 
MR. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD 
EXTREMISTS ON BOTH SIDES APPEAR DETERMINED THROUGH THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO DERAIL THESE AGREEMENTS AND BOTH SIDES KEEP SAYING THAT THEY WILL CONTROL THEIR OWN PEOPLE BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING EITHER FOR THE ISRAELIS OR FOR THE PALESTINIANS 
THE QUESTION TO ASK IS YOU KNOW WILL THEIR ACTIVITY EVENTUALLY DOMINATE THE SCENE 
MY OWN FEELING MY OWN PERSONAL ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE OBJECTIVE CONDITIONS WHAT ONE KNOWS ABOUT THE SITUATION ASSURES ME THAT IN FACT THE POLITICAL PROCESS YOU KNOW IN SPITE OF THE IN SPITE OF THE OBSTACLES IN SPITE OF THE DELAYS IT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE 
THUS SLOWLY ERODING IN MY OPINION THE SUPPORT THAT THE OPPONENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. 
YOU'RE WELCOME
