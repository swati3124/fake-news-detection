ELSEWHERE OVERSEAS TODAY THE VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE WAS IN MOSCOW FOR A MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN 
MR. GORE USED UNUSUALLY SHARP LANGUAGE TO CRITICIZE RUSSIA'S NEW LEADER OF THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION 
THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY SAID MR. GORE ARE REPREHENSIBLE 
MR. ZHIRINOVSKY HAS TALKED ABOUT BOMBING GERMANY AND SUPPRESSING ETHNIC MINORITIES AMONG A GREAT MANY OTHER THINGS 
HOW IS IT THAT HIS PARTY DID SO WELL IN SUNDAY'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS 
A. B. C.'S DAVID ENSOR WENT LOOKING FOR ANSWERS 
SEVENTY MILES FROM MOSCOW POPULATION TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
LIFE HAS GROWN SO HARD HERE THAT IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO MOST PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THOSE IN POWER THE REFORMERS 
THE TOWN SPLIT ABOUT EVENLY BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF ZHIRINOVSKY AND THE COMMUNISTS 
I GAVE ZHIRINOVSKY A CHANCE 
HE'S A NEW PERSON 
A COMMON REFRAIN AT THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEAR OLD TEXTILE FACTORY 
THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE GETTING COTTON EVER SINCE THE SOVIET UNION BROKE UP 
THERE HAVE BEEN LAYOFFS 
WE ARE DISINTEGRATING 
TOMORROW OUR FACTORY COULD BE CLOSED AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE 
THAT'S WHERE ZHIRINOVSKY COMES IN 
A RETIRED MILITARY MAN SAYS HE VOTED FOR ZHIRINOVSKY BECAUSE HE PROMISED TO STOP OTHER FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS FROM RUSSIAN RESIDENTS 
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE BEAR A LOT 
WE ARE PATIENT 
BUT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE TEASED 
ALMOST EVERYONE TOLD US THEY ENJOYED BLUNT ATTACKS ON THE NEWLY RICH 
BUT WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT RACIST COMMENTS OR HIS CALL TO RECREATE THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BY FORCE PEOPLE HERE SAY THAT'S NOT THE ZHIRINOVSKY THEY VOTED FOR 
I DON'T THINK OUR RUSSIAN PEOPLE WOULD ALLOW THAT 
ALL WE WANT IS PEACE AND WORK FOR EVERYBODY 
IN TODAY CHILDREN PLACED FLOWERS TO COMMEMORATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY RUSSIAN FORCES RECAPTURED THE TOWN FROM THE NAZIS IN WORLD WAR TWO 
BUT WHEN REFORMERS COMPARE IMPERIAL AMBITIONS WITH THOSE OF HITLER PEOPLE IN DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND 
FASCISM WAS GERMAN THEY SAY 
IT COULD NEVER CATCH ON HERE 
DAVID ENSOR A. B. C. NEWS MOSCOW
