IN CHINA IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DAUNTING AND POLITICALLY RISKY CHALLENGES FACING REFORMERS OVERCOMING THE HARD LINE POLICIES AND ATTITUDES GOVERNING STATE RUN INDUSTRY 
C. N. N.'S MIKE CHINOY EXAMINES THE ISSUE IN TODAY'S SEGMENT OF OUR SERIES THE DRAGON STIRS 
THERE ARE VERY FEW CITIES IN CHINA THESE DAYS WITH STATUES OF CHAIRMAN MAO IN THE MAIN SQUARE 
IS ONE OF THEM 
THE SYMBOLISM IS APPROPRIATE 
WITH ITS FOREST OF SMOKESTACKS THIS INDUSTRIAL CENTER IN NORTHEASTERN CHINA IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORST OF COMMUNIST ECONOMICS 
MOST OF ITS ENTERPRISES ARE RUN BY THE STATE 
THEY ARE UNPRODUCTIVE INEFFICIENT AND IN THE RED 
IT'S THE SAME STORY THROUGHOUT CHINA 
DESPITE EMPLOYING TENS OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS STATE RUN INDUSTRIES ARE NOW BEING DRAMATICALLY OUT PERFORMED BY CHINA'S SMALLER BUT RAPIDLY GROWING PRIVATE SECTOR 
TWO THIRDS OF ALL OUR STATE RUN ENTERPRISES ARE LOSING MONEY 
THEY ARE SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
THEY FEATURE THE SO CALLED IRON RICE BOWL GUARANTEED LIFETIME EMPLOYMENT SO THE WORKERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO WORK AND THE MANAGERS HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO MANAGE 
ALMOST EVERYONE IN CHINA AGREES THAT STATE RUN INDUSTRIES ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF CHANGE 
BUT SMASHING THE IRON RICE BOWL HAS PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DAUNTING AND POLITICALLY RISKY CHALLENGES FACING CHINA'S REFORMERS 
THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF THE REFRIGERATOR FACTORY 
AFTER YEARS OF TURNING OUT SHINY MERCHANDISE AND LOSING MONEY THE GOVERNMENT FINALLY LET IT GO BANKRUPT 
FOR PEOPLE LIKE LIU WHO HAD WORKED AT THE FACTORY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT MEANT THE END OF CRADLE TO GRAVE SECURITY 
SUDDENLY I HAD NO INCOME 
I HAD TO FEND FOR MYSELF AND LOOK FOR A JOB 
LIU WAS LUCKY HIS FACTORY'S ASSETS WERE TAKEN OVER BY A SMALL BUT SUCCESSFUL JOINT VENTURE PLANT 
HE AND SOME OTHER WORKERS WERE GIVEN NEW JOBS 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SO FORTUNATE 
EVERY DAY GROUPS OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE GATHER ON THIS STREET SEEKING JOBS AS DAY LABORERS 
MOST OF THEM ARE VICTIMS OF DECISIONS MADE HERE IN THE BANKRUPTCY OFFICE WHICH HAS SO FAR ALLOWED TWENTY SEVEN STATE RUN FIRMS TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS 
A TINY HANDFUL BUT A RECORD IN CHINA 
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS WHAT TO DO WITH WORKERS WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM 
IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS TOO HIGH THEN YOU'LL GET SOCIAL PROBLEMS 
WE NEED TO AVOID THIS 
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THE GOVERNMENT'S MOVE A DECADE AGO TO BREAK UP THE PEOPLE'S COMMUNES AND ALLOW THE REVIVAL OF PRIVATE FARMING PRODUCED NOT UNREST BUT A BOON 
BUT IN THE MORE POLITICALLY VOLATILE CITIES THE AUTHORITIES CAUGHT BETWEEN THE DEMANDS OF ECONOMIC LOGIC AND THE RISKS OF WORKER UNREST CONTINUE TO TREAD 
THE IRON RICE BOWL IS CRACKING BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN SHATTERED INTO PIECES
