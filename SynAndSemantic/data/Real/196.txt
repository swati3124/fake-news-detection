WELCOME BACK TO LARRY KING LIVE 
THE ANIMATION THAT MAKES US HAPPY THE CHARACTERS KNOWN ROUND THE WORLD THE THEME PARKS THAT HAVE COME TO STAND FOR THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN VACATION WALT DISNEY MEANS HAPPINESS PLAIN AND SIMPLE 
AND THE KEEPERS OF HIS LEGACY WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY 
AND NOW A BIOGRAPHER SAYS THAT UNCLE WALT WAS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE COMPLICATED A SAD CRUEL MAN WHO SPIED ON HIS FELLOW HOLLYWOOD RESIDENTS A HAPPY VISIONARY IN PUBLIC A DARK PRINCE IN PRIVATE 
THAT'S THE VERDICT FROM MARC ELIOT IN HIS NEW BOOK WALT DISNEY HOLLYWOOD'S DARK PRINCE FROM BIRCH LANE PRESS AND THE DISNEY FAMILY IS MAD 
MARC ELIOT JOINS ME NOW 
WHAT LED YOU TO WRITE THIS BOOK 
WELL I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO ARE A LITTLE OLDER THAN I AM AND THEY WERE IN THE FORTIES AND THE FIFTIES AND IT CAME UP ONE NIGHT THAT SOMEONE SAID THAT WALT DISNEY HAD BEEN THE LEADER OF A VIGILANTE ORGANIZATION IN THE FORTIES 
THIS STRUCK ME AS QUITE INTERESTING 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THE POLITICS OF HOLLYWOOD 
SO I TRIED TO RESEARCH THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF DISNEY'S LIFE AND FOUND THAT IT VIRTUALLY WAS NON EXISTENT IN THE AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHIES OF WALT DISNEY 
DIDN'T HE TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE UN AMERICAN ACTIVITIES 
HE MOST CERTAINLY DID 
HE WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WITNESSES AND WHEN HE TESTIFIED HE NAMED SEVERAL PEOPLE AS COMMUNISTS NONE OF WHOM WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION 
BUT THAT WAS KNOWN THAT THE TESTIFIED 
THAT WAS KNOWN 
RIGHT 
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WEREN'T KNOWN INCLUDING HIS BEING ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE THE MOTION PICTURE ALLIANCE WHICH WAS THAT ORGANIZATION THEY WERE REFERRING TO IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
BUT MOST WHAT I FOUND OUT WHEN I THE F. B. I. FOR HIS FILE UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT WAS THAT DISNEY WAS WORKING WITH THE F. B. I. FROM NINETEEN FORTY UNTIL HIS DEATH AND POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN 
BUT DOESN'T THE F. B. I. DENY THAT 
THE F. B. I. HASN'T MADE ANY STATEMENTS 
DIDN'T WILLIAM WEBSTER MAKE A STATEMENT 
WILLIAM WEBSTER IS NOT IN THE F. B. I. 
WILLIAM WEBSTER IS 
WELL A FORMER HEAD OF THE F. B. I. 
A FORMER HEAD OF THE F. B. I. 
HE'S ACTING AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S ACTING 
IS HE A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DISNEY FAMILY 
IS HE ON THE DISNEY PAYROLL 
IS HE A SPOKESMAN 
ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT 
I'M ASKING 
I'M NOT IMPLYING 
I'M ASKING WHO HE'S REPRESENTING AND IN WHAT CAPACITY 
HE SAID DISNEY WASN'T AN EMPLOYEE OF THE F. B. I. AND HE'S THE FORMER HEAD 
AND NOTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN BETWEEN 
DISNEY DIED BEFORE HE LEFT 
BUT HE SPECIFICALLY SAID IN HIS STATEMENT THAT ACCORDING TO THE RELEASED DOCUMENTS THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT WALT DISNEY WAS A SECRET INFORMANT 
THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC COMMENT 
MY REPLY TO THAT IS THE RELEASED DOCUMENTS ARE SIXTY PERCENT OUT AND OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THAT SIXTY PERCENT IS OUT FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY 
MY QUESTION IS WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE IN THOSE DOCUMENTS FIFTY YEARS LATER 
THERE'S NO MORE SOVIET UNION 
THERE'S NO MORE COMMUNIST THREAT IN HOLLYWOOD 
AS FAR AS I KNOW WORLD WAR TWO IS OVER AND HITLER IS DEAD 
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE A QUESTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY 
WHAT'S YOUR GUESS 
MY GUESS IS THAT AS THE FAMILY AND THE STUDIO HAVE DEMONSTRATED FOR THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE DISNEY EXISTENCE THEY FEEL THAT HE IS AN ECONOMIC FACTOR AND THAT THE IMAGE OF WALT DISNEY IS PRECIOUS AND PRICELESS AND MUST BE KEPT INTACT AT ALL COSTS 
ALL RIGHT BUT THAT'S THE FAMILY 
THAT ISN'T THE F. B. I. DOESN'T CARE IF WALT DISNEY MAKES MONEY OR NOT 
THE F. B. I. AS I SAID HASN'T MADE ANY STATEMENT 
I HAVE CALLED UPON THE F. B. I. NOW SINCE THIS HAS BEGUN FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD TO RELEASE ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
THAT WAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE NEW YORK TIMES' WORD THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE C. B. S. NEWS' WORD OR MY WORD OR MR. WEBSTER'S WORD 
BY THE WAY FOUR GROUPS HAVE NOW SEEN THESE DOCUMENTS 
I HAVE SEEN THEM 
I'VE HAD THEM FOR TWO YEARS 
THE NEW YORK TIMES HAD THEM FOR EIGHT WEEKS INDEPENDENTLY CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION I DID THAT WALT DISNEY WAS A SECRET INFORMANT 
LAST FRIDAY C. B. S. NEWS INDEPENDENTLY CONDUCTED ITS OWN THREE WEEK INVESTIGATION OF SOME MATERIAL THAT I SUPPLIED AND SOME THAT THEY FOUND ON THEIR OWN 
THEY CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION 
THEY SAID ON NETWORK T. V. FRIDAY NIGHT THAT WALT DISNEY WAS A SECRET INFORMANT 
BY THE WAY THAT ASIDE AND YOU PRESUME IT RIGHT 
BECAUSE YOU'RE ASSUMING IT TOO 
WELL I AM 
MR. WEBSTER IS ASSUMING NOT YOU'RE ASSUMING YES 
I'M NOT ONLY ASSUMING AND I'M ASSUMING IT BASED ON DOCUMENTS 
SEE I DON'T AGREE WITH MR. WEBSTER'S ASSESSMENT OF THOSE DOCUMENTS 
ACCORDING TO THE FAMILY THEY HAD THE BOOK THE DAY OF PUBLICATION 
SOMEHOW ON THAT DAY THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THAT MASSIVE DOCUMENT IN ONE DAY ACCORDING TO THEM 
IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE TIME THOUGH THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES 
RIGHT 
IF SOMEONE WERE INFORMING FOR THE F. B. I. WHAT'S TERRIBLE 
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED THAT WAS AN AMERICAN ORGANIZATION 
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING PARTICULARLY TERRIBLE ABOUT IT 
RONALD REAGAN DID IT 
IT WAS DISCLOSED FIVE YEARS AGO THAT HE DID IT 
HIS CODE NAME WAS DISCLOSED 
I FRANKLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE FAMILY'S INCREDIBLY HARSH REACTION TO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A PROVEN FACT 
BUT YOU'RE CALLING IT A DARK PRINCE ASPECT 
WHAT IS BAD ABOUT INFORMING TO THE F. B. I. 
NOTHING IS ESSENTIALLY BAD ABOUT IT ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WALT DISNEY INFORMED UPON WERE NOT NECESSARILY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR THE ACTIONS THAT THEY DID 
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY IT OUT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE MARRED 
WELL EXCEPT THAT DISNEY'S TESTIMONY AT WAS VERY DAMAGING TO THE CAREERS OF THREE INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY 
AS FAR AS BEING OUT THAT MAKES IT WORSE IN THE SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING ACCUSED AND THEN VILIFIED CAN'T FACE THEIR ACCUSERS 
BY THE WAY THE FAMILY OF WALT DISNEY DECLINED TO APPEAR ON LARRY KING LIVE BUT WALT DISNEY'S DAUGHTER SUBMITTED THIS STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO YOUR BOOK 
YES SIR 
AND THEN I'LL HAVE YOU COMMENT 
MY FAMILY AND I HAVE NEVER SET OUT TO MY FATHER 
CERTAINLY HE WAS NOT PERFECT NO ONE IS 
THE REPUTATION HE ENJOYS AND DESERVES IS ONE HE EARNED DURING HIS LIFETIME OF HARD WORK AND HONESTY 
HE WAS A VERY GOOD MAN 
JUST AS MR. ELIOT HAS ALTERED THE MEANING OF F. B. I. DOCUMENTS TO SUIT HIS THEORIES HE ALSO HAS DELIBERATELY AND ERRONEOUSLY PORTRAYED MY FATHER'S CHARACTER IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT 
MR. ELIOT NEVER KNEW MY FATHER 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS INTENDED THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE LICENSE TO DISTORT AND DEFAME THE LIVES AND OF HONORABLE PEOPLE 
THE LETTER FROM DIANE DISNEY MILLER 
WELL THAT'S QUITE A STATEMENT 
FIRST OF ALL IF YOU FOLLOW THAT THEN NOBODY CAN WRITE A BIOGRAPHY ABOUT ANY HISTORICAL FIGURE THEY HAVEN'T MET 
THAT'S KIND OF A BIT SILLY 
THERE'S A NEW BIOGRAPHY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON OUT 
I GUESS THAT ACCORDING TO THAT DEFINITION SHOULDN'T BE LOOKED AT 
SECONDLY I'M STILL WAITING TO FACE MY ACCUSERS IN THIS SITUATION 
THE DISNEY FAMILY KEEPS ON ISSUING THESE PRONOUNCING STATEMENTS WITHOUT FACING ME ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS TO SPECIFICALLY TELL ME WHAT THEY'RE OBJECTING TO 
THIS IDEA THAT I HAVE ALTERED THE F. B. I. DOCUMENTS IS SHEER NONSENSE 
STRANGELY ENOUGH NOBODY HAS ASKED ME TO PRODUCE ANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS 
MR. WEBSTER CERTAINLY HAS ALL FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY PAGES THAT HE APPARENTLY LOOKED AT IN ONE DAY AND HASN'T FELT THE NEED TO RELEASE ANYTHING 
I AM GOING TO RELEASE THIS WEEK I WILL TELL YOU NOW AND I AM SAYING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PUBLIC 
VOLUNTARILY ON MY OWN I AM GOING TO RELEASE TEN PAGES OF THIS F. B. I. FILE THAT I HAVE 
AND IN THOSE TEN PAGES IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT WALT DISNEY WAS AN SAC CONTACT THAT HE KNEW ABOUT IT THAT HE RECEIVED LETTERS OF COMMENDATION FOR HIS WORK THAT HE TURNED IN AT LEAST ONE WORKER IN HIS STUDIO 
HE INVITED OR ALLOWED THE F. B. I. TO COME IN AND LOOK AT THE EMPLOYMENT FILES OF AN ART DIRECTOR WHO WAS LATER BY THE F. B. I. 
I WILL RELEASE THESE FILES AND THEN I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE RESPONSE IS 
BUT THERE WAS A WAVE THEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA OF FEAR AND ANTI COMMUNIST ZEALOTRY 
WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT 
SO WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE WRONG 
I MEAN HE MAY HAVE BEEN MISGUIDED BUT WHAT WAS HE DOING THAT WAS EVIL IF HE DID THAT 
I'M NOT JUDGING THE GOODNESS OR THE EVIL OF IT 
BUT YOU CALL IT DARK PRINCE 
THE REASON I CALL THE BOOK THE DARK PRINCE IS BECAUSE DISNEY'S DARK PERSONAL SIDE IS ONE OF THE AFFECTING QUALITIES OF HIS MOVIES 
THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT WALT DISNEY AND THE F. B. I. PER SE 
THAT IS ONE FACTOR OF THIS BOOK 
ALL RIGHT LET'S TOUCH ANOTHER FACTOR 
O. K. 

WELL I'M NOT THE FIRST BY FAR TO TALK ABOUT WALT DISNEY'S 
THIS HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT BEFORE 
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT HISTORY ITSELF FILM HISTORY I'M A FILM STUDENT 
I ATTENDED COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S FILM SCHOOL AND DID WORK AT THE DOCTORAL LEVEL IN FILM CRITICISM 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FILM THE THREE LITTLE PIGS THE ORIGINAL VERSION HAD A SCENE WHERE THE WOLF DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A JEWISH AND CAME TO THE DOOR AND TRIED TO WORM HIS WAY INTO ONE OF THE HOUSE 
THIS SCENE SO UPSET THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN HOLLYWOOD THAT THEY PRESSURED WALT DISNEY INTO REMOVING IT 
AND WHEN IT WAS REMOVED HE JOKINGLY SAID THAT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE FUN OF CARL WHO WAS AN ENEMY OF HIS IN HOLLYWOOD 
WHY DID HONOR HIM WITH A DINNER 
THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO WALT DISNEY'S INCREDIBLE P. R. MACHINE AND PERSONAL CHARM AND HIS ABILITY TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THAT OWN DARK SIDE 
WELL WHY WOULD AN GO TO A DINNER WHICH JEWS ARE ATTENDING TO HONOR HIM 
BECAUSE JEWS TO USE A PHRASE IN WALT DISNEY'S TIME CONTROLLED HOLLYWOOD AND HE WAS FOREVER SEEKING PART OF HIS INNER CONFLICT MUCH AS IT WAS IN HIS OWN FAMILY HE HAD A VERY VERY HOSTILE AND VIOLENT FATHER AND YET HE IDENTIFIED VERY MUCH WITH THAT FATHER WHEN HE BECAME A FATHER FIGURE IN HIS STUDIO 
HE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY IN HOLLYWOOD 
HE FELT AN OUTSIDER TO THESE EUROPEAN JEWISH MOGULS AND AT THE SAME TIME HE DESPERATELY WANTED TO BE A PART OF THAT COMMUNITY 
THE BOOK IS WALT DISNEY HOLLYWOOD'S DARK PRINCE FROM BIRCH LANE PRESS 
THE GUEST IS ITS AUTHOR MARC ELIOT 
AND HE'S GOING TO RELEASE TEN PAGES OF THE F. B. I. DOCUMENTS THIS WEEK 
AND WE'LL BE BACK AFTER THESE WORDS 
LET'S TAKE SOME CALLS FOR MARC ELIOT 
GLENDALE CALIFORNIA HELLO 
HELLO MR. ELIOT 
YES SIR 
I'VE WORKED FOR THE WALT DISNEY FAMILY FOR THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
IN THE L. A. TIMES YOU WERE QUOTED TO SAY THAT THE DISNEY FAMILY HAD A COPY OF THE BOOK AT EVERY STAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL TO THE END AND NEVER ONCE DID THEY COME FORTH AND SAY THIS IS WRONG OR THAT'S WRONG 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU STAND BY THAT STATEMENT 
I'LL TELL YOU WHY I STAND BY THAT STATEMENT 
WHEN I FIRST DID MY PROPOSAL FOR THIS BOOK I WROTE IT IN CONFIDENCE 
I GAVE IT TO MY AGENT 
IT WAS HAND DELIVERED TO MY PUBLISHER SO THAT IT WAS NEVER OUT OF SIGHT OF ANYBODY'S HANDS THAT WE KNEW OF 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE DISNEY STUDIO SAYING THAT THEY WERE NOT HAPPY THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WRITE THIS BOOK THIS WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO HOWEVER IF I WORKED WITH THEM AND ALLOWED THEM TO HELP ME THEN THEY WOULD COOPERATE 
AND WHEN I RELOCATED TO LOS ANGELES FROM NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NEAR THE STUDIO SO I COULD WORK THERE EVERY DAY I WAS TOLD THE FIRST DAY ON THE LOT THAT UNLESS I AGREED TO HAVE THEM LICENSE THE BOOK AND HAVE FINAL EDITORIAL CONTROL THAT I WOULD BE ESCORTED OFF THE LOT IMMEDIATELY AND NOT ALLOWED BACK ON AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
YOU WERE ESCORTED OFF 
THAT'S RIGHT POLITELY BUT FIRMLY 
THE DARK SIDE DEALS WITH LOSS RIGHT 
HE HAD A TERRIBLE LOSS EARLY ON 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WELL HE WAS THE CHILD OF A VERY VIOLENT FUNDAMENTALIST FATHER WHO HAD HIS OWN DARK SIDE 
AND I GUESS IN SOME WAYS LIKE FATHER LIKE SON 
WALT WENT THROUGH A VERY VERY PHYSICALLY VIOLENT AND ABUSIVE CHILDHOOD AND THIS IS KIND OF ECHOED IN THE MOVIES AND ONE OF THE YOU SEE I CALL WALT DISNEY AN ARTIST OF THE FIRST RANK AND A GENIUS IN THIS BOOK AND ONE OF THE REASONS I SAY THAT IS IN SPITE OF HIS OWN DENIALS OF ANY PSYCHOLOGICAL LINKS BETWEEN HIMSELF HIS PERSONALITY HIS BACKGROUND AND THE MOVIES THE VERY FACT OF THAT DENIAL LEAVES A WIDE OPEN PATH FOR HIM TO MAKE THE ASSOCIATIONS AS AN ARTIST 
BUT THIS ARCH RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVE MADE THE MOST ANTI N. R. A. FILM EVERY MADE 
THE N. R. A. HAS GOT TO PICKET 
I MEAN THAT TURNED OFF MORE PEOPLE FROM WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF LOSS OF PARENT 
A LOSS OF PARENTS AND A CHILD'S DESIRE TO REUNITE WITH PARENTS AND A CHILD TO HAVE A FATHER FIGURE AND A MOTHER FIGURE THAT COULD MAKE THAT CHILD FEEL SECURE AND LOVED 
PENNSYLVANIA HELLO 
HELLO 
I'M JUST CALLING TO SAY THAT I FEEL THAT WALT DISNEY HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL FOR OUR YOUNGER GENERATIONS 
AND WHEN YOU THINK WHAT IS ON TELEVISION TODAY IT'S PRETTY SICK 
AND TO HAVE EVEN SNOW WHITE COME BACK AND AND I WISH AGAIN WHICH I LOVED EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN MARVELOUS 
AND I THINK ALL CHILDREN CAN GROW UP WITH THEM 
I GREW UP WITH THEM 
I MEAN I'M 
ALL RIGHT WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION 
MY QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU SO 
WHY DEFAME A MAN WHO'S BROUGHT SO MUCH HAPPINESS TO SO MANY PEOPLE I GUESS IS IT 
AGAIN I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M ANYBODY 
I FEEL I'M TELLING A STORY THAT HAS HAPPENED 
I'M RELATING IT 
I AM THE MESSENGER NOT THE MESSAGE IN THIS BOOK 
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE MOVIES ARE AMONG THE GREATEST FILMS ANIMATED OR OTHERWISE IN HOLLYWOOD'S HISTORY 
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A FOOTNOTE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU SAID 
YOU KNOW WHEN SNOW WHITE CAME OUT IT WAS BANNED IN ENGLAND FOR BEING FOR CHILDREN 
ONE OF THE QUOTES I HAVE IN THE BOOK BY WALT DISNEY WHICH HAS BEEN OFTEN REPEATED IS THAT I DON'T MAKE FILMS PRIMARILY FOR CHILDREN 
IT'S A FASCINATING STATEMENT AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I EXPLORE IN THIS BOOK IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE WAS MAKING THESE FILMS 
I DON'T THINK IT WILL HURT BY THE WAY TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THESE MOVIES 
I DON'T THINK THAT HURTS AN ARTIST'S WORK TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE 
AUSTIN TEXAS HELLO 
YES I HAD READ IN A PREVIOUS BIOGRAPHY THAT MR. DISNEY BECAME FASCINATED WITH AND IT IMPLIED THERE WAS AND THIS IS OF COURSE A LONGSTANDING RUMOR THAT HE HAD BEEN FROZEN FOR LATER REVIVAL 
ANY INFORMATION ON THAT 
WALT DISNEY WAS AND HIS REMAINS WERE BURIED IN FOREST LAWN ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM THE STUDIO 
BACK WITH OUR REMAINING MOMENTS WITH MARC ELIOT ON LARRY KING LIVE 
TOMORROW NIGHT PRESIDENT CLINTON 
DON'T GO AWAY 
WE CAN GET IN ANOTHER CALL 
LOS ANGELES HELLO 
HI 
GREAT BOOK 
WHAT IS THE STORY ON HOW HE TREATED HIS BROTHER 
I UNDERSTAND HE DID HIM OUT OF THE BUSINESS AND OUT OF HIS WILL 
WELL I DON'T THINK HE WAS THAT SEVERE 
THERE WAS A LIFELONG SIBLING RIVALRY THERE AND HE DID KIND OF TAKE HIS BROTHER'S NAME OFF THE STUDIO 
ORIGINALLY IT WAS 
THIS IS ROY 
ROY DISNEY 
ORIGINALLY IT WAS THE DISNEY BROTHERS STUDIO CHANGED TO THE WALT DISNEY STUDIO 
ROY NEVER KNOCKED HIS BROTHER DID HE 
NO ROY NEVER FELL INTO THAT BAIT TRAP 
HE WAS VERY CONTENT TO BE BEHIND THE SCENES AND RUN THE FINANCIAL END AND TO LEAVE THE CREATIVE END TO WALT WHICH WAS PROBABLY A VERY WISE DECISION 
ARE YOU SHOCKED AT ALL THE ATTENTION THIS IS GETTING 
YES
