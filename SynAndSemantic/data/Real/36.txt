FIVE AND ONE QUARTER BILLION PEOPLE LIVE ON THIS PLANET 
THAT NUMBER COULD TRIPLE BY THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT CENTURY IF THE POPULATION BOOM IS NOT CONTROLLED ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
IN OUR SPECIAL SERIES ON THE PEOPLE BOMB C. N. N.'S LARRY LAMOTTE EXAMINES ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION 
IT COMES FROM A PLACE OF EXTREMES CALLED 
THIS IS INDIA'S SURPRISE 
PEOPLE HERE CALL IT THE LAND OF GREEN MAGIC 
ON THE SOUTHWEST TIP OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING COUNTRIES 
BUT THE MAGIC IS NOT JUST THE BEAUTY RATHER THE DRAMATIC DROP IN FAMILY SIZE 
CONSIDER THIS 
SRI WAS MARRIED AT AGE EIGHTEEN CAN READ AND WRITE HAS TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS AND IS STERILIZED 
I BELIEVE MY CHILDREN SHOULD BE FED AND EDUCATED 
IF WE HAD MORE CHILDREN HOW WOULD WE DO THAT 
ACCEPTED THINKING BY WESTERN STANDARDS ASTONISHING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUT THE PEOPLE OF HAVE STUNNED THE WORLD ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS 

LOWEST IN INDIA COMPARABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
INFANT DEATHS 
IN THE COUNTRY 
LIFE EXPECTANCY 
THE HIGHEST 
AND THE ONLY STATE IN INDIA WHERE WOMEN OUTNUMBER MEN 
ALL THIS IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S POOREST REGIONS PROVING TO SOME IT DOESN'T TAKE A LARGE TREASURY CHEST TO CONTROL THE POPULATION 
THESE ARE LESSONS CAN BE TRANSPLANTED AND USED EVERYWHERE 
BUT THERE IS A DARK SIDE 
INDIA'S HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT THE HIGHEST SUICIDE RATE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
AND THAT'S CONFUSED OBSERVERS TRYING TO DETERMINE IF SUCCESS WITH POPULATION CONTROL CAN BE EXPORTED 
DEFINITELY THERE IS A DOWN SIDE TO AND THAT HAS NOW BECOME A MAJOR QUESTION IN THE EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES 
SUCCESS IS DUE TO ITS HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POPULATION CONTROL A COMPLETE MENU THAT HAS DRAMATICALLY SLOWED THE 
A MENU THAT INCLUDES A COMMITMENT TO READING AND WRITING AND IT'S NOT JUST THE MEN WHO HAVE THE EDUCATION 
MOST OF THE GIRLS GO THROUGH ALL OF THE GRADES HERE 
UNLIKE THE REST OF INDIA WHERE ONLY ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE WOMEN ARE LITERATE 
AND THE FIGHT AGAINST OVER POPULATION I WOULD PLACE LITERACY FEMALE LITERACY AS THE NUMBER ONE IT IS THE MOST ENDURING CONTRACEPTIVE FOR THE THIRD WORLD 
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
IT'S BECAUSE YOU FIND THAT THE MOMENT YOU A WOMAN'S MIND SHE TAKES DECISIONS ON HER OWN BEHALF 
AND SHE TAKES THE RIGHT DECISIONS 
SRI HAS HAD TEN YEARS OF EDUCATION 
HER HUSBAND A CONSTRUCTION WORKER NINE 
BUT WITH VERY LITTLE INCOME THEY TALKED OVER WHAT THEY HAD READ ABOUT FAMILY PLANNING AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR SECOND CHILD 
BECAUSE OF EDUCATION WE CAME TO THINK THAT IF WE HAVE MORE CHILDREN IT WILL BE ECONOMICALLY DIFFICULT TO RAISE THEM 
GOOD HEALTH CARE WAS ANOTHER BIG FACTOR IN THE FAMILY'S DECISION 
I'M NOT AFRAID THEY WILL DIE 
THEY HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THE VACCINATION INJECTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND THERE ARE HOSPITALS AROUND IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE KIDS 
HAS PROVEN THAT WHEN FEWER CHILDREN DIE FAMILIES ARE SMALLER 
HEALTH CLINICS ARE SPREAD ACROSS AND WITH A GOOD SYSTEM OF ROADS RURAL AREAS ARE SERVED AS EFFECTIVELY AS URBAN 
STATE OWNED FOOD STORES TRY TO ASSURE GOOD HEALTH BY SUPPLYING BASIC FOOD ITEMS FOR THE POOR AT LOW COST 
AND IN THE SCHOOLS THE NEEDY GET A FREE HOT LUNCH 
FOCUS ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION IS HISTORICAL 
DATING BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WHEN CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES TAUGHT IN THE CASTE SYSTEM HOW TO READ AND WRITE AND KIND RULERS BUILT SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES COMMUNISTS CAME TO POWER TEACHING THE PEOPLE HOW TO ORGANIZE 
THEY DEMANDED HIGHER WAGES AND BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS SOME SECURITY OF EMPLOYMENT 
SO THESE ARE THE WAYS THE COMMUNIST PARTY BEGAN THE ORGANIZATION OF LABOR IN THIS STATE 
THE COMMUNISTS ALSO ALLOWED MORE PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN LAND PRODUCING A FEELING OF SECURITY 
THE PARTY LOST THE ELECTION IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE BUT REMAINS A POWERFUL FORCE STILL ORGANIZING STILL DEMONSTRATING 
AND THOUGH ITS CHANCE RESOUNDS STRONGLY THROUGH THE WORKING CLASS THE SAME COMMUNIST SYSTEM CREDITED WITH ADVANCING FAMILY PLANNING IS ALSO BLAMED FOR CONTRIBUTING TO DARK SIDE 
THE ECONOMIC FRONT IS APPALLING 
THAT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN INDIA 
I HAVE A STUDY ON THE HEALTH STATUS OF WHICH SHOWS THAT THE MORTALITY RATE HAS COME DOWN BUT THE MORBIDITY OR THE SICKNESS HAS GONE UP 
THERE ARE NOW VICTIMS OF DISEASES LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES HEART ATTACKS AND HIGH RATE OF SUICIDES MENTAL TENSION SO THIS DOES NOT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE 
THE EXTREMES OF SUCCESSES AND FAILURES HAVE SPARKED DEBATE 
IF INDIA BECOMES GOD SAVE US 
IT WILL BE A DISASTER 
IF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN THE THIRD WORLD IN AFRICA GIVE IMPORTANCE TO FEMALE IMPORTANCE AS DID AND WOULD REALLY GO FULL INTO IT OBVIOUSLY YES IT IS A SUCCESS STORY WHICH CAN BE EXPORTED AND TRANSPLANTED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD 
THE CHALLENGE FOR THE WORLD IS HOW TO COPY FAMILY PLANNING SUCCESS WHILE AVOIDING THE ECONOMIC PITFALLS
