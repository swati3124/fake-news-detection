TODAY ON THE INTERNATIONAL HOUR WE BEGIN A SPECIAL WEEKLY SEGMENT A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOCUSING ON THE U. S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND HOW THEY FEEL THE U. S. SHOULD FIT INTO A CHANGING WORLD 
WE BEGIN WITH CHINA A BILLION PEOPLE AN EMERGING TRADING POWER HOUSE AND ARMS EXPORTER 
TODAY THE U. S. SENATE UPHELD PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO OF A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE IMPOSED CONDITIONS ON THE RENEWAL OF CHINA'S TRADING STATUS WITH THE UNITED STATES 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS HAVE LONG BEEN AT ODDS OVER CHINA POLICY 
IT'S AN ISSUE ALSO THAT REVEALS SHARP CONTRASTS BETWEEN GEORGE BUSH AND BILL CLINTON 
WORLD AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT RALPH BEGLEITER REPORTS 
THE FLAMES AND TANKS OF CHINA'S TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE AND THE SETBACK FOR CHINA'S PRO DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT ARE STILL REFLECTED IN THE U. S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
WHEN CHINA CRACKED DOWN ON PRO DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS EXPORTED ADVANCED WEAPONS TO RADICAL REGIMES AND SUPPRESSED TIBET THIS ADMINISTRATION AND ITS PRESIDENT FAILED TO STAND UP FOR OUR VALUES 
INSTEAD HE SENT SECRET TO CHINA SIGNALING THAT WE WOULD DO BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH THOSE WHO MURDERED FREEDOM IN TIANANMEN SQUARE 
BUSH WHO WAS ONCE U. S. ENVOY TO BEIJING HAS PERSONALLY STEERED U. S. POLICY TOWARD CHINA SENDING HIGH LEVEL AIDES TO BEIJING AFTER TIANANMEN SQUARE SELLING SPACE SATELLITES TO CHINA AND REFUSING TO CUT OFF OR LIMIT FAVORABLE TRADE TARIFFS 
IT IS RIGHT TO EXPORT THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY TO CHINA 
IT IS WRONG TO ISOLATE CHINA IF WE HOPE TO INFLUENCE CHINA 
THE REAL POINT IS TO PURSUE A POLICY THAT HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF CHANGING CHINESE BEHAVIOR 
BUSH ARGUES THAT SOME CONTINUING SANCTIONS COUPLED WITH HIS POLICY OF STAYING ENGAGED HAVE MOVED CHINA TO COOPERATE WITH THE U. S. CHINA DIDN'T USE ITS U. N. VETO TO BLOCK LAST YEAR'S WAR AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN 
CHINA HAS PROMISED TO LIMIT EXPORTS OF PRODUCTS MADE BY PRISON LABOR AND HAS PROMISED TO STOP PIRATING U. S. COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
CHINA HAS PROMISED TO LIMIT SALES OF BALLISTIC MISSILES AROUND THE WORLD 
BUT CLINTON INDICATES HE WOULD USE THE CARROTS AND STICKS OF THE U. S. MARKET TO PRESSURE CHINA ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
CLINTON BACKS LEGISLATION LINKING FAVORABLE TARIFFS TO CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO OVERRIDE BUSH'S VETO OF THAT 
CLINTON SAYS CHINA STILL ABUSES PRO DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES STILL SELLS NUCLEAR AND WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY TO NORTH KOREA SYRIA AND IRAN AND STILL IMPOSES REPRESSIVE RULE ON TIBET 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S APPROACH TO CHINA HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF RACIST SOUTH AFRICA KEEP WORKING WITH THEM TO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES 
MR. CLINTON'S APPROACH LEANS TOWARD A TOUGHER LINE LIKE THE ECONOMIC ISOLATION WHICH ULTIMATELY PUSHED SOUTH AFRICA TOWARD CHANGE
