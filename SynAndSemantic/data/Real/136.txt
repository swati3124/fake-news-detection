LIVE FROM WASHINGTON CROSSFIRE 
ON THE LEFT MIKE KINSLEY 
ON THE RIGHT PAT BUCHANAN 
TONIGHT TAX DAY 
IN THE CROSSFIRE RICHARD FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR THE U. S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND MAX OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE 
WELCOME TO CROSSFIRE AND HAPPY APRIL FIFTEENTH INCOME TAX DAY 
NO FUN FOR ANY AMERICAN AND ESPECIALLY NO FUN THIS YEAR FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON WHO WAS FORCED TO START THE DAY BY DENYING THAT HE HAS DECIDED TO PROPOSE A NEW NATIONAL SALES TAX TO FINANCE HIS HEALTH CARE REFORM PLAN 
I DIDN'T CHANGE MY MIND 
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT YET 
BUT YESTERDAY THREE MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION CONCEDED THAT SUCH A TAX IS AT LEAST UNDER CONSIDERATION 
THE SO CALLED VALUE ADDED TAX OR VAT IS IN EFFECT A SALES TAX 
IT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO STATE SALES TAXES 
FIFTY OTHER COUNTRIES ALREADY HAVE A VAT 
IT'S A BIG MONEY RAISER A THREE PERCENT FEDERAL VAT WOULD BRING IN ABOUT SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
ECONOMISTS HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE VAT 
ON THE ONE HAND BY TAXING SPENDING IT ENCOURAGES SAVING AND INVESTMENT WHICH WE NEED MORE OF 
ON THE OTHER HAND ITS HEAVIEST BURDEN FALLS ON THE POOR WHO MUST SPEND ALL THEIR INCOME 
SENATE MINORITY LEADER BOB DOLE DOES NOT TAKE THIS NUANCED VIEW HOWEVER 
IT COULDN'T BE WORSE TIMING 
WE'RE TRYING TO THE PRESIDENT'S TRYING TO TELL EVERYBODY WE NEED THIS STIMULUS PACKAGE AND THEN SOMEBODY DROPS A NEW TAX IDEA OUT THERE THAT'S GOT TO SCARE A LOT OF TAXPAYERS WHO ALREADY FRIGHTENED BECAUSE OF THE OTHER BIG TAX PACKAGE 
WELL PAT 
MR. YOUR GROUP PURPORTS TO REPRESENT WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS 
THIS THING WOULD HAMMER THEM DIRECTLY 
IT WOULD COME RIGHT ON TOP OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX INCREASE 
IT WOULD COME ON TOP OF THE ENERGY TAX INCREASE AND MAYBE SIN TAXES 
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY SUPPORTING A GIGANTIC NEW TAX LIKE THIS 
WELL A COUPLE OF CORRECTIONS 
THE SOCIAL SECURITY INCREASE AFFECTS THE TOP TWENTY PERCENT OF RECIPIENTS OF BENEFITS WHICH 
NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING SOCIAL SECURITY TAX AT ALL 
IT'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
O. K. LET'S CALL IT THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS RICH 
WELL THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS NOT RICH 
PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION ARE NOT LIVING OFF THEIR INCOME 
THEY'RE DIS SAVING THEY'RE DRAWING DOWN ASSETS SO THEIR INCOME DOES NOT REFLECT THEIR CONSUMPTION BUT TO GET BACK TO THE MAIN QUESTION THE VALUE ADDED TAX IS ABOUT GIVING AND GETTING 
A TAX MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PAYING SOMETHING BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING SOMETHING IN RETURN 
IF THEY'RE UNINSURED THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH IS WORTH A GREAT DEAL 
SUPPOSE A WORKING CLASS GUY 
IF THEY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THEY COULD SAVE MONEY ON PREMIUMS AND THAT WOULD ALSO DEFRAY THE COST FOR THEM OF THE VALUE ADDED TAX 
THIRDLY THE EFFECTS OF THE TAX ON LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE STEPS TO ALLEVIATE THEM FURTHER 
IN PARTICULAR INSOFAR AS THE VAT REALLY IS PICKED UP BY CONSUMERS BECAUSE IT'S INCREASED PRICES THERE'S AN AUTOMATIC OFFSET IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WHICH ARE INDEXED TO INFLATION 
SO RECIPIENTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS 
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS IS REALLY A GREAT IDEA 
I MEAN ARE YOU GOING TO HERE'S A TAX THAT IS LIKE A NATIONAL SALES TAX WHICH WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN TAUGHT HITS THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS HARDEST AND YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S A GREAT IDEA BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO EXPAND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
YOU'RE ON RECORD IN FAVOR OF THE VALUE ADDED TAX AS THE BEST CONCEIVABLE 
I'M IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL SALES TAX IF YOU GET RID OF THE INCOME TAX FOR WORKING PEOPLE 
SO WE CAN AGREE THAT THE VALUE ADDED TAX IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE WAY TO RAISE REVENUE 
SO THE QUESTION ONLY BECOMES WHAT ARE WE BUYING WITH THIS TAX 
IF YOU'RE AGAINST THE NEW TAX 
MAX WHAT I'M ASKING 
IT ONLY MEANS YOU'RE AGAINST HEALTH CARE REFORM 
IF YOU'RE AGAINST HEALTH CARE REFORM YOU'RE WAY OUT IN RIGHT FIELD 
MAX I'M ASKING YOU WHY YOU ARE PILING ON A NEW TAX THAT HITS CONSUMERS YOU'RE RIGHT WORKING MIDDLE CLASS ON TOP OF THE TAXES CLINTON IS PROPOSING AND ON TOP OF THE TAXES EVERYBODY IS PAYING ON APRIL FIFTEENTH 
THE TAXES CLINTON IS PROPOSING NICK THE MIDDLE CLASS 
THE TAXES PEOPLE ARE PAYING APRIL FIFTEENTH ARE DUE IN GREAT PART TO YOUR FRIEND GEORGE BUSH WHO DECREASED WITHHOLDING LAST YEAR AND NOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT A NICE PAYMENT APRIL FIFTEENTH THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE EXPECTED 
YOU CAN ACCUSE PAT OF MANY THINGS BUT BEING A DEFENDER OF GEORGE BUSH REALLY IS NOT ONE OF THEM 
WELL HE ENDORSED HIM 
ULTIMATELY 
OVER THIS GUY 
BUT HE ENDORSED HIM 
ALL RIGHT 
FAIR ENOUGH 
RICHARD NOBODY LIKES TAXES AND I HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WITH A VAT 
THE PROBLEM IS THIS EVERYONE AGREES THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO INSURE THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION AMERICANS THAT HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE 
HOW DO YOU IF YOU DON'T LIKE TAXES IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE VAT WHAT'S YOUR WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY 
WELL IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE FREE MARKET HAS WORKED VERY WELL IN MOST OTHER AREAS IN FACT ALL OTHER AREAS OF LIFE AND IT'S THE AREA WE HAVE MOST SOCIALIZED WHICH IS MEDICAL CARE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE NOW WE HAVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND YOU SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION WHO DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE 
WELL IF WE HAD A MORE RAPIDLY GROWING ECONOMY AND IF WE HAD DEDUCTIONS SO THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE COULD GO AHEAD AND BUY THEIR OWN MEDICAL CARE WE COULD TAKE CARE OF MUCH OF THIS PROBLEM 
LOOK HAVE DEDUCTIONS 
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT THROUGH THE DEDUCTIONS THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION HAS AN INTERESTING PLAN IN THAT REGARD BUT DEDUCTIONS COST MONEY 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY TO MAKE UP OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO LET THE DEFICIT INCREASE 
OH I CAN GET THE MONEY LOTS OF PLACES LIKE WE COULD ABOLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT 
NO I DO WANT TO DO THAT 
OH YOU DO 
GOOD 
HOW ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 
FOOD STAMPS 
NOT FOOD STAMPS 
MAYBE GET RID OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
MONEY THAT BUSINESS FIRMS SPEND ON HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEIR WORKERS ALREADY ESCAPES TAX SO THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE LACK OR PRESENCE OF A DEDUCTION 
IT'S THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE LOW INCOME AND THAT HEALTH CARE MARKETS 
WHY DON'T WE TAX THAT TOO 
WORK LEAST WELL OF ALL PRIVATE SECTOR MARKETS AND THAT'S WHY THE 
YOU'RE SURELY NOT SUGGESTING ARE YOU RICHARD THAT THE FREE MARKET ALL BY ITSELF CAN ASSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CAN HAVE HEALTH CARE AND YOU DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY WAY TO HELP PROVIDE IT 
NOBODY EVEN PAT DOESN'T THINK THAT OR DID CLAIM NOT TO THINK THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN 
OH REALLY 
ACTUALLY I LIKE A VOUCHER SYSTEM FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE 
IT COSTS MONEY DOESN'T IT A VOUCHER SYSTEM LIKE ANY OTHER SYSTEM 
THE REAL PROBLEM WITH HEALTH CARE IS WE DECIDED WE WANT TO INSURE PEOPLE FROM THE FIRST DOLLAR 
NOW MOST PEOPLE IN MOST YEARS HAVE RELATIVELY MODEST MEDICAL EXPENSES 
WHAT THEY REALLY NEED TO BE INSURED AGAINST ARE THE CATASTROPHIC MEDICAL CARE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY INCREASE IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PAYMENTS OR GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
LOOK THERE ARE PEOPLE 
WE'RE DOING IT ALL BACKWARDS 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
LOOK IT IS A QUESTION OF MATHEMATICS RICHARD 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GETTING HEALTH CARE NOW WHO ARE GOING TO NEED TO GET IT 
WE HOPE THAT BRINGING EFFICIENCIES TO THE SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE WILL ULTIMATELY LOWER THE COST FOR EVERYBODY BUT MEANWHILE IF YOU WANT TO COVER THOSE PEOPLE 
MICHAEL 
DO IT THROUGH VOUCHERS DO IT HOWEVER YOU WANT IT IS GOING TO COST MONEY 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY 
MICHAEL GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCIES IS AN OXYMORON A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS 
SO JUST DO NOTHING ABOUT IT THE WAY GEORGE BUSH AND RONALD REAGAN DID NOTHING FOR TWELVE YEARS 
DON'T DO SOMETHING STUPID IS WHAT WE'RE SAYING 
ASIDE FROM THE REVENUE COSTS OF THE TAX CREDIT THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THE FACT IS THAT IF PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BUY INSURANCE INDIVIDUALLY IN PRIVATE MARKETS THE COST TO THEM WOULD BE AND THAT'S ONE REASON SO MANY PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED 
IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE OUT IN THE PRIVATE MARKET TRYING TO BUY YOUR OWN INSURANCE AND TRY FIND OUT YOURSELF WHAT THE COST IS AND THEN FIGURE OUT THE BENEFITS OF A TAX CREDIT AND LOOK AT THE COST YOU'LL BE FACING AND YOU'LL SEE THE BASIC PROBLEM WITH THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH WHICH INCLUDES PROPOSALS TO ABOLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
IT'S NOT SERIOUS 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM YOU HAVE THIRD PARTY PAYERS 
SO THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR PICKING THE CHEAPEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND IF YOU'VE GOT GOVERNMENT OR INSURANCE COMPANIES PAYING MOST MEDICAL BILLS WHICH THEY DO NOBODY IS COST CONSCIOUS ABOUT MEDICAL CARE 
SO ABOLISH INSURANCE COMPANIES 
NO LET'S GET BACK TO VAT 
AS I SAID MOST PEOPLE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE DAY TO DAY MEDICAL COSTS 
IT IS THE CATASTROPHIC ONES WE HAVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE AGAINST AND FOR VERY LOW 
LET'S GET BACK TO VAT 
YOU CAN'T HAVE CO PAYMENTS FOR A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CATASTROPHIC 
O. K. LET'S GET BACK 
YEAH I KNOW 
THE NATURE OF INSURANCE 
RICHARD CAN WE BACK TO VAT 
LET'S GET BACK TO VAT 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS DON'T YOU THINK IF YOU TAKE AN ENERGY TAX AND ADD IT ON TO BUSINESS COSTS AND THEN YOU TAKE A VAT TAX AND ADD IT ON CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO PAY 
THE ENERGY TAX IS VERY SMALL TINY 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO GO MAKE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FAR LESS COMPETITIVE THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW BY DOING THAT 
WELL AS I SAID THE ISSUE IS ARE WE GOING TO HAVE HEALTH CARE REFORM OR NOT 
IF WE'RE GOING TO SPEND NEW MONEY ON HEALTH CARE 
WHY NOT CIGARETTE TAX 
THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE GOING TO FINANCE THIS 
AND IF YOU NEED A LOT OF MONEY FROM A BIG NEW TAX AS YOU HAVE SAID YOURSELF AMONG THE CONCEIVABLE CHOICES A VALUE ADDED TAX IS NOT A BAD TAX 
WELL I SAID A NATIONAL RETAIL SALES TAX 
RICHARD I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY YOUR POSITION HERE BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF BUSINESS LOBBYISTS OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE IN FACT YOUR FORMER BOSS AT THE COUNCIL FOR CAPITAL FORMATION CHARLIE WALKER HAS BEEN PUSHING A VALUE ADDED TAX FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS 
IT IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE EXISTING INCOME TAX AND I'M ALL FOR A VALUE ADDED TAX WHEN WE REPEAL THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION WHICH GAVE THE CONGRESS THE POWER TO IMPOSE AN INCREASE 
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT 
YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF A VALUE ADDED TAX IF IT'S USED TO REDUCE THE TAXES ON A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE AND THEIR INVESTMENTS 
YOU'RE NOT IN FAVOR OF USING A VALUE ADDED TAX IF IT'S GOING TO BE USED TO BRING HEALTH CARE FOR POOR PEOPLE 
I'M IN FAVOR OF AN EFFICIENT AND NON DESTRUCTIVE TAX SYSTEM AND RIGHT NOW THE PRESENT INCOME TAX AND I THINK MOST AMERICANS AGREE WITH ME AFTER WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH TO GET UP TO TODAY THAT THE EXISTING INCOME TAX IS EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT 
IT IMPOSES ENORMOUS PENALTIES ON PERSONAL FREEDOM AND 
COMPARED TO PAYING TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY PERCENT VAT THEY'D HAVE TO PAY TO REPLACE THE INCOME TAX 
WELL IT'S THE INTRUSIVENESS 
O. K. HAS BILL CLINTON MISREAD THE MOOD OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON TAXES IN GENERAL AND IS HE RIDING FOR A FALL 
THAT QUESTION WHEN WE COME BACK 
WELCOME BACK 
ON APRIL FIFTEENTH TAX DAY IN AMERICA THE HEADLINES TELL US THAT BILL CLINTON IS THINKING OF A BRAND NEW TAX A VAT TAX OR SORT OF A NATIONAL SALES TAX TO PAY FOR THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS WORKING UP 
ARE CLINTON AND CLINTON MISREADING THE MOOD OF AMERICA OR ARE THEIR CRITICS BEHIND THE TIMES 
OUR GUESTS ARE RICHARD FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST WITH THE U. S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND NOW PRESIDENT OF AND MAX OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE 
MAX A POLITICAL QUESTION IF I MIGHT DO YOU THINK THAT FIRST DO YOU THINK THAT CLINTON WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED IF HE HAD LAID OUT SOME OF THESE TAX IDEAS DURING THE CAMPAIGN 
AND SECONDLY GIVEN HIS OWN RESPONSE WHICH YOU SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW WHERE HE SAID WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON THAT DO YOU THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA TO DROP THIS OUT POLITICALLY 
I KNOW YOU THINK IT WAS ECONOMICALLY 
WELL CONCERNING THE VALUE ADDED TAX SENATOR KERREY DID QUITE WELL IN THE CAMPAIGN BY PROPOSING A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN WHICH WOULD BE FINANCED 
WHERE'D HE DO WELL 
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE GREAT NEW TAXES 
I DON'T KNOW THAT KERREY WAS SPECIFIC ABOUT THE TYPE OF TAX BUT I THINK THAT IN THE CAMPAIGN IF CLINTON HAD PUT FORWARD WHATEVER THEY END UP WITH IN TERMS OF A HEALTH CARE REFORM PLAN AND ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS GOING TO COST MONEY THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALREADY AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO FINANCE IT WITH A VALUE ADDED TAX I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE GONE OVER WELL BECAUSE PART OF THE ELECTION WAS ABOUT REFORM OF HEALTH CARE 
THE VALUE ADDED TAX IS GOING TO OFFSET OUT OF POCKET MEDICAL EXPENDITURES BY FAMILIES 
DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO GET IT 
DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO GET THE VALUE ADDED TAX THROUGH THIS CONGRESS 
HE'S GOT TO PROPOSE IT 
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP 
YEAH IS HE GOING TO PROPOSE IT 
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO PROPOSE IT 
WHY WOULD LET ME ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION 
WHY WOULDN'T HE DO I MEAN WOULDN'T YOU AGREE WITH A SIN TAX ON CIGARETTES 
YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH MONEY FROM A SIN TAX TO FINANCE A NEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
YOU NEED A TAX THAT HAS THE BROADEST POSSIBLE BASE AND THAT IS THE VALUE ADDED TAX 
THE CIGARETTE TAX ALCOHOL TAX THESE ARE SMALL THESE ARE NICKEL AND DIME OPERATIONS IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS 
DIDN'T HE CONTRADICT HIS BASIC PLEDGE I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR ANY OF MY 
IS HE NOT CONTRADICTING THAT 
AS I RECALL IN THE CAMPAIGN WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE REFORM THERE WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT TO PAY FOR SOME LARGE NEW PROGRAM THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE NEW TAXES AS THERE ARE 
RICHARD ISN'T IT A LITTLE UNFAIR TO PICK ON CLINTON AS A AS PAT WAS DOING 
WHEN IF YOU LOOK AT HIS BUDGET AT THE END OF THE DAY A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE ECONOMY WOULD BE GOING TO FEDERAL SPENDING UNDER CLINTON THAN WENT UNDER BUSH OR REAGAN 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YES CLINTON WOULD PAY FOR MORE OF IT INSTEAD OF BORROWING IT FROM THE FUTURE FROM THE NEXT GENERATION 
WELL MICHAEL I FIND INTERESTING IT TOOK GEORGE BUSH AT LEAST TWO YEARS TO VIOLATE HIS NO NEW TAXES' PLEDGE OR READ MY LIPS 
NOW BILL CLINTON'S DONE IT WHAT THREE TIMES IN THREE MONTHS 
HE DIDN'T SAY READ MY LIPS NO NEW TAXES 
HE SAID 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THAT 
HE WAS FORTHRIGHT ABOUT 
WHAT ABOUT ANSWERING MY QUESTION 
I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS 
CLINTON'S BUDGET PLAN CALLS FOR A SMALLER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A SHARE OF G. D. P. THAN BUSH OR REAGAN LEFT US 
NO 
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS HE WOULD PAY FOR IT AND ISN'T THAT A HEALTHY THING TO DO TO PAY FOR IT INSTEAD OF BORROWING IT 
YOUR ASSUMPTION IS TOTALLY WRONG 
IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE REAL NUMBERS YOU END UP WITH A BIGGER GOVERNMENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 
THOSE ARE YOUR NUMBERS 
THEY'RE NOT CLINTON'S NUMBERS 
WELL CLINTON DOESN'T HAVE HIS HEALTH INSURANCE IN THERE YET 
I MEAN IF YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HIS OWN SET OF PROJECTIONS YOU END UP WITH MORE DEFICIT IN IT TOOK RONALD REAGAN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS TO GIVE THE DEFICIT THAT BILL CLINTON HAS PROMISED TO GIVE US IN FOUR YEARS 
WELL NOW LOOK THAT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR 
RONALD REAGAN TOOK WHAT WAS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL AND MADE IT A HORRIFIC PROBLEM 
THE PROBLEM GETS DUMPED ON BILL CLINTON 
YOU DON'T THINK WE HAD A PROBLEM IN THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION 
YES WE HAD A PROBLEM OF SEVENTY DOLLAR BILLION DEFICITS I BELIEVE OR FIFTY DOLLAR BILLION DEFICITS WHICH RONALD REAGAN DENOUNCED AND WOULD HE HAVE LOVED TO HAVE GOTTEN BACK TO THOSE AND WOULD WE ALL 
CLINTON CUT SPENDING IN NET TERMS AND THAT CHANGED FROM THE BASELINE IN TERMS OF SPENDING MEANS LESS SPENDING AND THAT MEANS EVERY PENNY OF NEW TAXES IN THE CLINTON PROGRAM REDUCES THE DEFICIT WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SCREAMING ABOUT NOW FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS 
SO THE PROGRAM REDUCES THE DEFICIT WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRYING ABOUT 
THE CLINTON PROGRAM BY INCREASING TAXES WILL SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION 
WELL IT'S NOT A DIFFERENT QUESTION BECAUSE YOU WILL GET A BIGGER PERCENTAGE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING WILL BE A BIGGER PERCENTAGE OF G. N. P. AT THE END OF THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION THAN BEFORE IT 
HAVEN'T WE HAD A TWELVE YEAR EXPERIMENT IN SAYING CUT RICH PEOPLE'S TAXES AND WE'LL GET AND WE WON'T INCREASE THE DEFICIT 
IT WORKED 
IT WORKED 
YOU RAISED THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND REVENUES FELL 
WE HAD 
THAT'S INCORRECT 
IT IS NOT INCORRECT 
CAPITAL GAINS REVENUES FELL BECAUSE YOU CLOSED THE LOOPHOLE 
YOU HAD AN EIGHT YEAR EXPERIMENT WHICH WORKED VERY WELL 
THEN WE HAVE BEGAN TO HAVE CLINTONOMICS WHICH STARTED 
UNDER GEORGE BUSH 
UNDER GEORGE BUSH IT MOST CERTAINLY DID WE ALL KNOW THAT 
WELL CLINTON MADE 
WHAT WAS THE DEFICIT AT THE END OF THE REAGAN YEARS 
REMIND ME 
THE DEFICIT IS NOT THE IMPORTANT THING 
IT WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IT'S NOW THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS 
WHAT WAS IT AT THE END OF THE HORRIBLE JIMMY CARTER YEARS 
IT WAS EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS 
ALL RIGHT 
SO REAGAN DOUBLED IT 
THAT'S 
WELL 
THE ECONOMY'S LARGER SO THE DEFICIT ABSENT CHANGES 
YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE PROGRAM THE PROBLEM IS GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT IS NOT MATERIAL 
AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS SMALLER 
WHAT'S RELEVANT IS RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY 
IT WILL NOT GET SMALLER MICHAEL 
WELL YOU CAN SAY THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT HIS PLAN CALLS FOR IS SMALLER GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE TAXES AND HAVE MORE RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH 
THAT'S ABSURD 
LET ME 
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABSURD 
THIS IS 
WHY DO WE HAVE TAXES AT ALL 
WHY NOT CUT TAXES TO ZERO BORROW THE WHOLE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
WOULD THAT BE HEALTHY 
OR HAVE ONE PERCENT TAXES IF TAXES ARE ALWAYS BAD FOR GROWTH 
WE HAD NINETY AND SEVENTY PERCENT TOP MARGINAL TAX RATES IN THE INCOME TAX FOR TWENTY YEARS IN THE U. S. AND WE DID QUITE WELL 
SO 
BUT NOBODY ACTUALLY 
OUR MARGINAL TAX RATES ARE SO SO YOU COULDN'T POINT TO THAT RECORD 
AND THEN YOU PEOPLE AGAINST ALL THE LOOPHOLES ENABLED PEOPLE NOT TO PAY THOSE RATES 
I MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS 
WELL MAX LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION RICHARD'S ASKING 
YOU DO HAVE A I MEAN THE B. T. U. TAX IS VERY HEAVY 
IT'S TINY 
HOLD IT 
LET ME ASK THE QUESTION 
IT'S LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT OF G. N. P. 
LET ME ASK THE QUESTION MAX YOU CAN GIVE THE ANSWERS 
ALL RIGHT LET'S SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES THIRTY DOLLARS TO NINETY BILLION DOLLARS COMING OFF THIS NEW TAX HE'S PROPOSING 
OVER FIVE YEARS 
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HIT THE PRIVATE ECONOMY LIKE THAT WITH NEW TAXES AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE ENERGETIC AND PRODUCTIVE 
YES BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES WITH TAXES VERY MUCH HIGHER THAN THE UNITED STATES RELATIVE TO G. D. P. WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER WHOSE ECONOMIES HAVE DONE FAIRLY WELL NOT AS GREAT AS US IN SOME PERIODS BUT BETTER IN RECENT YEARS THAN OURS HAS THAT GIVES I THINK US A GOOD MEASURE OF CONFIDENCE THAT A SLIGHT INCREASE IN TAXES WHICH IS WHAT'S INVOLVED HERE WITH THE PRESENT PROPOSAL EVEN IF YOU INCLUDE A BIG NEW VAT A SLIGHT INCREASE OF TAXES BY THE EVIDENCE OF RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE PROMISES NO HARMFUL EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY AND MEASURED AGAINST WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR THESE TAXES WE'RE GOING TO GET HEALTH CARE REFORM WHICH IS GOING TO HELP BUSINESSES 
I'VE GOT CUT YOU OFF AND I'VE GOT TO CUT YOU OFF TOO RICHARD 
YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE 
WHEN WE COME BACK THOUGH I'M GOING TO TRY AND GET RICHARD TO CRITICIZE A FORMER EMPLOYER 
THINK I CAN DO IT 
RICHARD FOR MANY YEARS YOU WERE CHIEF ECONOMIST TO THE U. S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE LEADING BUSINESS GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY 
A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ARE VERY VERY ANNOYED AT THE CHAMBER THESE DAYS BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'RE BEING TOO NICE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON 
DO YOU SHARE THAT CRITICISM OF YOUR FORMER EMPLOYER 
YES BUT THEN LET ME GET INTO WHAT MAX SAID ABOUT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH RESULTING FROM THESE TAX INCREASES 
IS YOUR PENSION VESTED 
I HOPE SO 
NOBODY BELIEVES GROWTH RESULTS FROM TAX INCREASES 
NOBODY SAID THAT 
YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE 
LET'S TAKE EUROPE 
EUROPE HAS THE INCOME TAXES 
THEY HAVE ALL THESE WONDERFUL VALUE ADDED TAXES THAT YOU AND MICHAEL WANT TO IMPOSE ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
THEY AVERAGE TEN PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT IN EUROPE NOW 
THE GROWTH RATES HAVE BEEN VERY SLOW 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO BRING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WHAT ABOUT JAPAN 
JAPAN HAS TAXES ON INVESTMENTS OF UP TO SIXTY SIX PERCENT 
THEY DON'T HAVE A VALUE ADDED TAX 
THEY WELL I'M NOT FOR A VALUE ADDED TAX 
AND IT'S GOT THE EXEMPTION FOR SAVING AND INVESTMENT 
THEY HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR LISTED STOCKS 
THEY TAX INVESTMENTS FAR HEAVIER THAN WE DO 
THEY HAVE A MINUSCULE TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS 
NO ONLY ON LISTED STOCKS 
YOU CAN PAY SIXTY SIX PERCENT ON YOUR CAPITAL GAINS 
NO YOU PAY JUST 
LET ME GET MAX BACK INTO THE POLITICS OF THIS RICHARD 
LET ME GET MAX BACK IN HERE 
CONSIDERING THE OPPOSITION HIS STIMULUS PACKAGE IS GETTING UP ON THE HILL RIGHT NOW FROM REPUBLICANS AND THE FACT THESE ARE CONTROVERSIAL ALL THESE TAXES DO EITHER OR BOTH OF YOU THINK THAT CLINTON'S TAX PROPOSAL B. T. U. SOCIAL SECURITY ESPECIALLY CAN BE STOPPED 
AND DO YOU THINK THE VAT TAX WILL GO THROUGH 
WELL THEY COULD BE STOPPED BUT THEY COULD ALSO PASS 
THEY'RE NOT TAX PROPOSALS 
THEY'RE BUDGET PROPOSALS 
THERE'S TAXES WHICH MEANS PEOPLE PAY AND THERE'S SPENDING WHICH MEANS PEOPLE GET AND THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT JUST THE PAY SIDE BUT THE NET WHAT YOU COME OUT WITH 
IF YOU COME OUT WITH LOWER HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS OR YOU COME OUT WITH HEALTH INSURANCE WHERE YOU HAD NONE BEFORE THE VALUE ADDED TAX IS NOT A SERIOUS BURDEN 
IF WE GET DEFICIT REDUCTION WHICH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRYING FOR FOR YEARS AND INTEREST RATES GO DOWN 
IT'S GOING TO SAIL THROUGH 
BUSINESSES WILL BE HELPED 
I GATHER IT'S GOING TO SAIL THROUGH 
IT'S NOT GOING TO SAIL 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE 
WHEN HE FOCUSES ON THIS THING I THINK HE CAN RAM IT THROUGH 
RICHARD 
I'VE GOT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEW 
THERE'S ALREADY A GROUP OUT THERE THE AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM RUN BY GROVER THAT SIGNED UP ONE HUNDRED TEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALREADY ON AN ANTI VAT CAUCUS AND GIVEN THAT AND I THINK WHEN OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REALIZE THIS IS HIGHLY REGRESSIVE IT'S GOING TO HURT LOTS OF FOLKS IT'S GOING TO BE AN ADD ON TO THE EXISTING INCOME TAX THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DEFEAT THIS 
HOW CAN YOU SAY THIS IS REGRESSIVE WHEN YOU SUPPORT REPLACING THE PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAX WITH A VAT 
THAT'S RIDICULOUS 
NO IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS AT ALL 
HOW CAN YOU PRETEND TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN YOU WANT TO REPLACE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS COLLECTED IN A PROGRESSIVE FASHION WITH A SALES TAX 
YOU CAN HAVE CERTAIN CREDITS AGAINST IT TO MAKE THE TAKE AWAY A LOT OF THE 
THEY WON'T BE 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE 
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SETTLE THIS ONE OFF CAMERA 
THANKS VERY MUCH RICHARD 
THANK YOU MAX 
PAT AND I WILL TRY AND SETTLE THIS ON CAMERA IN JUST A MOMENT 
PAT LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION 
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY AGAINST A VAT AT ALL 
YOU'D LIKE A VAT IF IT WAS USED TO REPLACE A LOT OF TAXES ON THINGS LIKE CAPITAL GAINS AND INVESTMENTS OF RICH PEOPLE 
YOU'RE AGAINST A VAT IF IT'S USED TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE FOR POOR PEOPLE 
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT 
I DON'T THINK IT OUGHT TO BE ADDED ON TOP OF THE PRESENT TAXES AT ALL 
I DO THINK IT'S REGRESSIVE 
I DO THINK IF YOU THREW OUT THE INCOME THROW OUT THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX COMPLETELY AS WELL AS CAPITAL GAINS INTEREST INCOME 
SO TAKE THE AS MAX WAS SAYING GET RID OF THE PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAX AND REPLACE IT WITH THE REGRESSIVE VALUE ADDED TAX 
A VALUE ADDED TAX YOU'D EXCLUDE CERTAIN THINGS AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A FLAT TAX AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WEALTHY FOLKS SAY FIFTEEN PERCENT 
PUT THAT TOGETHER MICHAEL AND YOU GOT A PROGRAM THAT WINS AMERICA 
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAYING A LOT LESS TAX UNDER THAT AND THE ORDINARY AMERICAN IS GOING TO BE PAYING A LOT MORE AND YOU KNOW IT 
UNTRUE 
I'D BE PAYING A GOOD DEAL MORE 
I DOUBT IT 
FROM THE LEFT I'M MIKE KINSLEY 
GOOD NIGHT FOR CROSSFIRE
