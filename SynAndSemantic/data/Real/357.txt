THE U. S. MILITARY IS NO DIFFERENT THAN MUCH OF CORPORATE AMERICA IT IS DOWN SIZING 
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE KNOWN THE MILITARY THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS HAVE TO FIND JOBS NOW IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD 
C. N. N.'S BRIAN CABELL REPORTS THE MILITARY IS TRYING TO EASE THAT TRANSITION WITH JOB FAIRS 
THEY ARRIVED HERE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND STRONG MOSTLY ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEN SOME RETIRED SOME ABOUT TO RETIRE SOME CONTEMPLATING RETIREMENT ALL CONSIDERING NEW CAREERS AS CIVILIANS 
WELL TO BE HONEST IT'S SCARED 
IT REALLY IS IT'S SCARY BUT THE MILITARY AS WE ALL KNOW IS DOWN SIZING 
DOWN SIZING FROM A TOTAL FORCE SIZE OF MORE THAN TWO MILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MILLION THIS YEAR TO LESS THAN ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE ALL THE RESULT OF DEMANDS FOR GREATER AUSTERITY 
FOR THESE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED PERSONNEL NOW LOOKING AT AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THE CUTS WERE EXPECTED 
IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED CAREER ANY MORE THAT IT ONCE WAS 
THE THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE ARE A LOG OF CHANGES GOING ON WITHIN THE MILITARY ITSELF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES 
THE EXPECTATIONS ARE DIFFERENT FOR A LOT OF OFFICERS THAN WHAT THEY USED TO BE 
IS THIS WORKING FOR THE COMPANY OR WORKING FOR A FRANCHISE OWNER 
FRANCHISE 
TRANSITION FROM THE ORGANIZED EVEN LIFE OF THE MILITARY TO THE LESS STRUCTURED CIVILIAN JOB WORLD CAN BE DAUNTING 
THE MILITARY IS HELPING WITH PROGRAMS ON RESUME WRITING INTERVIEWING AND JOB SEEKING AS A WAY OF THANKING THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN AND ALSO FOR PRACTICAL REASONS 
THE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND THE SOONER THAT THEY ARE PRODUCTIVE THE BETTER IT IS FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OR WE'RE NOT SUPPORTING THEM IN SOME OTHER SOCIAL PROGRAM 
MILITARY PERSONNEL MAY LACK SOME SKILLS OF THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS BUT THE DO HAVE ADVANTAGES 
THESE EMPLOYERS KNOW THAT THESE FOLKS ARE DRUG FREE 
THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO LEARN SOME SKILLS 
THEY KNOW THEY KNOW HOW TO TAKE ORDERS THEY KNOW HOW TO GIVE ORDERS THEY TAKE A MISSION AND ACCOMPLISH IT 
THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE RESUME AND THE MISSION FOR INCREASING NUMBERS OF THEM NO LONGER SECURE IN THEIR MILITARY POSITIONS IS TO GO OUT AND FIND A NEW CIVILIAN JOB
