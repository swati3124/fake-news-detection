A CLIMACTIC MOMENT IN POLITICIAN CRISIS BROUGHT ABOUT BY FOUR DAYS OF VIOLENT PROTEST THIS WEEK 
THE COUNTRY'S UNELECTED PRIME MINISTER MAY BE ON HIS WAY OUT 
C. N. N.'S BANGKOK BUREAU CHIEF TOM MINTIER 
THE BIGGEST QUESTION IN BANGKOK THAILAND ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IS WHO IS RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT 
THERE HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS FLED THE COUNTRY 
UNDER FIRE FROM ALL SIDES EVEN THOSE WHO SELECTED HIM THE FIVE POLITICAL PARTIES THAT FORMED A COALITION THAT MADE THIS GOVERNMENT AND APPOINTED HIM PRIME MINISTER WITHDREW THEIR SUPPORT OVER THE WEEKEND 
IT NOW APPEARS THAT MAY HAVE FLED THE COUNTRY POSSIBLY ABOARD A MILITARY C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TO AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT MAY HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY THERE ARE STILL DEMONSTRATORS IN THE STREET MOURNING THE LOSS OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED IN NEARLY A WEEK OF RIOTING 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO OFFICIAL THAT HAS RESIGNED HIS POST IN THE GOVERNMENT ONLY SIGHTINGS OF HIM OVER AND AROUND THE TOWN AND POSSIBLY AT THE AIRPORT BOARDING A PLANE 
THERE WERE SEVERAL COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS GOING TO EUROPE AND REPORTS THAT HE WOULD BE SEEKING ASYLUM POSSIBLY IN NORWAY SWEDEN FRANCE OR EVEN TAIWAN BUT NO GOVERNMENT CONFIRMATION THROUGH THE EMBASSIES IN BANGKOK WAS POSSIBLE 
THERE ARE ALSO PICTURES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN BY MOST BEFORE 
GOVERNMENT TELEVISION LATE SATURDAY NIGHT STARTED TO SHOW SOME OF THE PICTURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT PREVENTED THEM FROM SEEING 
IT SHOWS THE SOLDIERS WITH THEIR WEAPONS FIRING INTO THE AIR AND INTO THE CROWD SOMETHING MANY PEOPLE FOUND OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON SATURDAY 
SO THE QUESTION REMAINS WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THE GOVERNMENT 
IF HAS FLED THE COUNTRY WHO MAY BE NEXT
