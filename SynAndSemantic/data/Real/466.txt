THE FUTURE WENT ON SALE MONDAY IN WASHINGTON 
IT WAS CALLED THE LARGEST SALE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY EVER 
THE PROPERTY SOLD WAS AIR WAVES AND THE FUTURE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS MAY BE IN THE BALANCE 
IRV CHAPMAN REPORTS ON THE COMPUTERIZED ACTION 
A SIZED TELEPHONE OF THE NEAR FUTURE VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE DISPLAYED IT AS HE KICKED OFF AN AUCTION OF RADIO FREQUENCIES TO SERVE SUCH PORTABLE PHONES 
NOW WE'RE USING THE AUCTIONS TO PUT LICENSES IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO VALUE THEM THE MOST 
BIDDING COULD TAKE MONTHS AND END UP PUTTING AS MUCH AS NINE BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE FEDERAL TREASURY 
LET THE AUCTIONS BEGIN 
A FEW USED COMPUTERS INSTALLED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
OTHERS BID FROM THEIR OWN HEADQUARTERS 
IN THIS FIRST DAY PARTICIPANTS OFFERED UP LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BIDS THE HIGHEST INCLUDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEW YORK AREA THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
PACIFIC BELL EXPECTS TO WIN LICENSES IN CALIFORNIA 
WE EXPECT OTHER TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME DISCOURAGED WHEN THEY SEE HOW DETERMINED WE ARE 
THE COMPANIES INVOLVED HAVE TOTAL ASSETS OF THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS 
ANALYSTS SAY THAT'S WHY CAN EASILY AFFORD THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN EXPENSIVE NEW SYSTEMS EVEN IF THE POTENTIALLY HUGE MARKET IS A LONG TIME IN COMING 
WE PLAN ON BIDDING AGGRESSIVELY BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO FOR THESE LICENSES 
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET CAUGHT IN A BIDDING FRENZY 
COMPETING P. C. S. SERVICES WOULD SERVE EACH METROPOLITAN AREA SIDE BY SIDE WITH CELLULAR AND WIRED PHONES 
THE GOALS ARE BOTH TO PROVIDE THESE NEW GO ANYWHERE TELEPHONES AND TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF ALL TELEPHONE SERVICES THANKS TO EXTRA COMPETITION

IN AN INTERESTING TO THAT STORY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION SHUNNED THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY DURING ITS AUCTIONS 
BECAUSE OF THE RECENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED BUG IN INTEL'S PENTIUM THE F. C. C. DECIDED NOT TO USE ITS PENTIUM EQUIPPED COMPUTERS DURING THE AUCTION MONDAY
