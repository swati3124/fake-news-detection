THE UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON D. C. OPENS TO THE PUBLIC NEXT WEEK 
THE MUSEUM WILL BE DEDICATED TOMORROW BY PRESIDENT CLINTON 
IT'S THE RESULT OF MORE THAN A DECADE OF PLANNING AND FUND RAISING 
IT WAS BUILT WITH ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTED A PLOT OF LAND JUST OFF THE MALL NEXT TO THE MINT 
THE MALL IS AMERICA'S ROMAN FORUM STILL STANDING A NATIONAL COMMONS RINGED BY MARBLE MUSEUMS AND MONUMENTS THE CAPITOL BUILDING THE NATIONAL GALLERY THE AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM 
THESE ARE PLACES AMERICANS CHOOSE TO FOR WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED OR ACQUIRED 
AMONG THEM A HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IS A STRANGE NEW NEIGHBOR 
IT'S DEVOTED TO A EUROPEAN EVENT NAZI GERMANY'S GENOCIDAL CRUSADE AGAINST THE JEWS 
WHETHER SUCH A MUSEUM CAN JUSTIFY ITS PLACE IN THE CIVIC CENTER OF OUR COUNTRY THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE GHETTOS AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS OF EUROPE WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT TROUBLED HISTORIANS SUCH AS JERRY MULLER OF THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA 
WE ASKED PROFESSOR MULLER TO BE OUR REVIEWER TO GUIDE US THROUGH THE MUSEUM 
HE ENTERED HARBORING OTHER QUESTIONS 
HOW DO YOU PRESENT THE HISTORY OF THE HOLOCAUST TO A MASS AUDIENCE OF VISITORS 
AND HOW DO YOU DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS HISTORICALLY RESPONSIBLE THAT IS THAT CONVEYS THE SPECIFICITY OF WHAT WENT ON AND NOT GET LOST IN SORT OF GENERAL ABOUT THE EVILS OF PREJUDICE WHICH AFTER ALL IS A UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON OR THE VIRTUES OF TOLERANCE WHICH IS A VIRTUE BUT ALSO HAS ITS LIMITS 
SOMETIMES IT LEADS US TO TOLERATE THINGS WE OUGHT NOT TO TOLERATE 
SO IN OTHER WORDS HOW DO YOU CONVEY WHAT'S HISTORICALLY SPECIFIC ABOUT THIS TO A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE 
HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO TOUCH THEM 
THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IS NOT A RE CREATION BUT IT IS A HISTORY EXHIBIT THAT USES EVERY MEDIUM POSSIBLE ARCHITECTURE SOUND PHOTOGRAPHY EVEN SO CALLED IDENTITY CARDS OF REAL VICTIMS 
IT FOLLOWS THE PROCESS OF GENOCIDE FROM THE CHAOS AND DESPAIR OF GERMAN POLITICS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES TO THE GAS CHAMBERS AND OF THE WORLD WAR TWO DEATH CAMPS 
AT THE START A SHORT DOCUMENTARY FILM TELLS THE STORY OF THE RISE OF NATIONAL SOCIALISM IN THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC THE PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY THAT FOLLOWED IMPERIAL GERMANY'S DEFEAT IN WORLD WAR ONE 
ITS CLIMAX COMES AFTER THE ELECTION OF NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WHEN GERMAN PRESIDENT VON THE HEAD OF STATE NAMED ADOLF HITLER TO HEAD THE GOVERNMENT 
HIS ADVISERS ASSURED HIM THAT HITLER COULD BE CONTROLLED 
AT THE END OF JANUARY NINETEEN THIRTY THREE PRESIDENT APPOINTED ADOLF HITLER THE FORMER ARMY CORPORAL CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY 
THE NEWS OF HITLER'S APPOINTMENT LED TO CELEBRATIONS IN CITIES ACROSS GERMANY 
THIS FILM WOULD ADDRESS IN SOME WAY YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT DOES THE MUSEUM RENDER THE HOLOCAUST IN ITS AS YOU SAY IN ITS SPECIFICITY AS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE THAT GREW OUT OF CONDITIONS IN GERMAN HISTORY 
YES 
WHAT IT DOES DO IT PROVIDE EVERYONE WITH A BASIC BACKGROUND OF THE MOST BASIC AND ESSENTIAL FACTS ABOUT THE DILEMMAS OF WEIMAR DEMOCRACY AND THE SETTING UNDER WHICH THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS COULD COME TO POWER 
SO YES I THINK IT DOES PROVIDE A VERY BASIC BUT NECESSARY COMMON 
IN THE DISPLAYS THAT TRACE THE POLICIES OF THE NAZI GOVERNMENT YOU CAN SEE THAT GERMAN ANTI SEMITISM WAS NOT JUST A CREED OF THE 
IN ONE FILM THE YOUNG MEN HEAVING BANNED BOOKS ONTO THE FIRE ARE ELITE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS 
THIS REMINDS US OF SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS THAT NATIONAL SOCIALISM HAD A GREAT DEAL OF APPEAL NOT JUST TO FARMERS AND NOT JUST TO UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE BUT TO EDUCATED PEOPLE TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TO UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS TO MEDICAL SCIENTISTS TO SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WHO SAW IN IT AN ANTIDOTE TO WHAT THEY SAW AS THE NEGATIVE ELEMENTS OF A LIBERAL CAPITALIST DEMOCRACY A REGIME THAT WOULD CREATE A SENSE OF NATIONAL UNITY AND NATIONAL PURPOSE THAT A LIBERAL CAPITALIST SOCIETY WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE 
AND THEY WERE ATTRACTED TO IT AND ATTRACTED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF REMAKING SOCIETY AND REMAKING EUROPE ALONG LINES THAT WOULD BE SET BY INTELLECTUALS 
THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTELLECTUALS WENT FURTHER 
THEORISTS OF RACIAL DIFFERENCE CONTRIBUTED THE PSEUDO SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR ATTEMPTING TO EXTINGUISH A PEOPLE 
HUMAN BEINGS THEY REASONED BELONGED TO RACES 
DIFFERENT PHYSICAL TYPES FORM OF A HIERARCHY OF MERIT WITH GERMANS AT THE TOP 
AND HERE WE HAVE A VERY STARTLING EXHIBIT OF HOW THIS IDEOLOGY WAS ACTUALLY APPLIED 
HERE WE HAVE AN EYE CHART OF VARIOUS EYE COLORS THAT WERE USED TO MATCH THESE EYE COLORS TO SEE WHICH TYPICALLY NORDIC CHARACTERISTICS PEOPLE HAD OR DIDN'T HAVE 
HERE WE HAVE HAIR SAMPLES THAT WERE USED TO GAUGE PEOPLE'S HAIR 
HERE WE HAVE THAT WERE USED TO MEASURE THE SIZE OF PEOPLE'S NOSES AND THEIR SO CALLED AND THE SIZE OF THEIR AND THEIR SO CALLED FACIAL ANGLES 
THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT BELIEVE IN RACIAL PSEUDO SCIENCE 
MANY OF THE PICTURES IN THESE EXHIBITS ARE MOUNTED ON VERTICAL BLACK BARS 
THE INNER WALLS OF THE MUSEUM ARE BRICK 
THE ELEVATORS SUGGEST A WAREHOUSE 
IT FEELS LIKE SOME HALF PRISON SLASH HALF FACTORY IN WHICH YOU ADVANCE THROUGH EVER NARROWING CORRIDORS 
THE VIDEOS THAT DOCUMENT THE HOLOCAUST ARE OFTEN SHIELDED BEHIND FOUR FOOT HIGH WALLS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM SEEING THE MOST GRAPHIC ATROCITIES 
THERE ARE ARTIFACTS HERE THAT OUT OF CONTEXT ARE COMPLETELY BUT IN THE SCHEME OF THE HOLOCAUST TURN HORRIBLE 
YOU CAN WALK THROUGH A GERMAN CATTLE CAR THE KIND THAT TRANSPORTED THE JEWS 
IT'S ALL OF EIGHT FEET BY TWENTY FIVE PERHAPS SEVEN FEET FROM FLOOR TO CEILING 
I HAD READ FOR YEARS AND TAUGHT FOR YEARS ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND I HAD SEEN MANY FILMS AND VIDEOS ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST 
I KNEW THE ROLE OF CATTLE CARS IN TRANSPORTING JEWS FROM TRANSIT CAMPS TO THE DEATH CAMPS 
BUT IT WAS ONLY BY ACTUALLY BEING IN THIS CAR AND REMEMBERING THAT ONE HUNDRED OR MORE PEOPLE WERE STUFFED INTO A CAR LIKE THIS FOR DAYS ON END THAT ONE THAT I REALLY GOT THE SENSE OF WHAT IT WAS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TO BE ENCLOSED IN SUCH A SMALL SPARTAN SPACE ENTIRELY WITHOUT FACILITIES WHICH ITSELF WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE THING 
IT RAISES THE LARGER ISSUE OF THE USE OF ARTIFACTS IN THIS MUSEUM OF ACTUAL THINGS FROM THE TIME AND PLACE 
I WAS WORRIED AT FIRST THAT IT WOULD BE MUSEUM LIKE IN THE SENSE OF PUTTING THESE THINGS ON DISPLAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ORIGINAL AND AUTHENTIC BUT REALLY I SEE NOW THAT WHAT'S OCCURRED IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE BACKGROUND OF THE INFORMATION BEHIND YOU THAT YOU GET FROM PICTURES AND VIDEOS AND TEXT AND SO ON THESE CAREFULLY CHOSEN OBJECTS GIVE YOU A CERTAIN FEEL FOR THE REALITY OF THE EVENT THAT ONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXPERIENCE FROM THESE OTHER MEDIA 
THE FIRST MEMORY OF CAMP IS SITTING IN THE CHAIR HAVING MY HAIR SHAVED 
AND I RECALL THE HAIR FALLING IN MY FACE MINGLING WITH MY TEARS AND THEN A UNIFORM BEING THROWN AT ME AND A PAIR AND PUSHED OUTSIDE 
THERE IS RECORDED TESTIMONY OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TELLING THEIR STORIES 
THERE'S A ROOM MODELED ON AN AUSCHWITZ BARRACKS AND IN THAT ROOM A VIDEO DISPLAY ONE THAT'S SHIELDED FROM CHILDREN SHOWS PICTURES TAKEN AT AUSCHWITZ AND BRINGS HOME AGAIN WHAT JERRY MULLER CALLS THE SPECIFICITY OF THE HOLOCAUST 
ONE SET OF IMAGES SHOWS A TEACHER WHO WAS A DWARF PHOTOGRAPHED BEFORE AND AFTER NAZI RESEARCHERS HAD HIM STABBED TO DEATH TO STUDY HIS SKELETON 
ANOTHER MAN SUBJECTED TO EXPERIMENTS WITH AIR PRESSURE IS SHOWN IN PROGRESSIVE STATES OF AGONY THEN A CROSS SECTION OF HIS BRAIN 
ALL THIS THE WORK OF DOCTORS SCIENTISTS 
IT SHOWS US AGAIN HOW THIS COMBINATION OF LEARNING AND TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY AND DEVOTION TO PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT AND TO ADVANCING ONE'S FIELD CAN GO TOGETHER WITH THE MOST TERRIBLE INHUMANITY 
AND EVEN AS THESE NOW WE'RE SEEING PICTURES OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE SUBJECTED TO STERILIZATION EXPERIMENTS AND CHILDREN DOCTOR MENGELE EXPERIMENTED ON AT AUSCHWITZ 
IN ALL CASES A PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD WAS KEPT 
THIS WAS NOT REGARDED WITH SHAME 
THESE WERE EXHIBITS OF EXPERIMENTATION 
YES 
AND ONE OF THE FACTS THAT MAKES SO MUCH OF THESE EXHIBITS POSSIBLE IS THAT THESE GERMAN SCIENTISTS TOOK PRIDE IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND MANY OF THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS WHO WERE INVOLVED WITH MASS MURDER TOOK A CERTAIN PRIDE IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
A LOT OF THE PICTURES THAT WE SEE IN VARIOUS PLACES IN THE MUSEUM WERE SNAPPED BY INDIVIDUAL SOLDIERS WHO TOOK THEM TO SHOW THE FAMILY BACK HOME WHAT WAS GOING ON 
AND SO THERE IS A TREMENDOUS PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED 
THE GERMANS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES TO MAKE RECORDS OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAMPS 
ALLIED LIBERATING ARMIES APPALLED AND REVOLTED BY WHAT THEY FOUND MADE FILMS TO DOCUMENT THE HORROR 
EXCERPTS FROM THOSE FILMS LIKE BRITISH ARMY'S FOOTAGE OF THE CAMP AT BERGEN ARE SHOWN ON VIDEO MONITORS TOWARD THE END OF THE EXHIBIT 
I AM THE REVEREND T. J. STRETCH ATTACHED AS TO THE FORMATION CONCERNING THIS CAMP 
I'VE BEEN HERE EIGHT DAYS AND NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN SUCH 
THIS MORNING WE BURIED OVER FIVE THOUSAND BODIES 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE 
BEHIND ME YOU CAN SEE A PIT WHICH WILL CONTAIN ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND 
THERE ARE TWO OTHERS LIKE IT IN PREPARATION 
ALL THESE DEATHS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SYSTEMATIC STARVATION AND AND DISEASE WHICH HAVE BEEN SPREAD BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENT METED OUT TO THESE POOR PEOPLE BY THEIR S. S. GUARDS AND THEIR S. S. CHIEF 
HISTORIAN JERRY MULLER CAME AWAY FROM THE MUSEUM IMPRESSED HIS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW WELL IT WOULD RECORD HISTORY SATISFIED 
AS FOR ITS PLACE NEAR AMERICA'S MALL ITS RELATIONSHIP TO OUR NATIONAL HISTORY PROFESSOR MULLER SAYS THE SETTING IS APPROPRIATE 
I MUST TELL YOU AFTER COMING THROUGH IT I CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL THAT AMERICANS AS AMERICANS LEARN FROM ALL THIS 
IF ONE WALKS FURTHER DOWN ON THE MALL ONE CAN GO TO THE AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM AND ONE SEES THE PLANES USED BY THE AMERICAN AIR FORCE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
IF ONE GOES TO THE MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY THERE'S AN EXCELLENT EXHIBIT ON THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN MUNITIONS 
BUT IT'S REALLY ONLY IN WALKING THROUGH THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM AND COMING TO THE END OF THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM AND SEEING THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE LIBERATION NOT JUST OF THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS BUT THE LIBERATION OF EUROPE FROM NATIONAL SOCIALISM THAT ONE APPRECIATES WHAT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS DISPLAYED ON THE MALL ARE FOR 
AND ONE REALIZES THAT IT'S IT WAS ONLY THE MOBILIZATION OF AMERICAN MILITARY POWER AND AMERICAN POLITICAL WILL THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE END OF THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST REGIME 
NOWADAYS IT'S VERY FASHIONABLE NOT TO BELIEVE IN THE REALITY OF GOOD AND EVIL 
WHAT THIS MUSEUM DOES IS IT REMINDS ANYONE AND EVERYONE OF THE REALITY OF EVIL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF AND THIS MUSEUM DOES IT IN A WAY THAT NOTHING ELSE ON THE MALL DOES

TOMORROW PRESIDENT CLINTON AND NOBEL LAUREATE ELIE WIESEL ARE AMONG THE SPEAKERS AT THE MUSEUM'S DEDICATION
