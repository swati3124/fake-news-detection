WELCOME TO LARRY KING LIVE 
TONIGHT THE PACKWOOD AFFAIR MORE IMPROPER ADVANCES HIT THE HEADLINES BUT THE OFFICIAL PROBE HAS JUST BEGUN 
IS THE SENATOR GETTING A PREMATURE TRIAL 
PLUS THE RISE OF THE JURY PACKWOOD ZOE BAIRD NEW TAXES MILLIONS DELIVER INSTANT VERDICTS WASHINGTON LISTENS BUT WOULD IT PLEASE THE FOUNDING FATHERS 
NOW HERE'S MARY TILLOTSON SITTING IN FOR LARRY KING 
GOOD EVENING 
THE POLITICAL WEATHER REPORT FOR WASHINGTON AND VICINITY HOT HARSH WITH OCCASIONAL 
IT NOW TAKES JUST HOURS TO PERMANENTLY BURN A POLITICAL APPOINTEE 
SOME NEVER EVEN COME OUT IN PUBLIC FOR FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES 
WE SAW THAT JUST THIS WEEK WITH JUDGE KIMBA WOOD 
SO WHEN VERDICTS ON CHARACTER FORM SO FAST AND SO MERCILESSLY WHAT HAPPENS TO SENATOR BOB PACKWOOD 
WEEKEND NEWS REPORTS SAID THIRTEEN MORE WOMEN NOW CHARGE HE KISSED THEM THEM OR OTHERWISE MADE UNWELCOME PASSES OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
THAT MAKES TWENTY THREE ACCUSERS IN ALL MANY OF THEM ANONYMOUS 
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CALLS FOR HIM TO RESIGN 
PACKWOOD HIMSELF HAS LAIN LOW 
HE AND HIS STAFF DECLINED INVITATIONS TO BE HERE WITH US TONIGHT 
THEN AGAIN THE SENATE ETHICS PANEL IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING ITS INVESTIGATION 
WE'LL LOOK THIS EVENING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO SENATOR PACKWOOD 
WE'LL HEAR FROM A DEFENDER AND A CRITIC 
BUT FIRST JEAN MCMAHON ONE OF THE SENATOR'S ACCUSERS 
SHE'S JOINING US NOW FROM PHILADELPHIA 
MS. MCMAHON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US 
YOUR UNPLEASANT WITH SENATOR PACKWOOD WAS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED 
WELL I WAS APPLYING FOR A JOB 
I WANTED TO MOVE TO PORTLAND 
I WAS LIVING IN SALEM AT THE TIME 
AND I CALLED THE SENATOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE I HAD HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO INCREASE HIS STAFF 
AND AFTER A FEW DAYS THE SENATOR HIMSELF CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT HE'D LIKE TO MEET ME AND TO GET SOME WRITING SAMPLES AND THAT HE'D LIKE TO GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION AND ASK ME TO DO A DRAFT OF A SPEECH 
SO I ARRANGED WITH HIM TO MEET AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE 
HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN 
HOW OLD WERE YOU 
ABOUT THIRTY 
ALL RIGHT 
AND WE MET IN A MOTEL AT THE EDGE OF SALEM 
AND AT THAT POINT I WAS FEELING A LITTLE AWKWARD BUT NOTHING HAPPENED 
I GOT THE INFORMATION THAT I NEEDED AND THEN OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I TALKED WITH HIM SEVERAL TIMES 
AND THEN WE ARRANGED TO MEET ON THE COAST IN OREGON AT THE CONFERENCE WHICH IS A REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE 
AS IT TURNED OUT THAT AGAIN WAS IN A MOTEL ROOM AND I WAS THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THERE AND WITHIN A FEW MINUTES 
DID HE SUGGEST YOUR COMING TO THE HOTEL ROOM 
YES 
THIS WAS HIS IDEA 
ALL RIGHT 
YES 
AND WE NEVER GOT INTO A DISCUSSION OF ANY OF THE MATERIALS I HAD WRITTEN OR BROUGHT WITH ME 
HE VERY WITHIN A FEW MINUTES STARTED CHASING ME AROUND THE TABLE AND GRABBED ME AND KISSED ME 
AND THEN I JUST GOT OUT AS FAST AS I COULD 
THE SENATOR AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE MISTAKES WHICH HE HIMSELF DESCRIBED AT ONE POINT AS BEING INAPPROPRIATE WERE WHEN HE'D HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK 
HAD HE BEEN DRINKING THAT NIGHT 
NO NOT THAT I REMEMBER 
AND HAD YOU DONE ANYTHING TO LEAD HIM TO BELIEVE YOU WANTED HIM TO CHASE YOU AROUND THE TABLE AND KISS YOU 
I DON'T THINK SO 
NOT AS YOU WOULD DEFINE IT 
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM WHO WOULD SAY THAT ALL OF THE WOMEN OR MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE COME FORWARD NOW AND MADE THESE CHARGES ARE DOING IT WITH SOME POLITICAL MOTIVATION 
HOW ABOUT YOU 
I HAD LITERALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE INCIDENT UNTIL THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTER CALLED IN OCTOBER 
MY LIFE WAS FINE BEFORE ALL THIS STARTED 
I HAD NO REASON TO GO AFTER HIM 
HOW DID THE POST REPORTER KNOW 
DID YOU TELL PEOPLE FRIENDS ABOUT IT AT THE TIME 
YOU MUST HAVE TOLD SOMEBODY IF THE POST GOT HOLD OF IT 
YES 
WELL I CAME HOME IN SHOCK AND I TOLD MY NOW HUSBAND AND I TOLD OH AS IT TURNED OUT AT LEAST TEN OTHER PEOPLE 
AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE AND THEN WE JUST ALL KIND OF FORGOT ABOUT IT 
AND THEN I MOVED AWAY SO IT JUST SLIPPED OUT OF MY MIND 
SO WHEN THE POST REPORTER CALLED AND SAID DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPEN TO YOU AND IT CAME BACK I SAID YES AND THEN I TOLD HIM THE STORY AND THEN HE SAID WE MAY COME BACK TO YOU AND ASK FOR CORROBORATION 
AND AT THAT POINT I CALLED UP THE PEOPLE THAT I REMEMBERED BEING CLOSE TO AT THAT POINT AND SAID DO YOU REMEMBER THIS AND ALL OF THEM REMEMBERED IN VIVID DETAIL WHICH SURPRISED ME SINCE IT WAS SO LONG AGO 
ARE YOU GOING TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE ETHICS COMMITTEE IF THEY CALL YOU OR HAVE YOU ALREADY TALKED TO THEM 
ON JANUARY NINETEENTH I MET WITH TWO STAFF ATTORNEYS AND A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ON THE ETHICS COMMITTEE STAFF AND GAVE THEM MY STORY AGAIN AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GET A COPY OF THE TESTIMONY TO GO THROUGH AND THEN SEND BACK TO THEM SIGNED 
AND AT THIS POINT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT TESTIMONY YET 
WE MAY HAVE TO COME BACK 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU SAY YOU'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT YOURSELF FOR YEARS 
IT MUST THEN NOT HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLY EVENT 
NO I MEAN IT DIDN'T SCAR ME OBVIOUSLY 
IT WAS JUST I'VE NEVER HAD THAT HAPPEN BEFORE WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS GOING INTO A JOB INTERVIEW 
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE BEFORE OR AGAIN 
IS IT THE SORT OF EXPERIENCE HE SHOULD LOSE HIS JOB OVER 
IF IT WERE JUST ME I'D SAY NO 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A PATTERN OF INAPPROPRIATE TREATMENT TOWARD WOMEN TO ME IT REALLY SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS HALF THE POPULATION IN HIS STATE CERTAINLY 
SINCE THE SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE DECIDED THEY WOULD EMPLOY THE RAPE SHIELD LAW IN EFFECT TELLING SENATOR PACKWOOD HE CANNOT BRING UP THE SEXUAL HISTORY OF THE WOMEN WHO'VE ACCUSED HIM IT'S SOMETHING HE HAD EARLIER SUGGESTED HE MIGHT DO IN HIS OWN DEFENSE SEVERAL MORE WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE STILL MORE WOMEN THAN THE TWENTY THREE WHOM WE'VE HEARD FROM WOMEN WHO ARE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD FOR WHATEVER NOTORIETY IT MIGHT BRING TO THEM OR DISCOMFORT 
I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW OF ANY 
BEYOND THAT IT WOULD JUST BE CONJECTURE 
I'M IN PHILADELPHIA SO I'M SO FAR AWAY I'M NOT LIKELY TO RUN INTO WOMEN WHO HAVE STORIES 
YOU KNOW SOME GUYS JUST ARE SORT OF SEXUAL AND THEIR ANTENNA DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL FIGURING OUT WHO'S RECEPTIVE AND WHO'S NOT 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT EITHER SHOULD OR WILL BE WRITING RULES ABOUT AS THEY HEAR THIS CASE 
WELL IF IT HAS AN IMPACT ON A JOB SITUATION YES I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THERE TO BE RULES 
AND THIS AGAIN IS WHERE YOU SEE THE PATTERN UNFOLD 
YES 
YES 
WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES IS ANOTHER THING BUT WHEN IT HAS AN EFFECT ON RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORKPLACE YES I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MAKE RULES ABOUT IT 
YOU'RE IN PHILADELPHIA WHICH IS NOT THE SAME CITY AS WASHINGTON 
IT IS WIDELY THOUGHT HERE THAT POWER IS A GREAT APHRODISIAC 
AND CAPITOL HILL IS FULL OF VERY PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN SOME OF WHOM ARE RECEPTIVE TO SENATORS AND OTHERS IN POWER WHO APPROACH THEM SEXUALLY 
DO WOMEN HELP CONFUSE THE SIGNALS THAT MEN GET 
YES IT'S TRUE 
AND I'M SURE SOME WOMEN HAVE BECOME VERY POWERFUL BY THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY'VE FORMED 
I THINK IT'S TOO BAD 
THAT IT IS 
I THANK YOU JEAN MCMAHON 
WHEN WE RETURN A LOBBYIST ON WOMEN'S ISSUES WHO SAYS PACKWOOD SHOULD RESIGN AND AN OREGON ACTIVIST WHO SAYS THE SENATOR IS NOT GETTING A FAIR HEARING 
DON'T GO AWAY 
IN THE SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE WE'LL HAVE A FULL HEARING THERE 
THE ETHICS COMMITTEE MAY BE CLOSED 
A LOT OF OREGONIANS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR YOUR EXPLANATIONS 
DON'T YOU DESERVE THE PEOPLE IN THIS STATE AN EXPLANATION 
WELL THAT I'M GOING TO RESPOND FULLY AND FAIRLY TO THE SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE AND I THINK I MEAN THESE ARE CHARGES OF VIOLATING THE SENATE ETHICS RULES AND THAT'S WHERE THE HEARING OUGHT TO BE 
WELCOME BACK TO LARRY KING LIVE 
JANE IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WOMEN'S CAMPAIGN FUND A MAJOR POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN HEAVILY CRITICAL OF SENATOR PACKWOOD AND WANTS HIM TO RESIGN 
AND IN THE SENATOR'S HOME STATE OF OREGON WE ARE JOINED BY JEANETTE SLEPIAN A FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR PACKWOOD WHO NOW HEADS OREGONIANS FOR A FAIR HEARING 
THANKS TO THE BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS EVENING 
WE'LL START WITH JEANETTE OUT IN OREGON 
WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S NOT GETTING A FAIR HEARING 
REGRETTABLY THIS IS OFTEN THE WAY IT IS IF YOU'RE A PUBLIC FIGURE SOMEONE MAKES CHARGES THEY ARE WIDELY REPORTED 
WELL I THINK MARY IN YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR INTERVIEW WITH JEAN YOU INDICATED THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUALS MAKING ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE SENATOR 
AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD FROM TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUALS 
OF THE TWENTY THREE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SENATOR PACKWOOD THIRTEEN ARE FROM ANONYMOUS INDIVIDUALS 
OF THE TEN WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES TWO HAVE SAID AT THIS POINT THEY DO NOT PLAN TO TESTIFY AND THAT LEAVES EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WHO AT THIS POINT WE BELIEVE MAY BE WILLING TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH AND HAVE RELEVANT CROSS EXAMINATION AS TO THE WAY THEY REMEMBER THE STORY 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW AMERICANS WHO WOULD TOLERATE BEING ACCUSED BY ANONYMOUS INDIVIDUALS ACCUSATIONS MANY OF WHICH WERE SOLICITED BY AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER WHICH WAS SET UP FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE TO SOLICIT ALLEGATIONS ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS DESIGNED TO TAKE YOUR JOB AWAY 
ANONYMOUS TO THE PUBLIC OR ANONYMOUS TO THE SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE 
OR BOTH 
WELL AT THIS POINT THEY APPEAR TO BE ANONYMOUS TO BOTH 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPECT ANYONE TO FIGHT DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS WHICH ARE REPORTED BY SOME AREAS OF THE MEDIA AS THE GOSPEL TRUTH WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOUR ACCUSERS ARE 
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL OF OUR WHOLE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO CONFRONT YOUR ACCUSERS 
AND WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ACCUSERS INDIVIDUALS MAKING ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE SENATOR REMAIN ANONYMOUS IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT 
I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO CHARACTERIZE THE STAGE WE ARE AT NOW IS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS ARE TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHAT WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY WAS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES 
AND IN THIS REGARD MARY IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES PEOPLE WERE ACCUSED OFTENTIMES ACCUSED OF ASSOCIATIONS THAT WERE ONE OR TWO DECADES OLD 
LET'S GET JANE IN HERE 
WHY DO YOU THINK SOME OF THOSE WOMEN ARE ANONYMOUS 
WELL SEXUAL HARASSMENT EVEN IN THE POST HILL SLASH THOMAS ERA IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN VERY 
CLARENCE THOMAS YOU MEAN 
YES THAT'S RIGHT A VERY VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE TO BRING FORWARD AND DISCUSS 
AND ONE OF THE REASONS FRANKLY WHY I AND SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN OREGON SUPPORTED PACKWOOD'S RESIGNATION IS FRANKLY FOR A DUE PROCESS REASON 
YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE DUE PROCESS OF THE SENATOR BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DUE PROCESS OF THE WOMEN AND ALSO THE DUE PROCESS IN THE RIGHTS OF THE VOTERS OF OREGON 
AND FRANKLY THEY ARE WITHOUT A SENATOR 
SENATOR PACKWOOD WHILE ONCE A VERY GOOD AND EFFECTIVE SENATOR A GOOD FRIEND OF THE WOMEN'S COMMUNITY IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE 
HE CANNOT RETURN TO HIS HOME STATE WITH 
DO YOU THINK HE STOLE THE ELECTION 
HE KNEW THE POST WAS LOOKING INTO THIS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND MISLED OREGON REPORTERS ABOUT THIS 
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN STOLE THE ELECTION LIED TO THE ELECTORATE 
THERE ISN'T ANY QUESTION THAT PRIOR TO HIS 
JANE I'D LIKE TO JUMP IN HERE 
LET ME JUST 
I'D LIKE TO JUMP IN HERE 
WE'LL LET YOU IN IN JUST A MOMENT JEANETTE 
O. K. 
THE WASHINGTON POST IN NOVEMBER PRINTED A STORY THAT THREE WEEKS PRIOR TO THE ELECTION THIS SENATOR DELIBERATELY TRIED TO COVER UP THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
HE LIED TO THE OREGONIAN REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION BY THE WASHINGTON POST 
AND FRANKLY THE ONLY JUSTICE AND THE ONLY REALLY JUST WAY THAT THIS CAN BE IS FOR HIM TO RESIGN AND FOR THE VOTERS TO HAVE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT THEIR SENATOR BASED ON ALL OF THE FACTS 
TAKE IT JEANETTE 
I KNOW YOU DO NOT THINK HE STOLE THE ELECTION 
YES I THINK THAT WE HAVE REACHED A VERY SAD STATE IN OUR COUNTRY WHEN ON THE BASIS OF ALLEGATIONS ONLY WE WOULD DEMAND THAT A PERSON'S JOB BE TAKEN AWAY THAT EITHER THEY RESIGN THE JOB OR IT BE FORCEFULLY TAKEN AWAY ON THE BASIS OF ALLEGATIONS ONLY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN TO IN A FORUM WHERE SOMEONE CAN TESTIFY UNDER OATH AND BE SUBJECT TO CROSS EXAMINATION 
IT IS SHOCKING TO ME 
IN THIS STATE WE HAVE A MEMBER OF A FORMER OF THE SUPREME COURT A FORMER MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT WHO ABOVE ALL ELSE SHOULD BE PROTECTING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS TO A FULL HEARING UNDER OATH 
AND FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL OR JANE OR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE THIS IS A POLITICALLY CORRECT ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BY THE WAY IF YOU'LL NOTICE THAT EVERYONE NOW HAS BACKED AWAY THAT NO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE SENATOR RISE TO THE LEGAL TEST OF WHAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS THEY ARE NOW BEING CHARACTERIZED AS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT NOT SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT ON THE BASIS OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ONLY THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIS JOB AWAY 
AND THAT IS A SAD STATE IN OUR HISTORY AND REALLY BACK TO THE FIFTIES AND THE MCCARTHY DAYS WHEN FAMILIES JOBS AND CAREERS WERE DESTROYED ON THE BASIS OF ALLEGATIONS ONLY 
JEANETTE AS YOU KNOW THE SENATE ETHICS COMMITTEE NOW WILL ALSO BE LOOKING INTO WHETHER OR NOT THE SENATOR INAPPROPRIATELY USED SOME OF HIS GOVERNMENT PAID STAFF IN ANY EFFORT TO INTIMIDATE WITNESSES IN EFFECT SCARE THEM AWAY FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE HEARING 
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHY SOME OF THE WOMEN WHO ARE ACCUSERS ARE ANONYMOUS 
NO AND I HAVE NO COMMENT AND NO KNOWLEDGE IN TERMS OF STAFF OR CAMPAIGN STAFF 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN GATHERING ON TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE JANE NOT THREE WEEKS NOTICE 
THE SENATOR WAS PRESENTED WITH ALLEGATIONS BY THE WASHINGTON POST ON OCTOBER TWENTY NINTH ALLEGATIONS BY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS 
AND HE HAD NEVER SEEN THOSE ALLEGATIONS PRIOR TO OCTOBER TWENTY NINTH 
HE WAS GIVEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO RESPOND 
AND HE IS 
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY MEMBERS WHO WORKED DILIGENTLY WERE CAMPAIGN STAFF MEMBERS AT THAT TIME 
AND I MUST COMMENT HERE THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE FOR ANYONE TO SAY THAT THE SENATOR IN HIS COMMENTS BACK TO THE WASHINGTON POST SMEARED THOSE INDIVIDUALS 
THE SENATOR HAS NOT RELEASED THOSE COMMENTS NEITHER HAS THE WASHINGTON POST 
THE ONLY THING THAT HAS BEEN SAID 
WELL THE WASHINGTON POST JEANETTE HAS SAID THAT SOMEONE FROM SENATOR PACKWOOD'S OFFICE FAXED THEM INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THESE WOMEN'S SEXUAL HISTORIES INVOLVING PRESUMABLY PERSONS OTHER THAN PACKWOOD 
THE CHARACTERIZATION ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST STORY SAID THAT SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PRESENTED TO THE WASHINGTON POST CONTAINED INFORMATION THAT MAY BE POTENTIALLY EMBARRASSING TO THE INDIVIDUALS 
HOWEVER EMBARRASSING INFORMATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS SMEARED 
AND SINCE WHEN IN THIS CONTEXT THE SENATOR IS BASICALLY IN THE ROLE OF A DEFENDANT AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING HERE IS THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO TRY TO DEFEND HIMSELF IN ANY CONTEXT BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS SEXUALLY THIS POLITICALLY CORRECT ISSUE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
THOSE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED EITHER BY THE POST OR BY THE SENATOR 
AND FOR JULIE WILLIAMSON OR ANYONE TO CHARACTERIZE THEM AS LYING OR SMEARING IT HAS GOT TO BE SMOKE BECAUSE WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T SEEN THEM AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE SENATOR HAS NO INTENTION OF RESPONDING 
WE'RE QUICKLY GOING TO LET JANE IN HERE 
GO AHEAD JANE 
I THINK WE'RE LOSING SIGHT REALLY OF THE LARGER ISSUE 
WE HAVE A SENATOR HERE WHO AT ONE TIME SERVED US WELL 
HE IS NOW LITERALLY UNABLE TO FUNCTION 
HE IS UNABLE TO SERVE HIS CONSTITUENTS 
HE'S UNABLE TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LEADER ON THE VERY ISSUES FOR WHICH HE'S BEEN ELECTED 
HE IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR 
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN ORDINARY CITIZEN 
HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ALLEGED SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY TWENTY THREE WOMEN 
MANY OF THEM SIGNED 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT JANE NOT SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
MANY OF THEM SIGNED AFFIDAVITS 
THEY HAVE BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD 
WE SAW ONE WOMAN VERY GRACIOUS WOMAN COME FORWARD AND TALK WITH US TONIGHT 
THE VOTERS OF OREGON THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY DO NOT HAVE A UNITED STATES SENATOR 
THEY ARE BEING DISENFRANCHISED 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK BUT WE'VE GOT LOTS MORE TO TALK ABOUT 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 
THIS IS LARRY KING LIVE IN WASHINGTON 
SENATOR PACKWOOD WAS REALLY A LEADER ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUES AND NOW WE KNOW THAT THIS REALLY A PATTERN OF SEXUAL PREDATORY BEHAVIOR OVER THE COURSE OF TIME THAT HE SERVED AS OUR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE U. S. SENATE 
WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT THIS IS NOT SIMPLY AN ISSUE OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT ABUSE OF POWER 
WELCOME BACK AS WE CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THE TRIALS OF SENATOR BOB PACKWOOD 
AND A QUESTION TO JANE JEANETTE WAS SAYING THAT YOU ARE HOT ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS POLITICALLY CORRECT TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL IMPROPRIETIES 
BUT ISN'T THE TRUTH THAT MANY ORGANIZED WOMEN'S GROUPS IN WASHINGTON DID NOT HIM VERY HARD BECAUSE HE WAS POLITICALLY CORRECT ON SUCH ISSUES AS ABORTION 
HE'S A DEFENDER OF ABORTION RIGHTS 
IF THIS HAD BEEN CLARENCE THOMAS OR ALAN SIMPSON OR ARLEN SPECTER ACCUSED OF THIS YOU FOLKS WOULD HAVE BEEN ON HIM LIKE A DUCK ON A WOULDN'T YOU 
SERIOUSLY 
WELL I THINK THIS IS CLEARLY ONE CASE WHERE THE WASHINGTON WOMEN'S COMMUNITY WAS BEHIND THE CURVE AND WE REALLY DIDN'T 
AND BEHIND THE VOTERS OF OREGON 
ABSOLUTELY 
WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION AND DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW STRONGLY THE OREGON VOTERS FELT ABOUT THEIR OWN SENATOR BEING CHARGED WITH SUCH SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS 
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT WAS THE LOCAL FOR EXAMPLE NOT THE NATIONAL THAT CALLED FOR HIS RESIGNATION THE LOCAL NOW NOT THE NATIONAL NOW 
BUT WE WERE FINALLY YOU KNOW REALIZED THAT THE VOTERS OF OREGON HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO IS THEIR SENATOR NOT WE IN WASHINGTON 
WE'VE GOT A CALL FROM ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO 
MARY 
MARY 
WELL LET'S TAKE THE CALL FIRST JEANETTE 
I'M SURE THERE'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAP BACK IN 
O. K. 
GO AHEAD ALBUQUERQUE 
O. K. YES MY QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S FAIR THAT CONGRESS PASSED THE LAWS AND THEN EXEMPTED THEMSELVES FROM IT 
JEANETTE DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE AND THEN SEGUE FROM THERE INTO WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANTED TO SAY 
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT E. E. O. C. LAWS AND ALL OTHER LAWS THAT APPLY TO PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES SHOULD APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS 
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SENATOR PACKWOOD WAS THE FIRST STAFF ON THE SENATE TO HAVE CODES OF CONDUCT OFFICIALLY CREATED FOR HIS OFFICE TO AND PRESCRIBE WHAT BEHAVIOR WAS APPROPRIATE 
I WOULD ALSO THOUGH LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF SENATOR PACKWOOD'S LEADERSHIP 
QUICKLY PLEASE SO WE CAN GET ANOTHER CALL IN 
SENATOR PACKWOOD'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WOMEN'S AREA 
I THINK THAT THERE IS NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL ON CAPITOL HILL DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN WHO HAS BEEN A GREATER LEADER FOR WOMEN'S ISSUES 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT BOB PACKWOOD HAS LED THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S ISSUES 
AND IF WE ACCEPT WHAT THE WASHINGTON POST SAID AND JANE SEEMS TO WANT TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING THAT THE WASHINGTON POST HAS SAID IN ITS TOTALITY THAT IT IS TOTALLY CREDIBLE THEN THE OTHER PART THAT THE WASHINGTON POST SAID THAT THERE WERE RUMORS ABOUT BOB PACKWOOD IN WASHINGTON FOR YEARS I DON'T ACCEPT A LOT OF WHAT THE WASHINGTON POST SAID BUT JANE APPARENTLY WANTS TO ACCEPT IT SO LET'S ACCEPT IT IN ITS TOTALITY 
JANE WOMEN'S GROUPS THEN USED BOB PACKWOOD 
YOU NEEDED HIM 
YOU USED HIM 
AND THE REASON YOU DON'T NEED HIM NOW IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE CONGRESS 
BOB PACKWOOD DID NOT BETRAY THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT BETRAYED BOB PACKWOOD 
JEANETTE DO YOU THINK THAT THE PACKWOOD CASE MAY INCREASE PRESSURE ON CONGRESS TO BRING ITSELF UNDER E. E. O. C. LAWS 
OH ABSOLUTELY 
AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I THINK THAT THEY WILL PASS SIMILAR GUIDELINES FOR THEM AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME GUIDELINES THAT ALL OF US IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE TO LIVE BY 
LET'S TAKE THIS CALL 
SEATTLE WASHINGTON GO AHEAD 
DOESN'T A WOMAN COMPROMISE HERSELF BY TAKING A JOB INTERVIEW IN A HOTEL ROOM 
I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT 
I DON'T THINK SHE HAD THE JOB INTERVIEW IN THE HOTEL ROOM DID SHE 
I THINK SHE HAD PREPARED SOME PAPERWORK FOR THE SENATOR OR A BRIEF OF SOME SORT AND THAT THE SUGGESTION WAS SHE BRING IT BY THERE AND THEY GO OVER IT 
I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS WELL TAKEN HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS SHE COULD HAVE SUGGESTED A RESTAURANT 
BUT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES AND PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT SHE KNEW HIM BETTER 
AT LEAST JEAN MCMAHON IS MAKING HER ALLEGATIONS IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY 
SHE'S NOT MAKING THEM 
SHE HAS TESTIFIED TO THEM IN A LEGAL DEPOSITION AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS PREPARED TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE ETHICS 
THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL JUDICIAL PROCESS IN OUR COUNTRY 
AND FOR ANYONE TO WANT TO ABROGATE IT IS WRONG 
JEAN STORY HOWEVER DOES RAISE TWO CRITICAL ISSUES OF FACT THAT WILL BE SUBJECT OR SHOULD BE SUBJECT 
QUICKLY PLEASE JEANETTE 
TO CROSS EXAMINATION 
NUMBER ONE SHE HAS SAID THAT TWICE SHE WENT TO HIS HOTEL ROOM AND IN HER STORY SHE SAID THE SECOND TIME SHE WAS SURPRISED THAT HE WAS ALONE 
THE SECOND CRITICAL ISSUE THAT SHE DID NOT MENTION TONIGHT BUT DID TELL THE WASHINGTON POST IS THAT SHE WAS NOT SO TRAUMATIZED BY THIS INCIDENT THAT SHE DID NOT CALL HIS OFFICE TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER TO ASK IF SHE GOT THE JOB 
THIS WAS NOT A TRAUMATIZED INDIVIDUAL AS SHE NOW APPARENTLY APPEARS LOOKING BACK TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE INCIDENT TO PORTRAY IT 
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER CALL 
MISSOURI GO AHEAD 
YES I HAVE A QUESTION AS TO THE ANONYMITY OF THESE ACCUSERS OF SENATOR PACKWOOD 
IF YOU WISH TO ABIDE BY THE LAW THIS MAN HAS EVERY RIGHT TO USE ANYTHING RELEVANT TO HIS DEFENSE TO PROVE HIS CASE 
IF IT'S EMBARRASSING TO THEM WHAT DO THEY THINK IT'S DOING TO HIM 
WE FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE 
AS WOMEN SHOULD WE NOT STAND UP FOR HIS RIGHT TO DEFEND HIS CIVIL LIBERTIES AGAINST ANYBODY ANYBODY WHO ACCUSES HIM OF ANYTHING 
JANE 
AGAIN I THINK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I AGREE WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT RIGHTS AND JUSTICES BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO CONSIDER THE RIGHTS OF THE VOTERS OF OREGON 
AND I KEEP GOING BACK TO MY INITIAL POINT AND THAT IS THAT THE VOTERS OF OREGON DO NOT HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE 
THEY DO NOT HAVE A SENATOR 
THEY DO NOT HAVE A SENATOR THAT CAN MEET HIS CONSTITUENTS 
THEY DO NOT HAVE A SENATOR THAT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE FIGHTER FOR LEGISLATION 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR SOMEONE WHO SHOULD BE HELD TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD THAT WE CAN HOLD ANY INDIVIDUAL SOMEONE WHO SHOULD REPRESENT ALL OF US IN THE OPTIMUM WAY 
AND CLEARLY SENATOR PACKWOOD'S BEHAVIOR HIS ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT THESE WOMEN HAS NOT BEEN WITH THOSE KINDS OF STANDARDS 
JANE SENATOR PACKWOOD WAS THE ELECTED SENATOR FROM THIS STATE AND HE REPRESENTS US QUITE 
HE IS NOW CONDUCTING HIS SECOND SWING THROUGH THIS STATE 
AND HE 
NO LET HER HAVE HER SAY NOW 
AND IS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THIS STATE 
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT HERE IS THAT THE GENESIS OF THIS STORY STARTED IN THE HEAT OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN 
THE OREGONIAN DID KNOW ABOUT THIS STORY PUBLISHED A COLUMN ABOUT THIS STORY IN MARCH OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
THE STORY TELLS THAT 
LAST WORD I'M AFRAID IS YOURS JEANETTE 
WE'RE ALL OUT OF TIME 
O. K. 
BUT THANKS VERY MUCH TO OUR TWO GUESTS JANE OF THE WOMEN'S CAMPAIGN FUND 
THANK YOU 
JEANETTE SLEPIAN OF OREGONIANS FOR A FAIR HEARING WHO HAS JOINED US TONIGHT FROM PORTLAND 
I'M MARY TILLOTSON 
LARRY KING LIVE WILL BE BACK IN JUST A MINUTE
