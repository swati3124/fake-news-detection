PHONE BOOKS HAVE LONG BEEN A FAVORITE ITEM FOR 
AND NOW THE PHONE COMPANY IS GETTING IN ON THE ACT 
C. N. N.'S SEAN CALLEBS HAS MORE ON THIS EARTH SMART REPORT 
BELL TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES ARE GETTING A NEW LIFE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
THE THICK WEIGHTY PHONE BOOKS ARE RETURNING AS ENVELOPES IN MONTHLY CUSTOMER PHONE BILLS 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MILLION BILLS A MONTH 
THEY SAY USING RECYCLED ENVELOPES MADE FROM OLD PHONE BOOKS WILL SAVE TONS OF LANDFILL SPACE 
AND THE REASON WE WERE SO EXCITED ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE IT DOES REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORIES THAT ARE GOING INTO THE LANDFILLS HERE IN THE SOUTHEAST 
THE RECYCLED ENVELOPES ARE A DISTINCTIVE GREY COLOR 
SAYS THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT 
WE DO NOT BLEACH ANY OF THE MATERIAL AND WE USE IT IN RAW FORM FROM THE DIRECTORIES 
SAYS LAST YEAR COMMUNITY RECYCLING PROGRAMS DIVERTED EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF OLD PHONE BOOKS FROM LANDFILLS 
OFFICIALS HOPE THIS NEW ENVELOPE RECYCLING PROGRAM WILL SAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND TONS
