DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN OF NEW YORK IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS US NOW FROM CAPITOL HILL 
WELCOME SENATOR MOYNIHAN 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU JUST HEARD BUT VICE PRESIDENT GORE WAS SAYING IN THAT REPORT FROM BOB FRANKEN THAT IT WAS 
INCONCEIVABLE 
INCONCEIVABLE 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WON'T COME TO AN AGREEMENT 
WOULD AGREE YOU WITH HIM 
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE 
THE ISSUE AS CHAIRMAN ROSTENKOWSKI HAS SAID IS CAN WE GOVERN NOW A NATION THAT'S BEEN HERE AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WE HAVE HAS PROVEN IT CAN GOVERN 
IT'S UP AGAINST A TEST 
IT IS UNLIKE ANY LEGISLATIVE TEST WE PROBABLY HAVE HAD IN THIS CENTURY 
BUT WE WILL DO IT BECAUSE IT HAS GOT TO BE DONE AND IN THE END EACH OF US ON OUR SIDE KNOWS THAT AND YOU CLAIM THAT ULTIMATE NECESSITY 
BUT SENATOR AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND SOME ODD MEMBERS OF THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE 
YOU'VE GOT REPUBLICANS ON THE ONE SIDE SAYING THEY DON'T WANT ANY SPENDING INCREASE 
YOU'VE GOT SOME DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
WE JUST HEARD FROM A FEW OF THEM SAYING YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE MORE SPENDING 
HOW HARD IS IT GOING TO BE TO COME TO A MEETING OF THE MINDS 
IT'S NOT THAT HARD 
IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY IN THE SUB CONFERENCE THAT WILL BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE ON SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS THAT WILL MEET TO 
NOW TELL US WHO'S IN THAT WHO IS THAT SUB 
WELL CHAIRMAN ROSTENKOWSKI ON THE HOUSE SIDE 
HE WILL NAME HIS CONFEREES IN ANY HOUR NOW 
OURS ARE READY ON THE SENATE SIDE 
HOW MANY WILL THAT AND HOW MANY PEOPLE 
THERE'LL BE SEVEN DEMOCRATS SIX I BELIEVE REPUBLICANS 
THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN A PERFECTLY YOU KNOW STRAIGHTFORWARD GOOD NATURED POSITION IS THAT THEY AREN'T GOING TO PARTICIPATE 
NOW THAT DIDN'T MEAN 
YOU MEAN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SIT IN ON THE MEETING 
OH THEY'LL BE THERE AND MAYBE COMMENT BUT IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A PARTY LINE VOTE 
IT WAS IN THE COMMITTEE ITSELF IT WAS ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE 
BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A MAJORITY 
SENATOR THE GREATEST GAP SEEMS TO BE ON THIS QUESTION OF ENERGY TAXES 
YEAH YEAH 
YOU SAID ON SUNDAY ON MEET THE PRESS' THAT YOU BELIEVE THE FINAL VERSION MIGHT INCLUDE A GASOLINE TAX THAT'S A FEW CENTS A GALLON HIGHER THAN THE FOUR POINT THREE CENTS VOTED ON BY THE SENATE AND SLASH OR A NEW TAX ON UTILITY USE 
DO YOU STILL THINK THAT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY 
WELL I CERTAINLY HOPE WE CAN STAY WITH THAT SIMPLE GASOLINE TAX 
WE KNOW HOW TO COLLECT IT YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S PAID 
THERE'S ALREADY FOURTEEN POINT ONE CENT TAX 
NO ONE LIKES TO RAISE TAXES BUT YOU HAVE TO RAISE REVENUES 
WE LAST YEAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR FINISHED UP WE ARE HAVE THE LARGEST DEFICIT IN OUR HISTORY TWO HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS 
JUDY I REMEMBER WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON WAS GOING CRAZY AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE OR DRIVING EVERYONE AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE CRAZY BECAUSE HIS NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE BUDGET MIGHT PASS FOR THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS 
WE NOW HAVE A DEFICIT OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS 
IT CAN'T GO ON 
WELL IF THE CURRENT GAS TAX SCENARIO THAT COMES OUT OF THE SENATE WOULD RAISE TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS HOW MANY MORE BILLION ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SPLITTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE SENATE VOTED AND WHAT THE HOUSE VOTED WITH THE SO CALLED BTU 
THAT WOULD BE HIGH 
THE HOUSE HAD ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS THERE 
YOU THINK SPLITTING THE DIFFERENT AT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THERE IS MORE THAN 
THAT WOULD BE WE WON'T GO THAT HIGH NO 
IT A LITTLE BIT EXTRA A LITTLE OFF HERE A LITTLE SOMETHING THERE 
YOU WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT 
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE 
I KNOW I HAVE THIS CHANCE AND I AM RESISTING THIS TEMPTATION 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING OURSELVES TOGETHER 
THE SPIRIT BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE WAYS AND MEANS AND FINANCE HAS JUST NEVER BEEN BETTER 
IN SEVENTEEN YEARS I'VE NEVER SEEN MORE COOPERATION 
TELL US JUST A FEW THINGS YOU WOULD PAY FOR THIS YOU WOULD USE TO PAY FOR WITH THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FOOD STAMPS URBAN ENTERPRISE ZONES MORE MONEY FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THE BLACK CAUCUS HAS INDICATED THEIR INTERESTS IN THOSE ISSUES AND WE SHARE THAT INTEREST 
THERE ARE TECHNICAL RULES THAT WILL NOT LET US DO EMPOWERMENT ZONES ON THE SENATE SIDE 
SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK FROM CONFERENCE 
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EACH OTHER WE'RE NOT TRYING TO 
EACH OF US ON THE HOUSE AND SENATE SIDE MR. ROSTENKOWSKI SAID IT SO CLEARLY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK TO OUR RESPECTIVE HOUSES A BILL THAT WILL PASS AND WE KNOW WE HAVE NO MARGIN NO CUSHION AND WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERY VOTE WE GOT LAST TIME AND WE WILL 
WELL SPEAKING OF THAT AS YOU KNOW SOME HOUSE DEMOCRATS AND PERHAPS OTHERS ARE CONCERNED THAT ANY INCREASE IN ENERGY TAXES ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DEMOCRATS VULNERABLE WITH MIDDLE CLASS TAX PAYERS 
HOW DO YOU PERSUADE THEM THAT IT'S OKAY TO RAISE TAXES AND TAKE THE HEAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM REPUBLICANS FOR DOING IT 
WE RAISED GASOLINE TAXES A FEW YEARS AGO AND NO ONE EVER HEARD A WORD ABOUT IT 
GASOLINE PRICES ARE THE LOWEST THEY'VE BEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IN REAL TERMS 
THE PRICE AT THE PUMP MORE THAN ANY TAX WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DURING THE COURSE OF NORMAL PRICE CHANGES IN THE YEAR 
NOW LISTEN IT'S GROWN UP TIME 
WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT 
THE INTEREST WE ARE NOW PAYING ON THAT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT WE ADDED IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS 
THAT'S ALMOST THE EQUAL OF THE DEFICIT ITSELF 
INTEREST IS WE'RE BORROWING MONEY TO PAY INTEREST 
IS THERE ANY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD THAT KNOWS YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT 
BUT SENATOR WHAT ABOUT THE NOTIONS THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T RAISE GAS TAXES AS MUCH AS FUEL TAXES BUT INSTEAD YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT OF HIGHER EVEN HIGHER INCOME TAX RATE ON THE UPPER INCOME 
WE'RE DOING I THINK A PRETTY DRAMATIC THING THERE 
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE REVENUE IN THE INCOME TAX CHANGES IN THE SENATE BILL WHICH IS THE LARGEST PART OF THE SENATE BILL EIGHTY PERCENT OF IT COMES FROM HOUSEHOLDS WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR MORE 
I'M SORRY SEVENTY PERCENT 
EIGHTY PERCENT FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR MORE 
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY TAX INCREASE FELT BY PEOPLE IN THE LOWER RANGES 
PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL HAVE A TAX CUT 
JUST QUICKLY SENATOR I WANT TO ASK YOU A REAL QUICK QUESTION 
THAT IS THAT THERE WERE REPORTS TODAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY BE HOLDING BACK IF THIS NEW DEFICIT FORECAST BECAUSE THE PICTURE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ROSIER WHICH WOULD TAKE SOME OF THE INCENTIVE AWAY FOR CUTTING THE DEFICIT SO MUCH 
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS THAT YOU CAN CONFIRM 
IF ANYBODY'S WATCHING ME IN THE VIEW OF THE BUDGET TELL THEM TO KNOCK IT OFF 
I MEAN WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY THIS STRAIGHT 
NO ROSY SCENARIOS 
NO HIDDEN REPORTS 
WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM AND NOW IS THE THREE WEEKS IN WHICH WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO FACE IT 
ALL RIGHT 
WELL SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN WE THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
THANK YOU JUDY
