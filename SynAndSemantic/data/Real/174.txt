NOW JOINING US NOW FOR MORE ON THE SUMMIT IS C. N. N. BUSINESS NEWS CORRESPONDENT BILL HARTLEY 
HE IS IN TOKYO COVERING THE G. SEVEN 
ALL RIGHT BILL OFTEN IN THE PAST THESE ECONOMIC SUMMITS HAVE COME UP WITH NOTHING CONCRETE 
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THIS TIME 
I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AT ALL DIFFERENT STUART AS YOU SAID EARLIER IT'S JUST ONE GIANT PHOTO OPPORTUNITY 
THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY LEADER IS FACED WITH SERIOUS DOMESTIC PROBLEMS AT HOME AND THEY JUST SIMPLY CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
CERTAINLY THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS AND IT'S VERY SAD REALLY IS JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA 
HE IS THE HOST OF THE SUMMIT 
THIS WAS TO BE A GREAT TRIUMPH FOR HIM BUT HIS PARTY RECEIVED A NO CONFIDENCE VOTE 
HE'S A DOZEN DAYS AWAY FROM AN ELECTION 
HE'S VERY MUCH A LAME DUCK PRIME MINISTER ALTHOUGH I PREFER THE JAPANESE PHRASE RATHER MUCH MORE COLORFUL IT MEANS LIVING CORPSE AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT HE IS RIGHT NOW 
WELL BILL THAT'S STRONG STUFF BUT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ECONOMIC SUMMIT 
I TAKE IT YOU'RE TELLING US THAT THERE'S NO ECONOMICS COMING OUT OF THIS 
THIS IS PRIMARILY POLITICAL RIGHT 
OH I THINK DEFINITELY 
THAT'S BEEN TRUE IN THE PAST AS WELL 
THE LEADERS OF THE SEVEN NATIONS JUST ARE NOT ABLE TO REALLY GRASP ONTO THE HARD ECONOMIC ISSUES AND SO THEY TEND TO MOVE OVER INTO THE POLITICAL AREA THAT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR THEM 
THERE'LL BE A PACKAGE FOR RUSSIA NOT AS MUCH AID AS THE U. S. WANTED 
THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE A STRONG STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE URUGUAY ROUND OF TRADE TALKS MUST BE COMPLETED 
THEY COULD HARDLY SAY ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING 
WELL BILL OF THESE CURRENT SEVEN MEMBERS OF THIS G. SEVEN GROUP ARE THEY STILL THE RICHEST AND BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES OR SHOULD SOME OTHER MEMBERS BE ADDED NOW 
WELL THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT SOME SHOULD 
FOR INSTANCE SPAIN IS NOW A MUCH RICHER NATION THAN CANADA BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT REPRESENTED HERE 
THERE'S BEEN AN ARGUMENT THAT THE SOVIET RUSSIA RATHER AND CHINA AS MAJOR ECONOMIC POWERS CERTAINLY NOT DEMOCRACIES BUT MAJOR ECONOMIC POWERS SHOULD ALSO BE ASKED TO JOIN THE GROUP OF SEVEN 
YOU COULD MAKE AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT THAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE GROUP OF SEVEN IS IRRELEVANT RIGHT NOW 
ALL RIGHT BILL HARTLEY LIVE FROM TOKYO REPORTING ON THAT G. SEVEN SUMMIT
