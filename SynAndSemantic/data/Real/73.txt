PEROT INTRODUCED JAMES STOCKDALE AS HIS RUNNING MATE 
THE RETIRED VICE ADMIRAL WHO SPENT NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AS A PRISONER OF WAR IN VIETNAM SAYS THEY'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE PEROT WORKED TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS FOR ALL VIETNAM P. O. W.'S 
C. N. N.'S GREG LEFEVRE TELLS US MORE ABOUT HIM 
JAMES BOND STOCKDALE A CERTIFIED AMERICAN HERO WANTS TO HELP ROSS PEROT SAVE HIS COUNTRY FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT NOW LEADS IT 
IT'S MY HONOR TO BE MY OLD FRIEND ROSS PEROT'S RUNNING MATE IN THIS GREAT EFFORT TO GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AN INDEPENDENT WAY TO GO 
I HAVE A PERSONAL REPUTATION FOR BEING INDEPENDENT IN OUTLOOK AND MANNER SO THIS ROLE GIVES ME ADDED SATISFACTION 
THEN A NAVAL COMMANDER JAMES STOCKDALE LED THE FIRST U. S. BOMBING MISSION ON NORTH VIETNAM IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
SHOT DOWN THE NEXT YEAR THE HIGHEST RANKING OFFICER CAPTURED BY THE NORTH HIS TORTURE AND EIGHT YEAR CAPTIVITY WERE DRAMATIZED IN AN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN T. V. MOVIE 
HIS RELEASE CAME AFTER YEARS OF PRESSURE FROM HIS WIFE'S NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT HIGHLIGHTED PRISON ATROCITIES 
WHENEVER THEY'RE READY TO RECOGNIZE NORTH VIETNAM I OFFER NO OBJECTION TO IT 
SO I'M NOT I DON'T CARRY A LOT OF EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE ON THAT 
STOCKDALE LATER HEADED THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE THEN THE CITADEL IN SOUTH CAROLINA BEFORE RETURNING TO STANFORD AS A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE HOOVER INSTITUTION 
STOCKDALE ALWAYS CONSIDERED HIMSELF A WASHINGTON OUTSIDER THAT IS UNTIL PEROT ANNOUNCED 
NOW HE'S TAKEN THE LID OFF THAT AND HE SAYS I'M GOING BACK THERE AND CLEAN OUT THE BARN 
LAST MARCH PEROT ASKED STOCKDALE TO STAND IN AS VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BECAUSE TWO NAMES ARE NEEDED TO GET ON STATE BALLOTS 
PEROT DROPPED OUT DURING THE SUMMER AND HIS RESURRECTION TODAY HIM FROM CHANGING RUNNING MATES 
SO WHEN I HEARD HIM SAY THAT ON THE TELEVISION SHOW WE SENT HIM A TELEGRAM AND SAID WE'LL GET OUR SHOVELS AND COME WITH YOU ROSS 
ANXIOUS TO RUN THE GAUNTLET OF JOURNALISTS HE BATS BACK QUESTIONS THAT MAY WITHER OTHER CANDIDATES 
HAVE YOU HAD AN AFFAIR 
NUMBER 
HAVE YOU SMOKED MARIJUANA 
NUMBER 
DO THOSE QUESTIONS OFFEND YOU 
NUMBER 
HE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT 
MARRIED FORTY FIVE YEARS THE FIND THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF A PHENOMENON 
PEOPLE LIKE GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT 
I THINK THEY'RE TIRED OF THE SLICK AND THE SHINY AND POLISHED 
I THINK THEY LIKE PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THINGS THEMSELVES 
THEIR DEVOTION TO PEROT IS UNDYING 
WHEN YOU HEAR ROSS SAY HE'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT HE IS EITHER GOING TO DO IT OR BUST A GUT TRYING 
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID 
THAT WAS AND HE NEVER STOPPED TRYING FOR THE P. O. W.'S 
LIFE AND CAREER ARE CERTAINLY THE STUFF OF HOLLYWOOD MOVIES 
EVEN HIS FAVORITE QUOTATION IS HEROIC A LIFE NOT TESTED IS NOT WORTH LIVING 
AND HIS LIFE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TESTED
