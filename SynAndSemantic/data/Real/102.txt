ON BEHALF OF OUR NATION I SALUTE MY PREDECESSOR PRESIDENT BUSH FOR HIS HALF CENTURY OF SERVICE TO AMERICA

MUCH OF THE INAUGURAL IMAGERY IS DEVOTED TO THE QUEST FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

HERE ON THE PULSE OF THIS NEW DAY YOU MAY HAVE THE GRACE TO LOOK UP AND OUT AND INTO YOUR SISTER'S EYES AND INTO YOUR BROTHER'S FACE YOUR COUNTRY AND SAY SIMPLY VERY SIMPLY WITH HOPE GOOD MORNING 
IN HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH PRESIDENT CLINTON INTRODUCED A THEME THAT RARELY IF EVER WAS MENTIONED DURING HIS CAMPAIGN 
HE STRESSED THAT IMPROVING AMERICA AND ITS ECONOMY WILL NOT BE EASY 
IT WILL REQUIRE SACRIFICE BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND DONE FAIRLY NOT CHOOSING SACRIFICE FOR ITS OWN SAKE BUT FOR OUR OWN SAKE 
WE MUST PROVIDE FOR OUR NATION THE WAY A FAMILY PROVIDES FOR ITS CHILDREN 
FROM THIS JOYFUL MOUNTAIN TOP OF CELEBRATION WE HEAR A CALL TO SERVICE IN THE VALLEY 
WE HAVE HEARD THE TRUMPETS WE HAVE CHANGED THE GUARD AND NOW EACH IN OUR OWN WAY AND WITH GOD'S HELP WE MUST ANSWER THE CALL
