NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN TUESDAY FOR THE T. V. RIGHTS TO THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX OLYMPIC GAMES IN ATLANTA 
MANY EXPECT CABLE PROGRAMMING TO PICK UP WHERE A MAJOR BROADCAST NETWORK LEAVES OFF PROVIDING HOURS OF ADDITIONAL COVERAGE 
ALSO TO BE RESOLVED WHICH COUNTRY WILL PLAY HOST IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND 
CHINA COULD BE THE BIG WINNER BUT NOT IF SEVERAL U. S. LAWMAKERS HAVE THEIR WAY 
KATHLEEN KOCH REPORTS 
THIS IS THE PAGEANTRY CHINESE OFFICIALS HOPE TO SEE UNFOLD IN BEIJING'S TIANANMEN SQUARE IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND 
BUT OPPONENTS SAY THAT'S A DISGRACE CONSIDERING THE MASSACRE THERE JUST FOUR YEARS AGO 
I THINK THE OLYMPIC GAMES ARE AN HONOR THAT THE WORLD ON A COUNTRY AND I DON'T THINK THAT HONOR SHOULD BE ON A COUNTRY THAT SYSTEMATICALLY TORTURES AND POLITICAL DISSIDENTS 
BRADLEY A FORMER OLYMPIC ATHLETE HIMSELF HAS INTRODUCED ONE OF TWO NON BINDING CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTIONS URGING REJECTION OF BEIJING'S CANDIDACY 
CHINA CALLS THE MEASURES A WANTON INTERFERENCE WITH THE JUST RIGHT OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE AND UPON OLYMPIC PRINCIPLES 
BEIJING IS SAID TO BE AMONG THE TOP THREE CITIES THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE OR I. O. C. IS CONSIDERING BEFORE IT VOTES ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD 
AT A RECENT HEARING ONE U. S. SENATOR PREDICTED THE RESOLUTIONS COULD BACKFIRE 
THEY WILL GUARANTEE THAT BEIJING GETS THE OLYMPICS THAT OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD WILL NOT REGARD THIS AS AN APPROPRIATE MOVE ON OUR PART AND WILL SHOW THEIR INDEPENDENCE BY DEFYING THIS 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WARNED THE INTERFERENCE COULD JEOPARDIZE THE OLYMPIC HOPES OF AMERICAN CITIES AND ATHLETES 
I THINK WE CANNOT POSSIBLY FORGET THE IMPACT ON THE POTENTIAL AWARDING OF THE GAMES THE WINTER GAMES OF TWO THOUSAND TWO TO SALT LAKE CITY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ME OUR MAJOR CLIENT THE ATHLETES 
SOME FEAR THE DEBATE COULD INTO ANOTHER U. S. BOYCOTT LIKE THAT OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY MOSCOW OLYMPICS 
IT COST ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ATHLETES THE CHANCE TO COMPETE AND IT SPARKED A COUNTER BOYCOTT AGAINST THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR LOS ANGELES SUMMER GAMES 
LAWMAKERS INSIST THAT WON'T HAPPEN THIS TIME 
AND SHOULD THE OLYMPICS COMMITTEE SHOULD BEIJING WE WILL HAVE A FULL DELEGATION THERE 
THE U. S. DELEGATE VOWS THE I. O. C. WILL RESIST ANY PRESSURE 
EACH I. O. C. MEMBER AS PART OF ELECTION TO THE I. O. C. TAKES A SOLEMN OATH TO REMAIN FREE FROM POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL INFLUENCES 
BUT LIKE IT OR NOT POLITICS AND THE OLYMPICS MAY BECOME INTERTWINED AGAIN WITH THE HOUSE AND SENATE'S SCHEDULED VOTES NEXT WEEK ON THE CHINA RESOLUTIONS
