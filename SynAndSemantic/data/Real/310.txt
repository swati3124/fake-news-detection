THE FEDS TALK ABOUT REGULATING CIGARETTES AS A DRUG AND SMOKERS THINK THAT'S A DRAG 
THIS IS C. N. N. AND COMPANY WITH MARY TILLOTSON 
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US 
PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS ALREADY PROPOSED A HUGE INCREASE IN CIGARETTE TAXES NOW THE ANTI TOBACCO FOLKS IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR ATTACK ON NICOTINE SUGGESTING IT IS A DRUG AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION JUST LIKE OTHER DRUGS 
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE LATEST BAD NEWS BOMBARDING SMOKERS ARE NANCY LORD WHO TRAINED AS A DOCTOR AND AN ATTORNEY 
SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY 
IS AN ATTORNEY FOR A GROUP CALLED ACTION ON SMOKING AND HEALTH 
AND SUSAN IS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED SMOKERS' ASSOCIATION 
BET A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS ONE SUSAN 
WE'RE GLAD ALL THREE OF YOU CAN BE WITH US 
AND A QUICK QUESTION QUICK ANSWER TO THE THREE OF YOU TO KICK THIS SHOW OFF 
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BAN CIGARETTES 
NANCY 
WELL IT'S RIDICULOUS 
IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP ANYONE FROM SMOKING AND ALL WE'LL DO IS GET BLACK MARKET CIGARETTES TOXIC POISONOUS NON FILTER 

WE DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY QUESTION OF PROHIBITION BECAUSE THAT HAS VERY BAD LEGAL CONNOTATIONS 
BUT WHAT WE DO BELIEVE IS THAT IT SHOULD BE CONTROLLED TO THE SAME EXTENT AS SELLING GUNS OR SELLING ANY OTHER DANGEROUS DRUG OR EVEN SELLING TOBACCO REMEDIES SUCH AS PATCHES AND TOBACCO CHEWING GUM ARE CONTROLLED 
SUSAN 
NUMBER 
CIGARETTES SHOULD NOT BE BANNED AT ALL 
BECAUSE OF CIGARETTES TWO POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE EMPLOYED CITIZENS 
AND WE DO NEED TO LOOK BACK AT OUR LESSONS THAT HISTORY HAVE SHOWN US THE LESSON OF PROHIBITION THE LESSON OF MCCARTHYISM 
NO IT SHOULD NOT BE BANNED 
NANCY DO YOU SEE ANY IRONY IN THAT JOYCELYN ELDERS THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS SUGGESTED SOME DRUGS THAT ARE NOW CRIMINAL SHOULD BE LEGALIZED 
AND THOUGH SHE HAS NOT SAID SHE WOULD BAN CIGARETTES SHE CERTAINLY HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TOUGHER ON THEM 
ISN'T THE THREAT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME A BLACK MARKET 
EXACTLY 
AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THE EXACT SAME REGULATIONS AS I WOULD WHEN WE DECIDE TO LEGALIZE COCAINE 
WHICH YOU DO FAVOR LET'S TELL EVERYBODY 
YES YES ABSOLUTELY 
AND POT 
EXACTLY 
AND THAT WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE BAN ON ADVERTISING 
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THE JOE CAMEL ADS 
ABSOLUTE BAN ON SALES TO CHILDREN 
AND LOCAL REGULATIONS AS TO WHERE IT CAN BE SOLD 
YOU SAY YOU WOULD SUPPORT SOME REGULATION 
AND I THINK IF ANYTHING THE F. D. A. WOULD PROBABLY LOOK TO CONGRESS TO SET SOME GUIDELINES ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE NICOTINE AND CIGARETTES 
HOW FAR WOULD YOU HAVE THE GOVERNMENT GO WITH REGULATION 
NO MORE OVER THE COUNTER SALES OF CIGARETTES 
NUMBER 
THAT'S SO 
WE BELIEVE THAT IN FACT THE F. D. A. HAS FULL POWER TO DEAL WITH THIS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT 
WE WOULD HAVE IT NO BANNING BUT A PRESCRIPTION 
IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON PRESCRIPTION AS FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN THE CASE OF METHADONE 
THIS WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF LIMITING OR AT LEAST CONTROLLING THE SALE OF CIGARETTES BUT IT WOULD ALSO BE ANOTHER STEP IN KEEPING THEM AWAY FROM CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHAT DOCTOR IS GOING TO PRESCRIBE THEM 
I WAS GOING TO ASK PRESCRIPTION FOR WHAT 
THIS IS LIKE THESE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PUT COCAINE ON PRESCRIPTION 
NO ETHICAL RESPONSIBLE DOCTOR WANTS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESCRIBING NICOTINE OR ANY OTHER DANGEROUS DRUG 
AND WHY DO YOU WANT TO TURN SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE OR MORE IN THIS COUNTRY INTO WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL ADDICTS WHO HAVE TO GO OUT WHICH IS NOW VERY LEGAL 
BUT SUSAN WE ARE ADDICTS THOSE OF US WHO SMOKE 
NO WE ARE NOT 
PART OF WHAT ME IS 
WE ARE 
AS IF IT'S A REVELATION THAT CIGARETTES ARE ADDICTIVE 
WE ARE 
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF IT 
WE ARE ADDICTED 
AND WE'RE ADDICTED WORSE THAN PEOPLE DOING COCAINE AND HEROIN 
THAT IS NOT TRUE 
THAT IS NOT TRUE 
AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN UP THOSE DRUGS WILL TELL YOU THEY CAN GIVE UP THOSE DRUGS FASTER THAN CIGARETTES 
THAT IS NOT TRUE 
A QUESTION A QUESTION TO IF YOU SAY THE F. D. A. HAS FULL POWER RIGHT NOW TO REGULATE CIGARETTES ISN'T THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION CAN IT ONLY BE THAT IF THEY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY THEY SHOULD BE BANNING THOSE THINGS 
YOU SAY WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR THEM 
BUT AS NANCY SAYS WHO WOULD WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR CIGARETTES 
WELL TO BEGIN WITH I THINK ALREADY PRESCRIPTIONS ARE WRITTEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO HEROIN 
WE HAVE METHADONE SITUATION 
WE ALSO HAVE 
BUT THAT'S TO GET THEM OFF A PRESUMABLY WORSE DRUG 
WELL THIS IS THIS IS ALSO TO GET THEM OFF 
BUT ALL THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE SHIFTING ONE ADDICTION TO ANOTHER 
THE OTHER RATHER RIDICULOUS THING IS A DOCTOR HAS TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR A NICOTINE PATCH OR FOR NICOTINE CHEWING GUM 
THEY DON'T CAUSE LUNG CANCER 
AND THIS IS THE THIS IS THE 
THEY DON'T CAUSE LUNG CANCER 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE 
AND WE ALL KNOW THOSE THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO PEOPLE OFF OF THE CIGARETTES THERAPEUTIC PURPOSE 
THE OTHER POINT IS THE OTHER POINT IS I THINK WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH CIGARETTES A DRUG AND A DANGER WHICH IS FAR GREATER THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
CRACK COCAINE TWO THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR 
YES 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SUSAN YOUR TURN 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CIGARETTES DEATH A YEAR 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU SEE MUGGING LITTLE OLD LADIES ON THE STREET SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND BUY PACKS OF CIGARETTES 
NOW YOU WANT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ADDICTION A CIGARETTE SMOKER FINDS THEIR LEVEL THAT THEY WANT TO SMOKE 
I GO THROUGH APPROXIMATELY TWO PACKS OF CIGARETTES A DAY 
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS 
YOU TELL ME THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH TWO LINES OF COKE A DAY OR TWO HITS OF CRACK A DAY WHEN THEY'RE ADDICTED 
THEY DO WITH THEY DO WITH HEROIN 
THE DOCTOR 
HEROIN ADDICTS CAN GET THEIR LEVEL AND STAY THERE 
COCAINE ADDICTS YOU'RE RIGHT THEY TEND TO GO UP 
BUT THE REASON PEOPLE AREN'T MUGGING EACH OTHER OVER CIGARETTES IS THAT CIGARETTES ARE LEGAL 
EXACTLY 
IF YOU MADE THEM ILLEGAL WE'D BE GETTING SHOT OVER THEM TOO 
YES NOW YOU'VE JUST MADE AN EXCELLENT POINT 
WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS 
WHY SHOULD WE MAKE SOMETHING LEGAL 
WHY SHOULD WE SUDDENLY TURN TWO POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE WHO EARN LEGAL INCOMES AND TURN THAT INCOME OVER TO A BLACK MARKET 
SUSAN I'LL AGREE WITH YOU 
I'M JUST SAYING LET'S REGULATE IT AS MUCH AS WE CAN BECAUSE THE F. D. A. DOES TECHNICALLY HAVE THE POWER 
THE WAY THE F. D. A. HAS EXPANDED THEIR POWER TO VITAMINS AND FOODS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THERE IS NO LEGAL REASON THEY CANNOT REGULATE OR BAN NICOTINE 
IT IS A DRUG JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE 
I WANT TO LET 
BUT 
GO AHEAD NANCY 
SORRY 
IF WE CAN BAN IT WE CAN REGULATE IT 
AND LET'S PUT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE SO THAT WHEN WE'RE READY TO STOP PROHIBITING ANY TYPE OF DRUG BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IS NONSENSE WE'LL HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAT WORK 
AND THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE BAN ON SALES TO CHILDREN ABSOLUTE BAN ON ADVERTISING AND CIVIL PENALTIES AND ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR PEOPLE THAT GET IN TROUBLE WITH THEM 
I WANT TO LET IN VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THIS IS CERTAINLY BEYOND A LEGAL QUESTION A MEDICAL QUESTION IT'S A POLITICAL QUESTION TOO 
YOU'VE GOT QUITE A POWERFUL TOBACCO LOBBY IN THE UNITED STATES 
IS IT POSSIBLE AS I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THEORIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EVEN HINTS AT THE SPECTER OF REGULATING OR BANNING CIGARETTES BECAUSE THAT MAY MAKE THEIR VERY EXPENSIVE EXCISE TAX ON CIGARETTES MORE PALATABLE THAT THEY'LL GO TO THE TOBACCO LOBBY AND THEY'LL SAY LOOK THIS IS THE WORST NEWS 
THIS IS WHAT WE COULD DO TO YOU 
SO ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAX A PACK OF CIGARETTES SEVENTY FIVE CENTS MORE 
WELL ACTION ON SMOKING AND HEALTH HAS HAD CONSIDERABLE INPUT INTO PRESIDENT CLINTON'S SUGGESTIONS FOR HEALTH 
AND THIS IS THE ONE WE THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURE OF ALL 
WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING EVERY YEAR AS A RESULT OF CIGARETTE SMOKING 
NOT TRUE 
AND WE HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND NON SMOKERS DYING EVERY YEAR 
NOT TRUE 
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OTHER OTHER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OTHER DEATHS FOR EXAMPLE FROM GUNS FIREARMS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND 
SO WE ARE TALKING WHERE THE REALLY POLITICAL FIGURES ARE THE NUMBER OF LIVES INVOLVED 
NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF LIVES INVOLVED WHEN PEOPLE DIE BUT ALSO THE YEARS AND YEARS OF ILLNESS AND LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY 
NOW SUSAN IS VERY FRUSTRATED 
SUSAN YOU WANT TO TELL US THAT CIGARETTES ARE GOOD FOR US RIGHT 
NO I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT AT ALL 
I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING WHAT IS OR IS NOT GOOD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL 
I THINK EVERYBODY IS VERY INDIVIDUAL 
WE ARE ADULTS 
LET'S NOT UNDERESTIMATE OUR INTELLIGENCE HERE 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ADVERTISING 
ADVERTISING DOESN'T ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO TO TO BEGIN WITH 
WELL 
AND YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ALLEGED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT DIE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE I MEAN THAT IS A FABRICATION OF AN ANTI MIND 
THAT HAS THAT NUMBER HAS NOT BEEN SANCTIONED BY ANYBODY NOT EVEN THE E. P. A. 
IT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY BY 
THEN BOY IS CORPORATE AMERICAN WASTING A LOT OF MONEY IF ADS DON'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON PEOPLE 
NANCY YOU'RE A DOCTOR 
YOU TRAINED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD OF CIGARETTE SMOKING AND WHY IF IT KILLS AS MANY PEOPLE AS SAYS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT MADE THE SAME SORTS OF STRIDES TOWARD HELPING PEOPLE GET OFF THAT ADDICTION AS THEY HAVE TOWARD TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO GET PEOPLE OFF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS 
WAIT WAIT MARY MARY I DISAGREE WITH YOUR ASSUMPTION 
WHAT HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DONE TO GET PEOPLE OFF COCAINE 
BY MAKING IT ILLEGAL WE'VE CREATED THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW ADDICTS AS DEALERS PUSH IT ON THE STREETS 
WE'D GET THE SAME THING WITH CIGARETTES 
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HOW BAD IT IS HAS NO RELEVANCE TO WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BAN IT BECAUSE PROHIBITION DOESN'T WORK 
IN FACT IT HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT 
CIGARETTES HAVING BEEN LEGAL FEWER PEOPLE SMOKE 
THOSE OF US WHO DO AND I ALSO SMOKE SMOKE LOW TAR CIGARETTES WE SMOKE LESS FREQUENTLY 
BUT WHEN YOU PROHIBIT SOMETHING YOU GET IT IN ITS MOST POTENT AND TOXIC FORM 
THAT'S WHY WE WENT FROM VERY WEAK AND MILD COCAINE IN THE SEVENTIES TO CRACK COCAINE AND HEROIN NOW IN THE NINETIES 
AND THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN WITH CIGARETTES IF WE BAN IT OR TAX IT TO THE POINT THAT A BLACK MARKET CAN WORK WHICH IS ALREADY 
WELL WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING IT SHOULD BE BANNED WE ARE SUGGESTING IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY ON PRESCRIPTION 
SO WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING 
PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO REASON FOR PRESCRIPTION FOR A RECREATIONAL PRODUCT 
THE DOCTORS ARE TO TREAT DISEASE 
IF SOMEONE IS HEALTHY AND CHOOSES TO USE A PRODUCT WHETHER IT'S MARIJUANA TOBACCO COCAINE OR HEROIN THERE IS NO REASON TO GET A DOCTOR INVOLVED 
ALL THAT HAPPENED IN ENGLAND WHEN THEY HAD DOCTORS PRESCRIBING HEROIN WAS THAT SOME UNETHICAL DOCTORS GOT RICH HOLDING SURGERIES IN THE SUBWAY STATIONS 
BUT NONETHELESS YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THE HEROIN PROBLEM IN BRITAIN IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK ON THAT POINT 
THAT'S MORE CULTURAL 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK ON THAT POINT 
NANCY I WANT TO PURSUE WITH YOU ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS NOT AN EMPHASIS ON TREATMENT 
CERTAINLY COMPARED TO CIGARETTES I THINK THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY 
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT JOE CAMEL WHEN WE COME BACK 
STAY WITH US 
THOSE ARE THE ADS THAT HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE CIGARETTES BENT OUT OF SHAPE 
JOE CAMEL ADS AND SUPPOSEDLY INCLUDING YOUNG WOMEN CAMELS THAT APPEAL TO TEENAGE GIRLS 
SUSAN YOU SAY THAT HAS NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER ON CREATING A NEW MARKET OF CIGARETTE SMOKERS FOR THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
NO IT DOES NOT 
AND IF CHILDREN ARE SO COMPELLED BY CARTOON FIGURES THEN YOU'D HAVE CHILDREN TELLING MOM THAT THEY'VE GOT TO CLEAN WITH MR. CLEAN THEY'VE GOT TO GET WHITE CLOUD BATHROOM TISSUE 
SPEEDY IS A CARTOON CHARACTER 
YOU DON'T SEE KIDS RUSHING OUT AND BUYING 
AND IF CHILDREN ARE SO IMPELLED BY CARTOON CHARACTERS THEN WHY AREN'T THEY EATING SPINACH BECAUSE OF THREE TIMES A DAY OR EATING CARROTS WITH EVERY MEAL BECAUSE OF BUGS BUNNY 
I ALWAYS ATE SPINACH BECAUSE OF 
WELL IF THESE ADS HAVE AS LITTLE IMPACT AS YOU SAY WHY IS THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY OUT OF SHAPE ABOUT BANNING THEM 
THEY DON'T PERSUADE ANYBODY TO SMOKE RIGHT 
ABSOLUTELY 
ONE CAN ALSO ASK WHY THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY SPENDS TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN ADVERTISING 
OH I KNOW 
THEY THINK IT DOES SOMETHING FOR THEM DON'T THEY 
GO AHEAD NANCY 
PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED BY THAT 
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGHTING THE DRUG WAR MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE BY SAYING THAT THE JOE CAMEL ADS ARE O. K. 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING WE SHOULD NOT BAN AND REGULATE TOBACCO AND SAYING THE JOE CAMEL ADS ARE O. K. 
OF COURSE CARTOON CHARACTERS ARE USED TO PROMOTE SALES TO KIDS 
AND IF YOU NOTICE THE NEXT GENERATION WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A TEENAGER WE ALL SMOKED MARLBOROS 
THAT WAS THE COOL CIGARETTE TO SMOKE 
AND THEN NOW THE KIDS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ALL SMOKE CAMELS 
IT WORKED 
THEY GOT A WHOLE GENERATION SMOKING THEIR BRAND 
CAMELS USED TO BE THE CIGARETTES YOUR PARENTS SMOKED 
AND THE OTHER RATHER FRIGHTFUL THING I THINK WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY RECORDED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE IS THAT THEY FOUND NINE YEAR OLD CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY JOE CAMEL WHAT HE STOOD FOR TO THE SAME EXTENT THEY COULD MICKEY MOUSE 
RIGHT 
THAT'S TRUE 
SO I THINK THEN THIS IS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING A NEW GENERATION COMING UP ADDICTED AND 
THEY ALSO RECOGNIZED SNOOPY IN TOO 
SUSAN I WANT TO ASK YOU I WOULD HAVE TO THINK MUCH MORE THAN ANY ASSAULT ON JOE CAMEL OR WHATEVER THE FEMALE JOE CAMEL VERSION IS CALLED SOMETHING THAT WORRIES THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY A GREAT DEAL MORE WAS RON KESSLER SUGGESTING IN A LETTER THIS WEEK DAVID KESSLER WHO IS WITH FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT TOBACCO COMPANIES CIGARETTE COMPANIES ARE IN EFFECT DOCTORING CIGARETTES TO INCREASE BOOST THE NICOTINE LEVEL SO AS TO KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS ADDICTED 
ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE WAY AROUND 
THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS ARE REDUCING THE NICOTINE IN TOBACCO 
YOUR AVERAGE TOBACCO HAS TWO POINT FIVE TO THREE POINT FIVE MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR BLEND 
I'VE GOT SOME TOBACCO ADVERTISING RIGHT HERE 
ONE POINT ONE ONE POINT TWO MILLIGRAMS 
THE NICOTINE IS REDUCED IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS 
THERE'S 
IT IS REDUCED AND THEN IT IS RESTORED 
EXCUSE ME 
MAY I FINISH 
EXCUSE ME 
BY LAW THEY HAVE TO STATE HOW MUCH NICOTINE IS IN THEIR FINISHED PRODUCT 
THOSE ARE IN THE ADVERTISING 
NOW THERE ARE NATURAL CIGARETTE PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE DONE BY AMERICAN INDIANS 
THEY ARE PURE THEY PICK THE LEAF THEY DRY IT THEY PUT IT IN PAPER 
THOSE ARE MUCH HIGHER IN NICOTINE LEVELS BECAUSE TOBACCO ITSELF HAS THAT NICOTINE LEVEL 
THE CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS ARE REDUCING THAT NICOTINE LEVEL 
WELL TO GET TO THE POINT I WANT TO STICK WITH SUSAN JUST A SECOND THEN WE'LL LET YOU IN 
TO STICK THE POINT THAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT IF YOU HAVE THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION CONTENDING THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE NO MATTER SUSAN WHAT YOU SAY THAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES ARE BOOSTING THAT ADDICTIVE LEVEL OF NICOTINE DOESN'T THAT PROVIDE A PRETTY POWERFUL WEAPON FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO INTO COURT WITH A PRODUCT LIABILITY SUIT AGAINST CIGARETTE COMPANIES 
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND HERE THAT TOBACCO IS NOT THE ONLY PLANT IN THE FAMILY 
YOU'VE GOT EGGPLANT YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT TOMATOES YOU'VE GOT POTATOES YOU'VE GOT GREENS 
YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT NICOTINE IN ONE SUBSTANCE DO IT WITH EVERYTHING 
YOU WANT TO REGULATE NICOTINE THE F. D. A. THEN YOU'VE GOT TO REGULATE THE PURCHASE AND THE PERSONAL GROWTH OF VEGETABLES IN YOUR GARDEN 
LET'S LET IN ON THIS POINT 
YOU SEE THAT LETTER FROM THE F. D. A. AND OPENING UP THAT CAN OF WORMS AS POTENTIALLY A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON IN PRODUCT LIABILITY SUITS AGAINST CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS 
I CERTAINLY DID 
AND AS A RESULT OF THIS ORGANIZATION YET ANOTHER PETITION 
WE DID ONE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO AS WELL TO HAVE TOBACCO DECLARED A DRUG PARTICULARLY SINCE IT IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT CAN BE WHEN IT'S USED AS DIRECTED WILL CAUSE ILLNESS AND DEATH 
NOW AS TO THIS QUESTION OF ADDING NICOTINE OUR FRIEND SAYS QUITE RIGHTLY THAT THE NICOTINE IS TAKEN OUT 
IT IS THEN RESTORED PUT IN AND FORTIFIED 
NOR ARE THESE THE ONLY DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN TOBACCO 
RECENT LAW CASES HAVE REVEALED THAT PESTICIDES THAT ARE SPRAYED ON THE TOBACCO LEAVES AND THAT ARE THEN SWEPT UP AND RECYCLED AND PUT INTO THE TOBACCO PRODUCT ALSO PROVIDE A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY DANGEROUS CHEMICALS 
SO THE CHEMICALS COME FROM 
AGAIN NOBODY IS DISPUTING THAT SMOKING TOBACCO IS VERY BAD FOR YOU AND THERE'S A LOT OF BAD THINGS IN IT 
OH I THOUGHT SUSAN WAS 
I DON'T THINK SO 
I DON'T THINK SHE'S JUST DISPUTING US ON THE ADS 
I THINK WHAT WE'RE DISPUTING IS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN LEGAL NOW FOREVER 
AND WE HAVE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SMOKERS JUST LIKE WE'VE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DRINKERS 
PEOPLE DON'T DRINK AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO AND THEY TEND TO DRINK LIGHT WINE 
GOVERNMENT PROHIBITION AND REGULATION INCREASES USE AND INCREASES THE POTENCY OF THE PRODUCT 
AND THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN IN THE CASE OF CIGARETTES IF THEY ARE EITHER PROHIBITED OR REGULATED TO THE POINT THAT THEY BECOME DIFFICULT TO GET 
THAT IS CORRECT 
TWO MAIN THINGS I THINK HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE 
BUT HANG ON TO JUST A SECOND 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK 
YOU GET TO SAY YOUR TWO MAIN THINGS WHEN WE COME BACK 
STAY WITH US 
WHEN A YOUNG PERSON STARTS TO USE TOBACCO IT IS A SIGNAL AN ALARM THAT HE OR SHE MAY GET INVOLVED IN OTHER RISKY BEHAVIOR 
WELCOME BACK TO OUR LAST FEW MINUTES 
AND SUSAN IT REALLY IS ONLY A FEW MINUTES 
SO PLEASE YOU NANCY NO 
I WANT TO TRY AND SQUEEZE ALL OF YOU IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES 
SUSAN WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SMOKERS BANNED IN A LOT OF RESTAURANTS A LOT OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
DO YOU THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TIGHTEN THOSE SCREWS EVEN MORE GIVEN THE CURRENT DEBATE 
WELL YOU KNOW THEY'RE CUTTING THEIR OWN THROATS IF THEY DO 
IF THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO FUND YOU KNOW THE CLINTONS' HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON EXCISE TAXES YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE POINT 
IT'S LIKE OH LET'S TAKE AWAY HERE AND GIVE HERE 
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY HERE TO DO WHAT 
WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS DEBATE ABOUT NEW REGULATION OF CIGARETTES GOING 
I CERTAINLY THINK THE F. D. A. WILL AT LAST TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLASSIFY TOBACCO AS A DRUG THE ONLY PRODUCT WHICH USED WHEN DIRECTED WHICH CAUSES DEATH AND INJURY ON A VAST SCALE 
I WANT TO ASK VERY VERY QUICKLY BEFORE WE GO TO NANCY WHO SHOULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR CIGARETTES AND WHO SHOULD WRITE THAT PRESCRIPTION UNDER YOUR THEORY 
UNDER MY THEORY ONE WOULD GO TO A DOCTOR JUST AS ONE GOES FOR DIABETES INSULIN PRESCRIPTION OR CASE OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS 
AND AN ADULT SMOKER WHO MAY WELL BE CONSIDERED ADDICTED SHOULD GO 
NANCY WE'LL LET YOU IN 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS DEBATE IS GOING TO GO 
I THINK IT'S PART OF A BROADER AND REALLY SCARY DEBATE ABOUT GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF OUR LIVES 
IT INCLUDES THE UPCOMING CONTROL OF VITAMINS 
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THEM ON PRESCRIPTION 
SOCIALIZED MEDICINE PUTTING YOUR HEALTH RECORDS ON A HEALTH SECURITY CARD FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
AND UNLESS WE REALLY GET TOGETHER AND SAY HEY GOVERNMENT THIS IS NOT YOUR AFFAIR 
LEAVE US ALONE 
THESE ARE PERSONAL DECISIONS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE FOR OURSELVES AND BY OURSELVES WE COULD HAVE A REALLY UGLY COUNTRY 
AND YOU'VE GOT THE LAST WORD 
WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THREE OF YOU BEING WITH US TODAY 
THANK YOU MARY 
NANCY LORD SUSAN 
WE ARE APPRECIATIVE THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE JOINED US TOO 
I'M MARY TILLOTSON 
NOW HERE'S BOBBIE BATTISTA WITH A LOOK AT WHAT'S COMING UP
