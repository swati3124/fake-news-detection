THE STANDOFF MADE WACO TEXAS A HOUSEHOLD NAME 
JOINING ME IS THE CITY'S MAYOR BOB 
MR. MAYOR WE JUST HEARD A FAMILY MEMBER SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THIS HAPPENED 
I'M WONDERING AS YOU HAVE LIVED WITH THIS CULT FOR SOME TIME HOW YOU ARE FEELING ON THIS DAY THAT IT HAS ENDED AND ARE YOU SURPRISED HOW IT ENDED 
I CERTAINLY AM SURPRISED 
I LISTENED TO THE REPORTS AS WE WENT ALONG AND I BELIEVE EVERYBODY WAS PRAYING AND HOPING THAT IT WOULD BE A PEACEFUL END NO MORE BLOODSHED 
I WAS SHOCKED THIS MORNING OR AT NOON WHEN I SAW THE FLAMES AND SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
I KEPT HOPING LIKE I THINK EVERYONE IN OUR CITY DID THAT SOMEHOW THEY WERE IN BUNKERS THEY WERE NOT BEING CONSUMED 
IT'S A VERY TRAGIC END TO IT 
WELL YOU SAY YOU WERE SHOCKED AROUND NOON WHEN YOU SAW THE FIRE 
I'M WONDERING DID THE F. B. I. INFORM YOU THIS MORNING 
DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE BEGINNING A TACTIC TO MOVE IN TO PREPARE ANY RESCUE CREWS IN YOUR CITY 
ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE CITY MANAGER CALLED ME AND LET ME KNOW THAT HE HAD RECEIVED WORD AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS DIRECTLY FROM THE F. B. I. THAT HE'D RECEIVED WORD THAT THE F. B. I. WAS PROCEEDING AGAINST THE COMPOUND 
HE HAD NO DETAILS AT THAT TIME 
AND WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY 
HOW ARE THEY FEELING TODAY 
TO BE HONEST I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH CHANCE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY 
I HAVE BEEN MORE AT CITY HALL 
WE'RE TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE NEXT DAY AND SO WHAT I THE PEOPLE I HAVE TALKED TO IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THE LOSS OF LIFE 
I AM FAMILY MAN WITH SIX CHILDREN AND SIX GRANDCHILDREN 
IT'S JUST TOTALLY BEYOND ME THAT THIS KIND OF THING COULD HAVE OCCURRED 
AND HOW DOES THE CITY RECOVER FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE PEOPLE INDIVIDUALS THE NEIGHBORS AND ON A WHOLE 
YOUR IMAGE 
OUR IMAGE IS WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE EVENTS THAT COME SUCH AS THIS 
OUR IMAGE HAS BEEN A CITY OF CARING PEOPLE OF FRIENDLY MOST OF THE NEWS MEDIA HAVE BEEN AWFUL NICE TO SAY THAT WE'RE A GOOD CITY 
WE WERE THAT KIND OF CITY BEFORE HAVE BEEN THAT KIND OF CITY DURING THE WHOLE TIME AND WE'LL BE THAT KIND IN THE FUTURE 
I'M SURE IT'LL HANG ON FOR A WHILE BUT I THINK IN THE FUTURE WE'LL BE BACK TO THE SAME REPUTATION WE HAD BEFORE 
AND DID YOU TALK WITH ONE OF THE SURVIVORS AS SHE WAS TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL 
NUMBER 
I DID NOT 
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF THE SURVIVORS 
O. K. 
HELP US 
YOU SAY THE CITY CAN RECOVER BUT SPECIFICALLY HOW DO YOU DO THAT AFTER SUCH A LOSS OF LIFE THERE 
THAT'S THE HARD THING 
WE HAVE DURING THE ENTIRE STANDOFF HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING AMONG THE STAFF AND THE CHAMBER AND EVERYONE HOW DO WE COME OUT AND MAKE IT THE BEST OF IT 
THIS KIND OF TRAGIC END WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO 
NEEDLESS TO SAY WE'LL GO ON DOING THE THINGS WE'VE DONE ALL THROUGH THE YEARS 
WE'VE HAD TRAGEDIES HERE BEFORE 
WE HAD A TORNADO THAT KILLED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
WE CAME OUT AS A CITY STRONGER MORE UNITED 
SOMETIMES ADVERSITY BRINGS YOU MORE TOGETHER AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO LOOK AT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN OUT OF THIS 
MAYOR BOB OF WACO TEXAS WE THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH US
