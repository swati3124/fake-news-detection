WE'RE CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATION ON WHETHER OR NOT ROGUES MAKE BETTER POLITICIANS THAN SAINTS 
NOW DURING THIS DEBATE LAST NIGHT AT OXFORD WHO WON 
ROGUES OF COURSE TWO TO ONE WE TROUNCED THEM 
EASILY 
YOU WERE PRO SAINT WHAT'S YOU'RE RESPONSE TO THAT 
NO I HAVE MY VIEW IS I WANTED TO BE THERE WHEN THE SAINTS WENT MARCHING OUT AND I STUCK TO THAT 
AND WE RETIRED IN REASONABLY GOOD ORDER 
AND I SAID LOOK STAY WITH THE SAINTS BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE VULNERABLE 
YOU CAN ATTACK THE SAINTS 
PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THE SAINT 
THEY MAY TRUST A ROGUE BECAUSE THE WORD ROGUE IF YOU NOTICE IN JOURNALISM IS NEVER USED WITHOUT THE WORD LIKABLE WHICH IS A VERY VERY SUSPICIOUS WORD 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD LIKABLE ESPECIALLY WHEN ATTACHED TO THE WORD ROGUE REACH FOR YOUR WHATEVER PROTECTIVE GEAR YOU HAPPEN TO BE USING 
DON'T BUY A CAR FROM THIS MAN 
BUT THE VOTE WENT FOR THE ARGUMENT THAT THE ISSUE WAS LEADERSHIP OR NO LEADERSHIP 
IT WAS A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT ONE HAD THE SKILL TO MAKE THE IMPORTANT CHANGES AND THE IMPORTANT POLICY THAT IS NECESSARY AS OPPOSED TO HAVING NO LEADERSHIP BUT A BLAMELESS PRIVATE LIFE 
WELL I'M JUST GOING TO BUTT IN 
IF VANITY FAIR BROUGHT YOU ALL OVER HERE AND SPONSORED THIS DEBATE OBVIOUSLY IT'S BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY LIKES TO TALK ABOUT 
I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING WE ALL FIND INTERESTING 
BUT SERIOUSLY IN OUR HEARTS OF HEARTS LOOKING AT THE GENERAL VOTERS DO YOU THINK JUST TO CHANGE THIS A BIT DO YOU THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY AMERICANS PERCEIVE THIS THAN BRITONS 
I THINK AMERICANS ARE MUCH MORE HYPOCRITICAL AND PURITANICAL THAN THE BRITS ON THIS 
BUT YOU KNOW LOOK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE'VE DEALT WITH IT IN OUR OWN HISTORY 
NOW THE TRUTH IS THAT FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT HAD WHAT BY TODAY'S RIGHTS WOULD BE AN ARRANGEMENT NOT A REAL MARRIAGE AS WE WOULD SAY TODAY 
BUT YET IT WAS THE MOST FRUITFUL PARTNERSHIP IN AMERICAN HISTORY BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND A WIFE 
TODAY WE HAVE A BLAMELESS CHARACTER AND HIS WIFE THE MOST BELOVED FIGURE IN AMERICA TODAY HE USES HER AS A POLITICAL HUMAN SHIELD WHEREVER HE GOES 
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT CHARACTER 
AND WHAT POSITIVE EFFECT HAS ANY OF THIS HAD 
THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE AND WE HAVE DEALT WITH IT IN OUR HISTORY AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR OWN HISTORY 
ALL RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
WELL BECAUSE I'M AN ENGLISH EXILE LIVING IN AMERICA I FEEL RELUCTANT TO SAY BUT ACTUALLY DO THINK THAT THE ENGLISH ARE SLIGHTLY MORE GROWN UP ABOUT IT 
I MEAN IN OTHER WORDS YOU MENTION AND MAJOR EARLIER ONE COULD HAVE ADDED PADDY SP WHO'S THE ONLY PARTY LEADER TO HAVE GOT INTO A SPOT OF BOTHER ON THE MORALITY FRONT 
SO HIS FIGURES IF I CAN STILL EMPLOY THE EXPRESSION SHOOT UP ON THAT BASIS 
NOW THAT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAPPEN IN AMERICA 
THERE'D BE A LOT WISE NODDING AND ABOUT THIS AND A LOT OF PULLING OF THE CHIN ABOUT POLITICAL CANDIDATES CANNOT BE TRUSTED 
THE FACT IS THAT WHEN I MEANT WHAT I SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE BANANA OF POLITICS THAT'S GOING ON NOW 
IN A BANANA REPUBLIC YOU'RE CONSTANTLY REASSURED BY PICTURES OF THE LEADER WITH HIS FAMILY WITH HIS CHILDREN WITH HIS ANIMALS WHO ARE BEING PATTED AND SO ON 
THE ILLUSION IS HE LIVES JUST LIKE YOU DO 
BUT YOU DON'T IN FACT HAVE A SECURE STABLE FAMILY LIFE EITHER BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING IN A BANANA REPUBLIC THAT HAS A RATHER TYRANNICAL PERSON ON TOP OF IT 
SO IT'S A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF AND HYPOCRISY 
I HAVE TO INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO CONCLUDE HERE 
VERY BRIEFLY 
I WAS JUST HITTING MY STRIDE 
VERY BRIEFLY IT ALMOST SEEMS THAT YOU'RE ARGUING AGAINST THE SAINTS AS STRONGLY AS YOU'RE ARGUING AGAINST THE ROGUES 
SAINTS COULDN'T IN THAT WAY SEE 
SAINTS WOULD SAY I COME BEFORE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO'S SUFFERED SOMEONE WHO HAS PURIFIED THROUGH STRUGGLE SOMEONE WHO CAN'T BE IMPEACHED IN THESE WAYS AND SO ON 
IT WOULD SET AN IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD 
IT WOULD NOT BE PEOPLE BEING ENLISTED IN A COLLECTIVE LIE WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US NOW 
DEPRESSING THOUGHT 
WELL WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE LIVE IN A FALLEN STATE IN A WAY 
AND THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE CHANGES IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THESE REALITIES WHAT'S HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF NOT DEALING WITH THEM IS THAT WE SEE THEM MANIPULATED 
AND POLITICS ITSELF HAS BECOME TOXIC SO THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH ANYTHING AND SEEKING AFTER FALSE 
WELL ON THAT NOTE GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
