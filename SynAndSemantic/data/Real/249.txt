IF YOU HAVE A BURNING DESIRE TO VISIT THE HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS BETTER NOT STAND AROUND VERY LONG 
THE HOTEL THAT GANGSTERS BUILT WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ON THE NEXT NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES 
C. N. N.'S ANN MCDERMOTT EXPLAINS 
IN THE BEGINNING THE CITY OF WAS SOMEWHAT SEDATE 
LAS VEGAS NEVADA THE ENTERTAINMENT AND FUN CAPITAL OF THE WORLD WHERE BLUE JEANS AND MINK ARE A COMMON SIGHT SIDE BY SIDE 
THEN THERE WAS GLITZ INCREDIBLY GARISH GLITZ 
AND TODAY LAS VEGAS SAYS LET THERE BE LIONS AND CASTLES PYRAMIDS AND PIRATES 
YUP LAS VEGAS IS CHANGING AGAIN 
FOR ONE THING IT'S GETTING BIGGER 
IN THE NEXT TEN WEEKS ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND HOTEL ROOMS WILL BE BUILT HERE 
THE M. G. M. WILL BOAST FIVE THOUSAND ROOMS ALONE 
BUT THEY WON'T ALL BE HOUSING GAMBLERS 
FAMILIES WILL FILL THEM UP TOO THANKS TO AN ADJACENT THEME PARK 
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE VEGAS IS ATTRACTING THESE DAYS THE KIND VETERAN AND ROY HAVE ALWAYS ATTRACTED 
LAS VEGAS IS THE DISNEY LAND OF THE ADULTS AND NOW IT IS THE DISNEY LAND OF CHILDREN AS WELL 
MCDERMOTT BUT IN MAKING WAY FOR THE NEW LAS VEGAS IS A LOT OF THE OLD LIKE THE LAST BUILDING OF THE OLD HOTEL 
IT'LL BE AND REPLACED NEVER MIND THAT IT'S THE HOUSE THAT BUGSY BUILT OR MR. SIEGEL AS HE WAS SOMETIMES CALLED 
A SAYS THAT'S TEARING DOWN A BIT OF HISTORY 
WHY BECAUSE A GANGSTER LIVED THERE 
WELL SURE 
LIKE CHICAGO TRIED TO MAKE AL HOUSE A HISTORIC LANDMARK 
BUT LAS VEGAS IS ABOUT NEWNESS AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE SAYS OLD HAS GOT TO GO 
DOES THE CORPORATION FEEL ANY KIND OF PANG AT ALL OR MAYBE I'M BEING NAIVE OVER LOSING AN IMPORTANT PART OF ITS PAST 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
WELL HE'S NOT ALONE HERE 
EVEN VISITORS SEEMED EAGER TO RING OUT THE OLD 
I THINK IT'S GREAT A LOT OF NEW HOTELS A LOT BIGGER HOTELS 
A LOT MORE CASINOS TO LOSE YOUR MONEY AT 
YOU MIGHT THINK THIS VETERAN VEGAS SIGN MAKER WHO SOMETIMES WANDERS THROUGH HIS NEON GRAVEYARD MIGHT GET A LITTLE SENTIMENTAL SAY OVER THE IMMINENT DESTRUCTION 
AFTER ALL THAT BEEN A CENTERPIECE OF THE CITY FOR YEARS 
BUT WHAT THE HECK THAT WAS YESTERDAY 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE BLOWING UP THE DUNES I GUESS VERY SOON 
RIGHT 
IS THAT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY KIND OF A PANG 
NUMBER 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH 

A SOMEWHAT COLD BUNCH THESE LAS OR MAYBE IT'S JUST SELF PROTECTION 
AFTER ALL WHY GET ATTACHED TO THINGS HERE 
IT'LL ALL JUST CHANGE AGAIN RIGHT PAL
