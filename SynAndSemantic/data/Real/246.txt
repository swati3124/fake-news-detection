WHETHER IT'S A POPULAR JAPANESE IMPORT OR AN ALL AMERICAN CLASSIC NEW CARS FOR NINETY FOUR MEAN UPDATED LOOKS FOR SOME FAVORITES ON FOUR WHEELS 
C. N. N.'S ED GARSTEN TAKES US THROUGH DETROIT SHOWROOMS 
YOU WON'T FIND THE NINETY FOUR MUSTANG IN YOUR LOT UNTIL DECEMBER BUT ALREADY THE REDESIGNED SPORT PONIES ARE BEING BY ANXIOUS BUYERS LIKE JEANNE FITZGERALD 
LIKE HOW SLEEK IT IS 
I LIKE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE ROOF LINE AND THE WAY THEY STILL INCORPORATED SOME OF THE STYLING FROM THE OLD MUSTANG 
THOSE OF US WHO LIKE THE TESTOSTERONE SEGMENT ARE VERY VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT THE MUSTANG AND THE AND WHICH WERE INTRODUCED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WARM OUR HEARTS 
THE OF THE MUSTANG INTO NINETY FOUR A HERD OF NEW VEHICLES WILL BE BUYING FOR ATTENTION ESPECIALLY CHRYSLER'S NEW SMALL CAR THE NEON 
WHILE THE PRICE HASN'T BEEN REVEALED CHRYSLER SAYS THE NEON STICKER WILL LIGHT THE EYES OF ENTRY LEVEL BUYERS 
AND SO FAR IT'S LIT THE EYES OF AUTO CRITICS WINNING BEST OF SHOW AT FRANKFURT GERMANY 
OTHER CARS TURNING HEADS IN NINETY FOUR THE TOYOTA AND THE HONDA ACCORD THE CHEVY S. TEN PICKUP TRUCK PLUS A FEW THAT WILL BE SOON INTRODUCED 
THE OR AS IT'S KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT THE U. S. THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY S. X. 
AND A SMALL CAR FROM FORD STILL UNDER WRAPS THE ASPIRE 
THE ASPIRE IS A SMALL CAR 
IT'S A CAR THAT HAS A RETAIL PRICE FOR A BABY TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
BUT WHAT MANY CAR BUYERS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN HAS NOTHING TO WITH SIZE OR COLOR 
INDEED SAFETY IS A MAIN CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR 
I FIND IT VERY IMPORTANT 
I'M DOING A LOT DRIVING 
I'M IN SALES 
LESLIE MILLER IS IN PARENTHOOD 
SHE WANTS THE MINI VAN FOR A LITTLE MORE ROOM BUT THE MINI VAN SHE SETTLES ON WILL HAVE 
TWO AIR BAGS 
THIS ONE I LOOKED AT I ALMOST BOUGHT IT DOESN'T HAVE AIR BAGS 
SO I'M NOT EVEN GOING BACK 
SO THE CAR COMPANIES ARE MAKING AIR BAGS AND ANTI LOCK BRAKES STANDARD ON MANY MODELS 
WHEN YOU THINK OF PRICING FOR NINETY FOUR THINK OF THE WORD BUNDLE AS IN BUNDLE OF OPTIONS 
THAT'S HOW THE CAR COMPANIES ARE SELLING THEM AND YOU CAN FIND WHAT'S INCLUDED ON THE STICKER 
THE CAR COMPANIES SAY BUYING OPTIONS BY THE BUNDLE CAN SAVE YOU A BUNDLE 
IN THIS FORD EXPLORER A BUNDLE OF OPTIONS THAT INCLUDES AIR CONDITIONING AND AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION COST A ONE THOUSAND FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SAVINGS OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IF YOU BOUGHT THEM SEPARATELY 
CAR COMPANIES CALL THAT VALUE PRICING 
SO AS AUTO MAKERS BECOME MORE PRICE AND SAFETY SENSITIVE FOR NINETY FOUR THE NEW MODEL YEAR APPEARS TO BE ON A LEVEL HEADED COURSE 
DOMESTICALLY AND WORLDWIDE IT'S THE YEAR OF SANITY
