THANK YOU FOR JOINING US 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS ARE HOLDING A PRIVATE SERVICE THIS EVENING AT HER NEW YORK APARTMENT 
MRS. ONASSIS WILL BE BURIED TOMORROW BESIDE HER FIRST HUSBAND PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY 
THE CASKET WILL BE FLOWN TO WASHINGTON AFTER A PRIVATE FUNERAL IN NEW YORK 
C. N. N.'S GARY TUCHMAN HAS MORE ON THE FAREWELL TO THE FORMER FIRST LADY 
THERE WAS A MOB SCENE OF MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHEN JACQUELINE KENNEDY SON JOHN AND DAUGHTER CAROLINE SHOWED UP AT THEIR MOTHER'S APARTMENT FOR HER WAKE 
THE ENTRANCE WAS QUITE A BIT EASIER FOR MRS. SISTER LEE 
AT THE SMALL CHURCH WHERE JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS PRAYED HER DEATH WAS ANNOUNCED ON SUNDAY WITH THE TRADITIONAL PRAYER 
FOR THE SOULS OF THE DEPARTED THAT THEY MAY BE MADE CURRENT IN THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT 
ESPECIALLY FATHER R. BRUCE JACKSON SISTER BERNARD QUINN AND JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS 
LET US PRAY TO THE LORD 
THE SAINT THOMAS MORE CHURCH WHERE THE FORMER FIRST LADY OFTEN WORSHIPPED IS TOO SMALL FOR HER FUNERAL SERVICE SO THE MUCH LARGER SAINT LOYOLA CHURCH ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM HER HOME WAS DECIDED AS THE SITE FOR THE FUNERAL SERVICE 
FATHER WALTER WILL BE THE PRINCIPAL AT THE MASS 
THE PROCESSION TAKES PLACE DOWN THE CENTER AISLE OF THE CHURCH THE PRIESTS LEAD IT WITH THE CANDLE AND THEN THE FAMILY FOLLOWS THE COFFIN AND MAKES THEIR WAY TO THE FRONT 
ALL DAY SUNDAY PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME TO MRS. NEW YORK HOME LEAVING FLOWERS AT THE DOORSTEP AS A SIGN OF RESPECT 
PEOPLE WERE ALSO HONORING THE FORMER FIRST LADY AT JOHN F. KENNEDY'S GRAVE SITE THE PLACE THAT WILL ALSO BE HIS GRAVE SITE 
JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO JACQUELINE KENNEDY LIGHTED THE ETERNAL FLAME ON THE SITE THAT HASN'T BEEN EXTINGUISHED SINCE 
THE MONSIGNOR WHO PERFORMED THE CATHOLIC SACRAMENT OF THE SICK ON MRS. DEATH BED SAID HE WENT TO HER HOME WITH SOME FEAR AND TREPIDATION BECAUSE OF THE STATURE AND DIGNITY OF JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS 
SHE GAVE A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE TO HER RELIGIOUS DUTIES AND UNDER THE STRESS OF THE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER LIFE WHICH WERE MONUMENTAL YOU MIGHT SAY COMPARED WITH MOST OF US SHE CERTAINLY MUST HAVE DRAWN ON THOSE RELIGIOUS RESOURCES THAT SHE HAD DEEP WITHIN HER HEART 
THE MONSIGNOR SAYS HIS PARISH CHURCH WILL MISS HER TERRIBLY 
THE FUNERAL SERVICE WILL BE PRIVATE ONLY FAMILY CLOSE FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES WILL BE ALLOWED INSIDE 
BUT THE HEARTS OF COUNTLESS OTHERS WILL SURELY ALSO BE INSIDE
