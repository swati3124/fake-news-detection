ONE OF O. J. SIMPSON'S ATTORNEYS SAYS HE WILL TRY TO DIFFUSE THE WAR OF WORDS OVER THE CASE AND AN EXPERT FOR THE DEFENSE IS TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY PONDERING THE THREAT OF A JAIL SENTENCE 
JIM HILL HAS THE LATEST ON THE FAMOUS DOUBLE MURDER CASE 
WHAT SOME HAVE CALLED MEDIA MADNESS SURROUNDING THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE MAY BECOME A LITTLE MORE SANE 
THE DAILY TALK FROM DEFENSE LAWYERS IS APPARENTLY OVER 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD 
WE NO LONGER WILL BE TALKING TO THE PRESS ON A DAILY BASIS 
ALL THIS WEEK THE FAMILIES OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD GOLDMAN HAVE COMPLAINED THE DEFENSE HAS TAKEN THE LOW ROAD PUBLICLY PAINTING O. J. SIMPSON AS THE VICTIM INSTEAD OF THE TWO STABBING VICTIMS 
THE FATHER OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TOLD C. N. N. DEFENSE CONDUCT HAS BEEN PREPOSTEROUS AND INSULTING 
IT HAS BEEN THE DEFENSE TEAM LOUIS BROWN SAID THAT HAS CREATED A CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE OF UNPARALLELED MAGNITUDE WITH DAILY COURT HOUSE SPIN BRIEFINGS AUTOGRAPHS CONDESCENDING REMARKS AND COURTROOM ANTICS 
DEFENSE LAWYERS SAY THEIR NEW STANCE TOWARD THE MEDIA IS NOT THE RESULT OF THE FAMILY'S PUBLIC COMPLAINTS BUT AT LEAST ONE LEGAL EXPERT SAYS IT PROBABLY IS 
WELL I THINK MR. SHAPIRO'S BEING BEATEN AT HIS OWN GAME 
THAT'S A PROBLEM AND HE'S GOT TO QUICKLY RETREAT AND TAKE SOME ACTION 
ANOTHER ISSUE REMAINS UNRESOLVED 
SIMPSON D. N. A. EXPERT PETER NEUFELD IS STILL TORN BETWEEN TWO TRIALS ON TWO COASTS 
NEW YORK JUDGE HAROLD DOESN'T WANT NEUFELD TO LEAVE AN ESTIMATED TWO WEEK LONG CASE THAT BEGAN THURSDAY 
SIMPSON TRIAL JUDGE LANCE ITO HAS ORDERED NEUFELD TO HONOR A COMMITMENT TO BE AT THE SIMPSON D. N. A. HEARING ON DECEMBER TWELFTH 
I'M NOT CAPABLE OF DOING IT PHYSICALLY INTELLECTUALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND I DOUBT ANYONE ELSE IS WHO PRACTICES LAW 
JUDGE IS NOT CONVINCED 
THE JUDGE SAID I'M OUT OF SYMPATHY FOR MR. SIMPSON AND HIS ATTORNEYS 
NEUFELD COULD BE JAILED FOR CONTEMPT IF HE EITHER JUDGE 
HIS ATTORNEY IN NEW YORK IS ASKING AN APPEALS COURT TO FREE NEUFELD FROM THE EAST COAST CASE 
MEANWHILE THE PROCESS OF QUESTIONING POTENTIAL JURY ALTERNATES CONTINUES 
JUDGE ITO GAVE PROSPECTS A STRICT WARNING TO AVOID PUBLICITY ABOUT THE CASE 
HE SAID UNFORTUNATELY THE VELOCITY QUANTITY AND TONE OF NEWS MEDIA COVERAGE IS INCREASING BECAUSE OF FACTORS BEYOND THE COURT'S CONTROL 
A BRIEF HEARING WAS ALSO CONVENED TO DEAL WITH TWO JAIL ISSUES 
ONE OF THEM AN UNSPECIFIED MATTER WITH SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES WAS PUT OFF UNTIL A HEARING DECEMBER EIGHTH 
IT'S A GAG ORDER JUST ON THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF IT YES 
HE'S ASKED US NOT TO DISCUSS IT 
THE OTHER ISSUE DEALT WITH JAIL VISITS BY SIMPSON'S LAWYERS 
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAID THEY RESOLVED THAT ISSUE WITH JAIL OFFICIALS OUTSIDE COURT
