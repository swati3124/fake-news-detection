THE GUYS AND GALS WALKING INTO HOLLYWOOD COMEDY CLUBS WEARING FANCY SUITS ARE A DEAD GIVEAWAY THEY'RE NETWORK EXECUTIVES ON A CONTINUING MISSION TO FIND A STAND UP COMIC THAT COULD BE TURNED INTO A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR SIT COM FRANCHISE 
THERE'S A STAND UP INVASION ON NETWORK TELEVISION FOLLOWING THE PHENOMENAL RATINGS SUCCESSES OF ROSEANNE HOME IMPROVEMENT AND SEINFELD NINE NEW SHOWS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE FALL SCHEDULE BRINGING THE CURRENT TOTAL TO NEAR TWENTY 
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT MY WAY 
I DO IT THE SOUL WAY 
IT'S CALLED CHEAP LABOR 
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN TESTED YOU SEE A COMICS ALREADY BEEN TESTED 
SEE AN ACTOR IT'S OH MAN I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAN DO THIS 
A COMIC YOU GO SEE IN A CLUB PEOPLE ARE DYING HE BEEN DOING IT FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS HE'S TESTED 
WHAT BETTER PEOPLE THAN STAND UP COMICS TO KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY 
THAT'S WHAT WE DO 
WE ARE FUNNY FOR A LIVING SO WHY NOT IT'S LIKE A NATURAL PROGRESSION TO GO TO HAVE A SITCOM 
THEA YOU'RE YOURSELF TOO THIN 
OOH I LOVE THEA AND THIN IN THE SAME SENTENCE 
A. B. C. IS BANKING HEAVILY ON THE CONCEPT 
IT CURRENTLY FEATURES TEN PRIME TIME SHOWS STARRING COMICS INCLUDING THE BRAND NEW THEA THE PAULA POUNDSTONE SHOW AND GRACE UNDER FIRE WITH BRETT BUTLER 
WHEN THEY GET US WE'RE LIKE A COMBINATION OF A DREAM AND A NIGHTMARE 
LIKE OH MY GOSH IT THINKS 
IT HAS IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THIS SHOW SHOULD GO 
THAT POINT OF VIEW IS JUST WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE CREATION OF A NEW SITUATION COMEDY 
WHERE TIM ALLEN OR ROSEANNE OR A BRETT BUTLER OR A THEA CAN BRING SOME OF WHAT THEY BECAME POPULAR WITH AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE COMEDY CLUBS AND PUT SOME OF THAT INTO THE CREATION OF A SITUATION COMEDY 
FOX HAS FIVE SERIES STARING STAND UPS INCLUDING THE NEWLY ADDED AND DADDY DEAREST 
I DON'T MIND READING WORDS I NEVER WOULD HAVE COME UP WITH 
IF IT WORKS IT WORKS 
I JUST HAVE THE I'VE PAID MY DUES ENOUGH TO SAY THIS DOESN'T WORK 
C. B. S. WHICH HAS NO STAND UPS IN ITS LINE UP IS APPARENTLY NOT SOLD ON THE IDEA STICKING WITH THE TRIED AND TRUE SITCOM FORMULAS 
BUT NOT SO N. B. C.
