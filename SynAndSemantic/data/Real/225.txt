DEVELOPMENTS CONTINUE TO UNFOLD ON THIS IMPORTANT DAY IN MOSCOW 
C. N. N. CORRESPONDENT CLAIRE SHIPMAN IS THERE 
HELLO CLAIRE 
BOB WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW ARE CROWDS OUTSIDE OF THE FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND WHAT WE SAW JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO WAS A LARGE CROWD PEOPLE EMERGING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
WE SAW A FEW WHITE FLAGS FLYING 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS A SURRENDER IN FACT WE HAVE HEARD RUMORS THAT THEY MAY BE BRINGING OUT WOUNDED 
BUT WE DID SEE TWO WHITE FLAGS FLYING AND A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE EMERGING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND SOME AMBULANCES IN THE AREA AND THERE HAS BEEN NO GUNFIRE TO SPEAK OF FOR THE LAST WELL THERE IT IS AGAIN 
BUT IT HAD BEEN QUIET FOR THE LAST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
SO THEY MAY BE THE WOUNDED RIGHT NOW 
CLAIRE WHEN YOU SAY LARGE CROWD I REALIZE THIS IS AWFULLY IMPRECISE 
CAN YOU TAKE A GUESS AT THE SIZE OF THAT CROWD THAT CAME OUT 
WELL THE CROWD AS MASSED AS YOU SEE IT NOW SEEMS TO BE A LEAST ONE THOUSAND MAYBE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE 
THE CROWD THAT EMERGED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PROBABLY SOMEWHAT SMALLER 
THERE WAS A CROWD OUTSIDE THAT SEEMED TO GO UP THE STEPS TO MEET THEM AND THEY'VE MERGED TOGETHER 
WE COULDN'T REALLY GIVE YOU AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THE CROWD THAT CAME OUT 
ALL RIGHT 
DEVELOPMENTS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE IN MOSCOW 
THERE ARE NOW THEN AT LEAST CLEARLY SOMEWHAT FEWER PEOPLE INSIDE THE RUSSIAN WHITE HOUSE NOW THAN THERE WERE HALF AN HOUR AGO AND HAVE BEEN ALL NIGHT 
APPARENTLY SOME OF THE WOUNDED BEING BROUGHT OUT PERHAPS SOME OTHERS
