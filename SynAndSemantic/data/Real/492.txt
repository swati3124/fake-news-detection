GOOD EVENING 
FROM NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO IN WASHINGTON I'M JACKI LYDEN WITH ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
NORTH KOREA THAT ONE OF THE DOWNED U. S. ARMY SERVICEMEN IS DEAD 
PRESIDENT CARTER ARRIVES ON A PEACE MISSION IN SARAJEVO 
AND ONE WITNESS TO HISTORY HISTORIAN ARTHUR WHETHER THE NEW DEAL CREATED BY F. D. R. IS DEAD IN AN ERA OF LESS GOVERNMENT 
ALSO THE VERBAL OF DUTCH SOUND POET 
SOUND POETRY IS POETRY NOT MADE OF WORDS IN ANY EXISTING LANGUAGE BUT IN WORDS OR SOUNDS OR VOICE SOUNDS THAT THE POET MAKES UP 
HE'LL PERFORM SOME OF IT TONIGHT FOR US 
FIRST WE HAVE THIS ROUNDUP OF THE DAY'S NEWS 
IT'S ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
DANIEL AWAY 
I'M JACKI LYDEN 
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY SAYS THAT ONE OF THE U. S. PILOTS ABOARD THE DOWNED ARMY HELICOPTER IN NORTH KOREA IS DEAD 
THE SECOND PILOT IS SAID TO BE ALIVE 
THE INCIDENT COMES AT A SENSITIVE TIME IN U. S. NORTH KOREA RELATIONS 
NPR'S MELINDA HAS MORE 
THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A STATEMENT EARLY THIS AFTERNOON SAYING NORTH KOREA'S GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER DAVID HILEMON OF TENNESSEE HAD DIED 
THERE WAS NO INFORMATION OFFERED ON HOW THE U. S. ARMY HELICOPTER PILOT HAD BEEN KILLED OR WHEN 
FELLOW PILOT AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER BOBBY HALL OF BROOKSVILLE FLORIDA IS DESCRIBED AS ALIVE AND REPORTEDLY UNINJURED 
THE WHITE HOUSE STATEMENTS SPOKE OF THE DOWNING OF THE HELICOPTER BUT DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS ON WHETHER IT HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN 
THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THE LOSS OF LIFE TRAGIC AND UNNECESSARY AND SAID WORKING TO BRING HOME THE SURVIVOR AND REMAINS WAS NOW THE PRIMARY CONCERN 
HISTORY PROFESSOR JAMES AT NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT THINK THIS INCIDENT WILL GREATLY AFFECT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U. S. AND NORTH KOREA 
IF THIS INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED A YEAR AGO I THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IT 
A YEAR AGO OF COURSE THE PROSPECTS OF SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WERE SEEMED MUCH MORE DISTANT 
WITH THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG THIS SUMMER HOWEVER MY READING OF THE NORTH KOREAN CURRENT POLICY TOWARDS ITS RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES IS THAT THEY SEE DIPLOMATIC POLITICAL AND PERHAPS LONG TERM ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE IN CONTINUING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND I CAN'T SEE THAT THEY CAN SEE ANY BENEFIT IN USING THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT TO DELAY THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS 
INDEED THE INFORMATION THE WHITE HOUSE RECEIVED TODAY ON THE FATE OF THE TWO PILOTS CAME FROM CONGRESSMAN BILL RICHARDSON 
THE NEW MEXICO DEMOCRAT HAPPENED TO BE IN PYONGYANG TO DISCUSS THE TREATY SIGNED IN OCTOBER BETWEEN THE U. S. AND NORTH KOREA WHICH CALLS FOR NORTH KOREA TO TAKE APART ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
THAT ARRANGEMENT WOULD HAVE THE U. S. HELP THE NORTH KOREANS BUILD REACTORS THAT DON'T MAKE THE INGREDIENTS NECESSARY FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
ON N. B. C.'S MEET THE PRESS EARLIER TODAY NEW MEXICO REPUBLICAN SENATOR PETE DOMENICI SUGGESTED RAISING THAT ISSUE IN A BID TO GET BACK THE CREW OF THE CHOPPER 
I BELIEVE THE NORTH KOREANS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER HAVE TO JOIN THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO PUSH THEM VERY HARD 
IF IT IS AS WE SAY THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE NO REAL EXCUSE FOR HOLDING THEM AND WE OUGHT TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT INCLUDING SOME SERIOUS SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LOT OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FOR NUCLEAR REACTOR SAFETY 
NEW MEXICO STATE PROFESSOR JAMES DISAGREES WITH USING THAT AS A BARGAINING CHIP ON WHAT HE CALLS THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS HOT SPOT 
WELL I THINK THAT THOSE TWO ISSUES SHOULD BE MAINTAINED ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER 
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE OF ONGOING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA TO TRY AND OPEN UP NORTH KOREA TO INSPECTIONS REGARDING NUCLEAR FACILITIES IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PARTICULAR INCIDENT THAT RECENTLY TOOK PLACE AND THAT OF COURSE ISN'T TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LIVES OF THOSE TWO AMERICAN CITIZENS BUT CERTAINLY THOSE TWO ISSUES SHOULDN'T BE CONFUSED WITH ONE ANOTHER 
I THINK IT WOULD BE A BAD DIPLOMATIC MANEUVER ON THE UNITED STATES' PART 
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE U. S. MILITARY IN SEOUL SAYS U. S. HELICOPTERS DO FLY NEAR THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA 
IT IS POSSIBLE HE SAYS THAT A NAVIGATIONAL ERROR LED THE CHOPPER TO ENTER THE NORTH KOREAN AIR SPACE 
A HEAVY SNOW MAY HAVE MADE LANDMARKS DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
