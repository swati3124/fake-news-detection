DE HELPED CHANGE THE LOOK OF DANCE ON BROADWAY 
SHE DIED TODAY IN NEW YORK 
WITH A LOOK AT SOME OF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS C. N. N.'S CYNTHIA TORNQUIST 
WITH THE CREATION OF HER TRAIL BLAZING DANCES FOR THE NINETEEN FORTY THREE RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN MUSICAL OKLAHOMA AND THE MOVIE VERSION THAT FOLLOWED DE REVOLUTIONIZED THE LOOK OF THE AMERICAN MUSICAL 
SHE ALSO THE DANCES TO SUCH MUSICALS AS AND PAINT YOUR WAGON BUT IT WAS OKLAHOMA FOR WHICH SHE WILL BE BEST REMEMBERED 
OKLAHOMA WAS MY FIRST SHOW 
IT WASN'T THE FIRST SHOW I'D DONE BUT IT WAS THE FIRST SHOW I WASN'T FIRED FROM AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL 
AND WAS HARDER TO DO MUCH HARDER FOR ME BUT IT WAS IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL SHOW 
PAINT YOUR WAGON I THINK WAS BETTER DANCES THAN EVEN OKLAHOMA OR BUT IT WASN'T AS GOOD A SHOW 
DE USED DANCES LIKE OKLAHOMA S WRITERS OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN AND RICHARD RODGERS USED WORDS AND MUSIC TO EXPLORE CHARACTER 
SHE ELEVATED THE STATUS OF DANCE IN THE MUSICAL BY MAKING IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ACTION 
I THINK SHE BROUGHT BALLET INTO THE MUSICAL THEATER MORE THAN WHO ONLY HAD ONE OR TWO BUT I THINK HIS WAS DANCES THAT THE PLAY 
FURTHERED IT AND TOLD A STORY AND GAVE YOU INSIGHTS INTO CHARACTERS 
THE FIRST TIME SAID PLEASE WILL THE WHOLE CAST PLEASE SIT IN THE THEATER AND WATCH THIS I SAID TO ALFRED IF WE CAN GET HALF AS MUCH REALITY INTO THE BOOK AS SHE HAS GOTTEN IN THIS BALLET IT WILL BE A HELL OF A HIT
