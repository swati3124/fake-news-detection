THIS IS JOHN COCHRAN ON CAPITOL HILL WHERE OVERNIGHT OPINIONS HAD HARDENED AND BOB DOLE WHO ONLY YESTERDAY SPOKE OF A LITTLE STRAIN IN RELATIONS WITH RUSSIAN TODAY CALLED FOR A SUSPENSION OF AID UNLESS RUSSIA AND STOPS SPYING 
THIS AFFAIR THREATENS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC OF RUSSIA 
THE DEMOCRAT WHO HEADS THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ALSO CALLED FOR A FREEZE WHICH WILL PLEASE SOME FOLKS BACK HOME 
IN MY STATE ALREADY I'M ASKED YOU KNOW WHY DID YOU SUPPORT FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR RUSSIA 
WE SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN FOR FOOLS 
THERE'S NO SENSE IN GIVING AID TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO SPY ON US 
THE FACT THAT IT'S AN AMERICAN ACCUSED OF SPYING SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE 
THE CASE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON WHO BEFORE LAST MONTH'S TRIP TO MOSCOW URGED CONGRESS TO CONTINUE A FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR AID PACKAGE EVEN THOUGH CLINTON HAD BEEN BRIEFED ON RUSSIAN SPYING 
SO FAR CLINTON IS RESISTING PRESSURE TO SUSPEND AID 
MOST OF OUR GOVERNMENT AID IS IN THE FORM OF AID TO TAKE DOWN THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS WE SHOULD SLOW THAT UP 
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS TALK SHOWS HAD SOMETHING BESIDES TONYA AND NANCY TO DISCUSS 
I THINK THAT AS FAR AS RUSSIA'S CONCERNED THE NEXT TIME THEY WANT A FEW TONS OF WHEAT WE SHOULD TELL THEM TO GROW IT THEMSELVES 
IN RUSSIA AN INTELLIGENCE SPOKESMAN SAID AMERICANS ARE TYPICALLY OVERREACTING 
WE DON'T MAKE A BIG FUSS OUT OF IT 
WHY SHOULD AMERICANS USE THE OCCASION JUST TO PROVOKE TENSION BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES 
EVEN CONGRESS ADMITS THE RUSSIANS ARE ONLY DOING WHAT AMERICANS SPIES DO 
AS SENATOR EXON FROM NEBRASKA SAID IF WE DON'T HAVE SPIES OVER THERE THEN WE SHOULD HAVE
