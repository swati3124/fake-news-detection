FEDERAL MARSHALS ARE STATIONED AT A NUMBER OF ABORTION CLINICS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING DEATHS OF A DOCTOR AND HIS ESCORT IN PENSACOLA FLORIDA LAST WEEK 
GROUPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE HAVE DENOUNCED THE MURDERS 
BUT THE SHOOTINGS HAVE INCREASED TENSIONS IN AN ALREADY INTENSE DEBATE 
A MOVEMENT KNOWN AS COMMON GROUND HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO GET BOTH SIDES OF THE ABORTION DEBATE TO SIT DOWN AND FIND ISSUES THEY CAN AGREE ON 
THEY SAY TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE 
BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS WITHIN THE GROUP ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THE MURDERS WILL HAVE ON THEIR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE A PEACEFUL DIALOGUE 
FROM SAINT LOUIS NPR'S KATHY LOHR HAS THIS REPORT 
PEOPLE IN COMMON GROUND AGREE TO DISAGREE OVER THE ISSUE OF ABORTION 
THEN THEY SEARCH FOR COMMON GOALS THAT THEY CAN WORK ON TOGETHER LIKE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNWANTED PREGNANCIES 
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS COMMON GROUND GROUPS HAVE SPRUNG UP IN HALF A DOZEN CITIES INCLUDING BUFFALO CLEVELAND CINCINNATI AND DENVER 
A NATIONAL OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED IN WASHINGTON D. C. LAST JANUARY A KIND OF CLEARING HOUSE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY THIS APPROACH 
BUT EFFORTS TO BRING TOGETHER THOSE WHO'VE BECOME BITTER ENEMIES ARE STILL FRAGILE 
AND SOME ARE WONDERING WHETHER THE VIOLENCE WILL SET THE MOVEMENT BACK 
THE FIRST COMMON GROUND GROUP BEGAN IN SAINT LOUIS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO 
LORETTA WAGNER IS A LONG TIME ANTI ABORTION ACTIVIST WHO HELPED GET THE EFFORT GOING 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CYNICISM AND SUSPICION ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE REGARDING COMMON GROUND 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME 
AND I'M AFRAID THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY CAN GIVEN AMMUNITION TO PEOPLE TO SAY WELL LOOK WE'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU IT WAS THIS WAY 
WHY DO YOU TRUST THOSE PEOPLE OR IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK 
LORETTA WAGNER HOPES PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE BEYOND THEIR ANGER OVER LAST WEEK'S MURDER OF A DOCTOR AND HIS VOLUNTEER ESCORT AND REALIZE THAT THE COMMON GROUND MOVEMENT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO REVERSE THE HOSTILITY AND THE VIOLENT ATMOSPHERE THAT NOW EXISTS 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMMON GROUND SERVES TO DO I THINK IS TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC NOT CHANGING ANYBODY'S OPINION ON THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF ABORTION BUT JUST BEING ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THOSE AREAS WHERE IT COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
ANTI ABORTION AND ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN MISSOURI AGREE ON REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ABORTIONS 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE GROUP HELPED PASS LEGISLATION CREATING A TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR WOMEN ADDICTED TO CRACK COCAINE AND ANOTHER MEASURE EXPANDING A SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM FOR POOR CHILDREN 
NOW THEY'RE WORKING TO DEVELOP A STATE WELFARE REFORM MEASURE 
PEOPLE WHO'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED COMMON GROUND GROUPS ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER 
BUT THERE IS CONCERN THAT AFTER THE VIOLENCE MANY WHO NEVER ACCEPTED THE IDEA OR OTHERS JUST GETTING INVOLVED MAY BE PUT OFF 
THE RECENT INCIDENT IN PENSACOLA IS VERY SERIOUS AND POSES A CHALLENGE TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE 
B. J. JONES RUNS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES A SAINT LOUIS CLINIC WHERE ABORTIONS ARE PERFORMED 
SHE'S ALSO ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN THE COMMON GROUND MOVEMENT 
WE'RE JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE PENSACOLA EVENT 
WE'RE GRIEVING 
THOSE OF US PROVIDERS ARE FRIGHTENED 
WE NEED SOME TIME TO DO SOME HEALING BEFORE I NEED SOME TIME TO DO SOME HEALING BEFORE I CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT MUCH OF ANYTHING RIGHT NOW 
THIS WEEK JONES' PRIORITY IS THE SAFETY OF HER OWN STAFF 
BUT THERE WILL BE NO IN HER EFFORTS TO FURTHER COMMON GROUND AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO JOIN 
IN FACT THREE NEW GROUPS ARE FORMING 
THE MURDERS IN PENSACOLA CAUSED PEOPLE IN DALLAS TEXAS TO TAKE SOME QUICK ACTION 
UP UNTIL NOW THE DALLAS GROUP HAD ONLY HELD A COUPLE OF MEETINGS TO GET ACQUAINTED 
SINCE THE MURDERS ANTI ABORTION ACTIVIST JOHN SAYS THE PEOPLE DECIDED TO MOVE UP THEIR TIME TABLE AND MEET LATER THIS WEEK 
AT THAT TIME WE ARE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A MISSION STATEMENT WHERE WE CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW WE WANT TO GROW AND IN WHICH DIRECTION INITIALLY 
AND THE SHOOTING DID HAVE A LOT TO GALVANIZE US TO GO FORWARD AND MOVE FORWARD VERY QUICKLY 
THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMON GROUND MOVEMENT SAY TWO DECADES OF PROTESTS HAVE DONE LITTLE TO FURTHER THE OBJECTIVES OF EITHER SIDE OF THE ABORTION ISSUE 
THEY'RE TIRED OF THE CONTROVERSY THE BITTERNESS AND THE VIOLENCE 
THEY HOPE THE LATEST MURDERS WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO SEARCH FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS AND PERHAPS THEIR OWN COMMON GROUP
