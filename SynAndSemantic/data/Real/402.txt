I'M JUDY WOODRUFF WITH MY COLLEAGUE BERNARD SHAW 
ONCE AGAIN BACK TO OUR COVERAGE OF THE WHITEWATER HEARINGS TODAY BEFORE THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE 
AND BERNIE WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE WE SHOULD SAY JOINING US NOW 
WE WANT TO SAY THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FOR A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR IS THE WOMEN WHO'S THE GENERAL COUNSEL AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT WHOSE TESTIMONY TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN PRIVATE UP UNTIL NOW HAVE CONTRADICTED THE TESTIMONY OF BOTH THE TREASURY SECRETARY AND THE TREASURY DEPUTY SECRETARY 
SO HER WORDS HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH AWAITED 
SHE'S BEING QUESTIONED NOW BY SENATOR RICHARD SHELBY DEMOCRAT OF ALABAMA 
THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH MR. NUSSBAUM RELATED TO PRESS INQUIRIES THAT HE WAS LIKELY TO RECEIVE 
HE WAS BOUND BY THE ETHICS REGULATIONS 
O. K. 
AND IN FACT WAS THE CHIEF ETHICS OFFICER FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
AND I WAS BOUND BY THE ETHICS RULES AS WELL AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE WOULD USE THAT INFORMATION FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE THAT I INTENDED IT TO BE USED 
AS GENERAL COUNSEL THERE AT THE TREASURY AND ALSO WORKING WITH R. O. T. C. IN THAT ROLE DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT INFORMATION ONCE IT LEFT R. T. C. COULD BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES 
COULD BE LEAKED PAST THE WHITE HOUSE 
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION AND IN FACT I TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT THAT THE INFORMATION WAS GOING TO BE LEAKED AND IT WAS LEAKED OUT OF THE R. T. C. TO A NUMBER OF NEWS REPORTERS 
MS. HANSON DID YOU EVER EVER CHECK WITH TREASURY OR R. T. C. ETHICS OFFICERS BEFORE MEETING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT 
I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE ETHICS RULES 
I UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY OPERATED 
I UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS DOING THIS FOR A GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE A PROPER GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE 
HAVE YOU HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ON THAT 
EXCUSE ME 
HAVE YOU HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ON THAT 
NO AND THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS HAS SAID THE SAME THING 
O. K. 
IN YOUR MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON IN YOUR DEPOSITION AND HERE TOO I SUPPOSE BUT COULD YOU TELL US FOR THE RECORD AGAIN WHAT YOU BASICALLY TOLD MR. NUSSBAUM AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN 
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE THERE TOO 
MR. SLOAN 
MR. SLOAN 
AS I STATED I DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFICS OF THE CONVERSATION 
I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHAT I SAID 
I COULDN'T HAVE 
DID YOU TAKE NOTES WITH YOU WHEN YOU WENT DOWN THERE 
I DON'T RECALL THAT I DID 
YOU DON'T RECALL WHETHER YOU TOOK NOTES DOWN THERE AND YOU DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFIC CONVERSATION BUT YOU DO RECALL BRIEFING HIM REGARDING THE R. T. C. INFORMATION THAT WAS TO YOU 
THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT OF YOUR OWN RECOLLECTION YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF IT NOW 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO THE COMMITTEE 
I DON'T REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY WHAT I TOLD HIM 
O. K. 
WELL COULD YOU GENERALLY TELL US WHAT YOU TOLD HIM 
WELL GOING BACK TO MR. NOTES WHICH WAS A QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED ABOUT 
ARE YOU REFERRING TO MR. NOTES NOW 
I'M REFERRING TO MR. NOTES OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH 
O. K. 
AND LOOKING AT MR. NOTES THEY DO NOT REFRESH MY RECOLLECTION OF HAVING HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM ON THAT DATE 
AND THERE'S SOME INFORMATION IN HERE THAT I DON'T RECOGNIZE BUT THE BULK OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN MR. NOTES IS WHAT I RECALL HAVING BEEN TOLD BY MR. 
DO YOU DIFFER WITH HIS NOTES IN ANY WAY 
THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN HERE I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER 
WHAT DO YOU DIFFER WITH 
AS I SAY I DON'T REMEMBER 
SOME OF THE THINGS IN HERE I DON'T REMEMBER 
I DON'T REMEMBER FOR EXAMPLE THE WHITEWATER COMPANY 
I JUST DON'T REMEMBER THAT 
YES MA'AM 
BUT THE BULK OF WHAT IS HERE IS MY RECOLLECTION OF WHAT I WAS TOLD BY MR. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE MEETING DO YOU HAVE ANY REAL REASON TO DIFFER WITH HIS NOTES 
NUMBER 
NO SIR 
MS. HANSON DID YOU CHECK WITH THE TREASURY ETHICS OFFICER BEFORE THE FEBRUARY SECOND WHITE HOUSE MEETING 
I ASKED YOU AND YOU SAID NO 
IS THAT RIGHT 
I THOUGHT YOU ASKED ME ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 
THE FIRST WHITE HOUSE O. K. THE FIRST ONE 
DID YOU CHECK WITH THE WHITE HOUSE DID YOU CHECK WITH THE TREASURY ETHICS OFFICERS BEFORE THE FEBRUARY SECOND WHITE HOUSE MEETING 
YES I DID 
YOU DID 
AND WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU IF ANYTHING 
WE DISCUSSED GENERALLY THE TOPICS THAT MR. ALTMAN INTENDED TO DISCUSS 
DID THEY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF THE MEETING AND HOW IT WOULD THE PERCEPTION OF IT 
DID YOU GO INTO THAT 
I SPOKE WITH THE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL WHO IS THE TREASURY DESIGNATED AGENCY ETHICS OFFICER FOR HIS PEERS 
AND WHAT ADVICE DID YOU GET IF ANY 
HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE AN OBJECTION TO THE MEETING 
NO OBJECTION TO THE MEETING 
O. K. 
I BELIEVE YOU WERE ASKED EARLIER ABOUT YOUR ABOUT WHEN MR. ALTMAN TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS SAME BANKING COMMITTEE BACK IN FEBRUARY 
I FORGET THE EXACT DATE 
AND YOU WERE IN THE AUDIENCE 
YOU WERE COUNSEL SEATED RIGHT BEHIND HIM IF I RECALL 
IS THAT CORRECT 
THAT'S CORRECT 
WHAT AND YOU RECALL I RECALL YOU USING THE PHRASE THAT YOU SAID AND I QUOTE YOU THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE FURTHER ON SOME OF HIS ANSWERS 
IS THAT YOUR WORDS 
THOSE ARE MY WORDS 
O. K. 
BUT DID YOU EVER WHILE HE WAS TESTIFYING HAND HIM A NOTE OR SOMETHING TO REFRESH HIS RECOLLECTION ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING ASKED FOR HIM 
I RECALL HANDING HIM NOTES FROM TIME TO TIME 
BUT DO YOU RECALL IF THESE WERE TO CORRECT SOME OF THESE ANSWERS AND HE DIDN'T HE IGNORED THE NOTES OR WHAT 
I DON'T RECALL SIR 
I RECALL THAT MS. AND I DRAFTED A RESPONSE TO AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION WE ANTICIPATED DURING THE HEARING AND GAVE THAT TO HIM FOR HIM TO LOOK IT OVER BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHAT ELSE 
WHAT HE DID WITH IT IF ANYTHING DO YOU 
WELL HE KEPT THAT ONE TO USE FOR AN ANSWER 
IT WAS A QUESTION THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO AND DRAFTED IT DURING THE COURSE OF THE HEARING 
AND I PASSED HIM SOME OTHER NOTES AS WELL 
I DON'T RECALL WHAT THEY WERE 
WERE SOME OF THOSE NOTES AND THIS WILL BE MY MY TIME IS UP MY LAST PART OF THIS QUESTION 
WERE SOME OF THE NOTES THAT Y'ALL WOULD PASS TO HIM THEN WOULD THEY BE TO HELP HIM FURTHER ELABORATE ON HIS ANSWERS LIKE WE ALL DO 
I DON'T RECALL THAT ANY THAT THERE WERE ANY NOTES OF THAT TYPE 
O. K. 
MY TIME IS UP 
I WANT TO YIELD TO SENATOR MACK WHO IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON THEIR SIDE 
I'VE SPOKEN TO SENATOR D'AMATO 
I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MINUTE MYSELF 
I THINK IT'S I'LL ELABORATE ON THIS MORE AT A LATER POINT 
I THINK FOR YOUR REFERENCE AND THE REFERENCE OF ANY OTHER PERSON THAT COMES BEFORE A SENATE OR HOUSE COMMITTEE IN A SITUATION SUCH AS THE MEETING WE'RE REFERRING TO IF INFORMATION IS ASKED FOR BY A SENATOR LET'S KEEP IT ON THE SENATE SIDE AND AN INCOMPLETE ANSWER IS GIVEN AND TO GET THE INFORMATION LATER IS NOT THE SAME THING AS GIVING A FULL AND RESPONSIVE ANSWER AT THE TIME PARTICULARLY IF THERE ARE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS 
IF THERE'S A PATTERN OF QUESTIONS THAT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SENATORS ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IF THERE ARE INCOMPLETE ANSWERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND YOU'RE THERE IN THE ROOM AND YOU POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE AND YOU ALLOW THAT TO GO ON I THINK YOU HAVE SOME OBLIGATION YOU AND ANYBODY ELSE IN THAT SITUATION TO RESPOND IN REAL TIME 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE HEARINGS 
YES YOU PUT STUFF IN THE RECORD THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION ON AT THE TIME 
IF YOU'VE GOT TO GO FIND SOMETHING AND PUT IT IN THE RECORD THAT'S ONE THING 
IF YOU'RE SITTING THERE AND YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION AND IT'S WITHHELD THAT IS NOT PROPER IN MY VIEW WHETHER YOU'RE THE PERSON DOING THE TESTIFYING OR SOMEBODY YOU DIRECTLY REPORT TO IS SITTING THERE DOING THE TESTIFYING AND IS GIVING ANSWERS NOT ONCE BUT MORE THAN ONCE THAT ARE INCOMPLETE AND YOU RECOGNIZE TO BE INCOMPLETE I THINK THERE'S AN OBLIGATION TO RESPOND IN REAL TIME 
AND YOU CAN WRITE A NOTE AS YOU SAY JUST DID WITH MS. ON SOMETHING ELSE 
YOU CAN CERTAINLY WRITE A NOTE IN THAT AREA 
AND I SAY THAT TO YOU BUT TO EVERYBODY ELSE THAT MIGHT BE THERE IN AN EQUIVALENT SITUATION 
A LATER RESPONSE DOWN THE LINE FOR THE RECORD IS NOT THE SAME THING AS A TRUE AND ACCURATE RESPONSE IN REAL TIME 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING 
I DO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SIR 
IF I MIGHT AS I STATED MR. ALTMAN WAS TESTIFYING 
HE HAD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN FRONT OF HIM 
AND I HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS MAKING DECISIONS AS HE TESTIFIED 
THE ISSUES BEFORE US NOW HAVE ASSUMED MUCH MORE IMPORTANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE THAN THEY HAD AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME 
AS I STATED I FULLY EXPECTED THAT WE WOULD RESPOND IN AN ORDERLY WAY AND RESPOND FULLY AND COMPLETELY TO EVERY QUESTION 
AND THERE WAS NO INTENTION ON MY PART SIR NOT TO DO THAT 
MR. CHAIRMAN COULD I HAVE TEN SECONDS ON THIS FOLLOW UP 
YEAH SURE GO AHEAD 
OF COURSE 
MRS. HANSON YOU SAID THAT MR. ALTMAN HAD THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS BEFORE HIM 
WERE THESE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ANTICIPATED LIKE IN PREPARATION FOR THE OVERSIGHT HEARING AND SOME OF THE ANSWERS THAT YOU ALL HAD PREPARED OR HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF TO ANSWER ACCORDINGLY 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO 
YES 
BUT SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF A OVERSIGHT HEARING OR A COURTROOM OR SO FORTH YOU CAN'T ALWAYS ANTICIPATE THE QUESTION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THOSE QUESTIONS ARE SPONTANEOUS 
IS THAT CORRECT 
THAT'S CORRECT 
AND SO IF HE HAD A STOCK ANSWER IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE PROPER ANSWER TO A SPONTANEOUS QUESTION 
THAT'S CORRECT 
AND IN FACT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN 
COUNSEL JUST HANDED YOU THE PREPARATION SHEET THAT SHE'S MAKING REFERENCE TO IN THIS SITUATION AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT LAST POINT IS ONE OF THE CONTENTIOUS POINTS IN THE SENSE THAT THAT HAD BEEN REVIEWED AND WAS A PART OF THE FORMAL WRITTEN PREPARATION AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY SHE'S MAKING REFERENCE TO RIGHT NOW 
BUT I THOUGHT AS SHE SAID THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE DOCUMENT WITH YOU 
MR. CHAIRMAN I THINK WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO IS WHAT I ALLUDED TO AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ANSWER ACCORDINGLY AND IF THEY'VE GOT INFORMATION THEY BRING IT OUT THEN NOT LATER RIGHT 
SENATOR MACK 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN 
MS. HANSON I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT MEMO ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH FOR JUST A MOMENT THAT YOU HAD SENT TO MR. ALTMAN WHERE YOU HAVE ASKED BILL TO KEEP ME INFORMED 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING 
I GAVE MY COPY BACK I'M SORRY 
CAN SOMEONE PROVIDE HER WITH THAT MEMO AGAIN THEN 
NO NOT THAT NO DON THAT'S I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MEMO THAT SHE WROTE TO 
I BEG YOUR PARDON 
THERE WE GO 
THAT'S IT 
MS. HANSON 
THE QUESTION AND AGAIN THIS IS REALLY JUST IN PASSING 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING IS THAT IN THAT MEMORANDUM THAT YOU HAVE 
IS THAT IN THAT MEMORANDUM 
YES IT IS 
YES IT IS SIR 
O. K. 
AND ALL MY QUESTION IS IS THE WE YOU AND MR. ALTMAN 
AS I SAY I DON'T HAVE AN INDEPENDENT RECOLLECTION OF PREPARING THIS MEMORANDUM BUT I WOULD INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN YES 
I UNDERSTAND 
WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT WE MR. ALTMAN AND I SHOULD BE DOING 
O. K. 
FINE 
DID YOU ATTEND OR SET UP A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON OCTOBER FOURTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
I ATTENDED A MEETING I DIDN'T SET IT UP 
O. K. 
AND WHO ATTENDED 
FROM TREASURY JOSHUA STEINER AND JACK AND MYSELF AND FROM THE WHITE HOUSE MR. NUSSBAUM MR. SLOAN MR. LINDSEY MR. GEARAN 
I UNDERSTAND MR. WAS THERE AS WELL BUT I DON'T RECALL THAT 
YEAH O. K. 
I'M GOING TO READ YOU JUST PART OF A MEMORANDUM THAT BRUCE LINDSEY AND HE WAS THERE 
YES SIR 
A MEMORANDUM THAT BRUCE LINDSEY WROTE ON OCTOBER TWENTIETH WITH REFERENCE TO THE OCTOBER FOURTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE MEETING 
TWO PARAGRAPHS THAT I'M GOING TO READ 
ONE OF THE REFERRALS HOWEVER INVOLVED AND THIS IS HIS RECOLLECTION OF THE MEETING ONE OF THE REFERRALS HOWEVER INVOLVED FOUR CASHIER'S CHECKS EACH FOR THREE THOUSAND 
TWO WERE MADE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
TWO WERE MADE PAYABLE TO THE CLINTON FOR GOVERNOR CAMPAIGN AND TWO MADE PAYABLE TO BILL CLINTON 
THE CHECKS WERE DATED APRIL FOURTH AND FIFTH OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
ALL FOUR CHECKS WERE DEPOSITED INTO THE BANK OF CHERRY VALLEY 
WANTED TO FIND OUT WHO HAD ENDORSED THE CHECKS 
A CHECK OF OUR CAMPAIGN RECORDS TURNED UP THREE CASHIER'S CHECKS FOR THREE THOUSAND EACH FROM J. W. FULBRIGHT KEN PEACOCK AND AND A PERSONAL CHECK FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM JIM MCDOUGAL SIGNED BY SUSAN MCDOUGAL 
LATER ON IN THE MEMORANDUM THE R. T. C. BELIEVES THAT THE FUNDS FOR THE CASHIER'S CHECKS CAME FROM A LOAN FROM MADISON GUARANTY TO A REPUBLICAN BUT SUPPOSEDLY THE REPUBLICAN WAS UNAWARE THAT SOME OF THE LOAN FUNDS HAD BEEN DIVERTED 
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF THAT BEING DISCUSSED AT THAT 
I HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF CHECKS BEING DISCUSSED AND I'VE SEEN MR. MEMO 
IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME FROM THAT MEMO THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN WHETHER INFORMATION WAS DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING OR SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDED 
I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THAT LAST PARAGRAPH 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOURCE OF THAT INFORMATION IS AND I DON'T RECALL HAVING HEARD IT 
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING 
WERE YOU EVER GIVEN THAT INFORMATION 
I'M SORRY 
WERE YOU EVER GIVEN THAT INFORMATION 
SENATOR MACK HAS JUST RELAYED TO YOU A MEMO 
I WANT TO KNOW IN THE BRIEFING THAT YOU HAD DID YOU EVER GET THAT INFORMATION 
DID I EVER GET THE INFORMATION 
WHEN MR. CALLED YOU AND MADE REFERENCE TO THE NINE CRIMINAL REFERRALS DID HE GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION 
IS THAT THE INFORMATION HE GAVE YOU 
THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHECKS OR THE INFORMATION OR THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
ABOUT THE NINE REFERRALS AND DID HE GIVE YOU 
I DON'T RECALL HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT CHECKS FROM MR. AT ALL 
BUT YOU DO REMEMBER THE NINE CRIMINAL REFERRALS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND IF I CAN JUST JUST THE LAST POINT 
I THE IMPLICATION I THINK THAT'S HERE THOUGH FRANKLY IS THAT MR. LINDSEY HAS LEARNED ABOUT THESE CHECKS FROM YOU 
THAT'S THE IMPLICATION 
I DID NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION 
SIR I UNDERSTOOD ACTUALLY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHECKS CAME FROM MR. MR. THAT IT WAS THE 
I DON'T THINK HE HAD THAT INFORMATION 
YEAH THE R. T. C. BELIEVES THAT THE FUNDS FOR THE CASHIER'S CHECKS CAME FROM A YEAH I DON'T THINK MR. HAD THAT INFORMATION AT THAT TIME 
WELL CERTAINLY MR. ACCORDING TO THIS HAD THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHECKS BECAUSE MR. WANTED MR. TO FIND OUT WHO HAD ENDORSED THEM 
AS I SAY I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF EVER HAVING HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT CHECKS FROM MR. 
I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS 
SENATOR BENNETT 
THANK YOU 
I INTEND TO YIELD TO SENATOR ROTH
