IN THE END THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE COULD TURN ON A THE RESULTS OF COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC TESTING INVOLVING THE D. N. A. 
IN OUR FOCAL POINT C. N. N.'S ROBERT VITO TAKES A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW WHAT HAPPENS IN LABORATORY CAN IMPACT ON WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE COURTROOM 
A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD YIELD VOLUMES OF INFORMATION 
D. N. A. STRANDS PULLED OUT OF BLOOD CELLS CAN GIVE SCIENTISTS AN INDIVIDUAL'S D. N. A. CODE 
D. N. A. IT COULD BECOME A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE UPCOMING O. J. SIMPSON MURDER TRIAL 
IS THE TESTING PROPOSED BY THE PROSECUTION NECESSARY 
ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT WE BE ABLE TO REPLICATE THEIR P. C. R. TESTS BEFORE THEY DO THE RFLP TESTS 
POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION OR P. C. R. TESTING WHAT IT USUALLY DOES IS TELL WHETHER A PERSON IS EXCLUDED THAT THE PERSON COULD NOT BE THE SOURCE OF A BLOOD SAMPLE BEING EXAMINED FROM A CRIME SCENE 
BUT IT CANNOT TELL IF THE SAMPLE CAME FROM A PARTICULAR PERSON AND THAT'S WHY SOME LEGAL EXPERTS SAY 
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HERE ABOUT P. C. R. TESTIMONY IN THE COURTROOM IN CALIFORNIA 
P. C. R. THUS FAR IT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED TO BE ADMISSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA COURTS 
IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY FOR RESTRICTION FRAGMENT LINKS OR RFLP 
RFLP TESTING PROVIDES THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL THE MOST DISCRIMINATING TOOL TO DISCERN AN INDIVIDUAL THAT EXISTS IN EVIDENCE ANALYSIS TODAY 
STATISTICS CAN BE DEVELOPED FROM RFLP TESTING WHICH REALLY HELP THE PROSECUTOR SUSTAIN ITS BURDEN OF PROOF 
IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE STATISTICS THAT SHOW ONE IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR THAT ONE IN A MILLION HAVE THE SAME GENETIC BLOOD MATCH 
P. C. R. IS A PRELIMINARY TEST IT TAKES ABOUT ONE WEEK TO COMPLETE 
RFLP IS MORE PRECISE AND TAKES ABOUT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS FOR RESULTS 
LABORATORIES WHICH WILL DO THE TESTING IN THIS CASE HAILS D. N. A. FINGERPRINTING AS THE ULTIMATE IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY 
BY USING THE LATEST TOOLS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY SCIENTISTS CAN LOOK AT THE D. N. A. IN A FEW CELLS AND TELL BEYOND ANY DOUBT FROM WHOM THOSE CELLS CAME 
BUT NOT EVERYONE AGREES INCLUDING SOME 
ONE SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT A D. N. A. TEST IS 
WE KNOW THESE TESTS ALTHOUGH HELPFUL ARE NOT 
ERRORS CAN OCCUR CAN OCCUR 
THE TECHNOLOGY OF D. N. A. TESTING HAS GAINED GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OVER TIME 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE METHODOLOGY 
THE DEFENSE CAN RAISE ISSUES ABOUT ERRORS THAT TOOK PLACE IN ANALYSIS 
AS FOR THE CONTROVERSY OVER SPLITTING SAMPLES IN THE SIMPSON CASE IT'S EASY TO DO FOR P. C. R. TESTING BECAUSE ONLY A TINY AMOUNT OF BLOOD IS NEEDED 
BUT THE PROSECUTION IS CONCERNED THAT EVEN WITH ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE SET ASIDE FOR THE DEFENSE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR PROSECUTORS TO COMPLETE THE MORE COMPLICATED RFLP TEST
