IN THE MARKETS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA SHOPKEEPERS ARE SELLING MORE THAN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
IT TURNS OUT ENDANGERED SPECIES FROM THE ARE ALSO MAKING THEIR WAY THERE 
C. N. N.'S DAVID MATTINGLY REPORTS 
FROM THE SMOG LADEN SKYLINE OF BANGKOK TO THE VILLAGES OF VIETNAM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA GOVERNMENTS MAY MAKE THE LAWS BUT IN THE STREETS IT'S SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAT RULE THE DAY 
AT THIS MARKET IN HO CHI MINH CITY WE FOUND ENDANGERED ANIMALS FOR SALE AVAILABLE AT SURPRISINGLY AFFORDABLE PRICES 
HOW MUCH 
FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS 
WHAT IS SOUTHEAST ASIA LOSING 
THEY'RE LOSING THEIR HERITAGE BASICALLY 
IT'S THEIR NATURAL HERITAGE 
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IAN BAIRD OF THE EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE INVESTIGATED THE WILDLIFE TRADE THROUGHOUT THAILAND CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM 
HE CAPTURED PAINFUL SCENES LIKE THIS WITH HIS VIDEO CAMERA 
THIS ANIMAL IS OBVIOUSLY IN AGONY 
YEAH TELL ME ABOUT IT 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS BEAR 
PROBABLY IT WILL GET THE BILE SUCKED OUT OF IT IN A TUBE AND THE GALL BLADDER TAKEN OUT FOR SOMEBODY TO EAT AND IT WILL EVENTUALLY DIE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
IN THAILAND THERE ARE LAWS TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES BUT USING A HIDDEN CAMERA BAIRD WAS ABLE TO SHOW ME HOW OFTEN THE LAW IS IGNORED AND HOW EASY IT IS TO BREAK 
CAN YOU ASK HIM IF HE HAS ANY TIGER 
THAT'S A BEAR GALL BLADDER 
THIS GUY IS VERY SUSPICIOUS 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO US 
AREN'T THESE ILLEGAL 
THE POLICE DON'T COME AND CATCH YOU 
THIS WOMAN WAS SELLING TIGER TEETH SHE SAYS CAME ACROSS THE BORDER FROM BURMA 
THIS MAN WAS SELLING CHUNKS OF DRIED ELEPHANT SKIN 
ISN'T THIS ILLEGAL 
HE SAYS IT'S NOT ILLEGAL 
WHY IS THIS LEGAL 
I THOUGHT ALL ELEPHANT WAS ILLEGAL 
THEY'RE ASKING WHY YOU WANT TO KNOW 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW 
WE REPORTED OUR FINDINGS TO MR. LING THE HEAD OF THE ROYAL FORESTRY DEPARTMENT THE AGENCY CHARGED WITH PROTECTING WILDLIFE 
THIS GOVERNMENT TROPHY ROOM IS FILLED WITH CONFISCATED ITEMS LIKE AFRICAN IVORY AND TIGER SKINS BUT NEITHER MR. NOR HIS STAFF COULD TELL ME THE LAST TIME ANY SEIZURES OR ARRESTS WERE MADE 
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT WE WENT THROUGH THE STREETS OF BANGKOK WE FOUND GALL BLADDERS FROM BEARS WE FOUND TIGER TEETH WE FOUND TIGER CLAWS ALL OPEN FOR SALE 
THESE PEOPLE I MEAN OUR OFFICERS WILL GO AND ARREST THEM RIGHT AWAY 
WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE THAI LAW 
IT SAYS THAT IT'S THERE ON PAPER BUT IT'S NOT BEING ENFORCED AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ENFORCED MORE 
WELL PEOPLE LIKE IN THIS SHOP WHERE WE JUST WALKED IN OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT TAKING THE LAW SERIOUSLY IF HE'S SELLING ELEPHANT SKIN 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT AND NOW ALTHOUGH HE'S A LITTLE WORRIED 
HE'S NOW JUST TAKING IT OUT OF HIS WINDOW 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SKIN 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SKIN 
HE'S PUT IT AWAY 
WHY DID HE PUT IT AWAY 
DID WE SAY SOMETHING WRONG 
HE'S AFRAID THE POLICE WILL COME AND GET HIM 
I THOUGHT HE SAID HE'S NOT BREAKING THE LAW 
WELL OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T THINK THAT NOW
