SOME COMPELLING PHOTOGRAPHS OF SYMBOLS IN A LAOTIAN RICE PADDY HAVE RAISED NEW QUESTIONS OF WHETHER AMERICAN P. O. W.'S WERE LEFT BEHIND IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
C. N. N.'S CARL ROCHELLE REPORTS THE PHOTOS WERE THE FOCUS OF A HEARING TODAY BEFORE A SENATE COMMITTEE LOOKING INTO THE P. O. W. ISSUE 
THE LETTERS U. S. A. ARE CLEARLY VISIBLE IN PICTURES RELEASED BY THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON P. O. W. SLASH M. I. A. AFFAIRS 
NEAR U. S. A. IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE LETTER K. RECOGNIZED BY SOME AS A DISTRESS SIGNAL 
THE PICTURES WERE MADE FROM CLASSIFIED SATELLITE PHOTOS TAKEN JANUARY TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AT SAM LAOS AN AREA WHERE U. S. PRISONERS WERE BELIEVED TO BE HELD 
THE PENTAGON SAYS THE LETTERS WERE MADE BY HUMANS BUT IT DOESN'T KNOW WHO MADE THEM 
AND OF ALL THE MILLIONS OF SQUARE KILOMETERS OF TERRITORY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA THAT WE'VE EXAMINED OVER THE YEARS WE REALLY ONLY HAVE TWO UNEXPLAINED SETS OF SYMBOLS WHICH WERE CLEARLY INTENDED TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING TO AN OBSERVER FROM ABOVE 
BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED 
THE COMMITTEE RELEASED OTHER PICTURES SHOWING LETTERS NUMBERS AND ARROWS BUT ANDREWS SAYS THOSE SYMBOLS WERE NOT MADE BY HUMANS 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JOHN KERREY ACCEPTED THAT BUT VICE CHAIRMAN BOB SMITH WASN'T BUYING IT 
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG 
MR. CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NOT DETERMINED THAT 
THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT I'M MAKING 
WE HAVE NOT HAD ALL OUR PEOPLE LOOK AT IT 
PRECISELY 
WELL THEN WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IT 
WHY ARE WE HERE 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW AS WE SIT HERE TODAY THAT IT IS IN FACT A SYMBOL AND I WILL NOT BE PARTY TO FALSELY RAISING HOPES 
IT MAY NOT BE A SYMBOL 
LET'S BE HONEST 
AND IT MAY BE 
DESPITE DOUBTS ABOUT SOME OF THE PICTURES AN OFFICIAL WHO HELPED TEACH SURVIVAL SKILLS TO THE TROOPS SAYS THE U. S. SHOULD NOT STOP LOOKING 
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T SET THIS ASIDE 
WE OUGHT TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS SERIOUSLY AS AN FROM AN INDIVIDUAL AS A POSSIBLE WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE HIS EXISTENCE TO US 
THE COMMITTEE IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATION 
IT WILL HOLD HEARINGS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS FRIDAY TO DIG DEEPER INTO THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE INTELLIGENCE PHOTOS 
MEANWHILE RETIRED GENERAL JOHN VESEY THE PRESIDENT'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR M. I. A. SLASH P. O. W. AFFAIRS IS ON HIS WAY TO HANOI FOR MORE DISCUSSIONS ON THE FATE OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AMERICANS LAST KNOWN ALIVE BUT WHO NEVER CAME HOME
