WE HAVE A LIVE UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THOSE PARTS OF THE MIDWEST STILL BEING BATTERED BY THE FLOODING MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
C. N. N. CORRESPONDENT BRIAN CABELL IS SPENDING AT LEAST PART OF THE DAY IN ILLINOIS 
BRIAN 
BOB THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS HERE IN ILLINOIS 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN NO FATALITIES 
THERE HAVE BEEN A CASUALTY OR TWO 
IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY A BARBER SHOP OWNER WAS WORKING STRUGGLING TO SAVE HIS BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN EXHAUSTION 
HE'S BEEN TOLD TO GIVE IT A REST 
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE SANDBAGS OVER HERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE OUT HERE ARE STILL TRYING TO SAVE THEIR HOMES AND THEIR SHOPS BUT THEY'RE NOT HAVING TOO MUCH LUCK 
THE ENTIRE DOWNTOWN AREA HERE IN ILLINOIS HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY UNDERWATER FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS 
THE LEVEE BROKE ABOUT TWO DAYS AGO WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVER SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN RISING EVER SO SLIGHTLY 
THE DOWN THERE IS UNDER ABOUT EIGHT FEET OF WATER KITCHEN UNDER ABOUT FIVE FEET OF WATER THE BARBER SHOP OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT THAT TOO UNDER ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF WATER 
ALL OF DOWNTOWN IS SHUT DOWN 
ONLY ONE STORE IS OPENED UP AND THEY WILL STAY OPEN AS LONG AS THEY CAN 
WITH ME RIGHT NOW THIS IS CARROLL REID A LONG TIME RESIDENT 
CARROLL THIS IS THE WORST FLOOD YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED HERE ISN'T IT 
YES SIR IT IS 
YOU'VE BEEN HERE HOW MANY YEARS 
ALL MY LIFE 
WHAT ABOUT SIXTY FIVE 
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE GREAT FLOOD OF SIXTY FIVE 
OKAY THE FLOOD OF SIXTY FIVE AS FAR AS IT CAME UP WAS IN THE DITCH RIGHT WHERE YOU SEE THE TRUCK ROUTE SIGN 
THE WATER WAS JUST IN THE DITCH 
THAT'S AS FAR AS IT CAME UP 
KIND OF DISCOURAGING ISN'T IT 
VERY DISCOURAGING 
ARE PEOPLE MOVING OUT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT MOVING OUT 
I TALKED TO TWO FAMILIES THIS MORNING THAT SAID THAT THEY WERE MOVING OUT YES 
AND YOURSELF YOU'RE HIGH AND DRY AT THIS TIME 
WELL AT THE PRESENT TIME MY HOME IS I'M STILL IN THE FLOOD PLAIN HERE BUT MY HOME IS DRY 
I DO HAVE WATER IN THE BASEMENT YES 
IT WAS A SEWAGE BACKUP BUT MY SON AND I GOT IT OUT LAST NIGHT AND SO BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY IN MY BASEMENT AT THE PRESENT TIME 
WHAT ABOUT LIVING BY THE MISSISSIPPI 
THE MISSISSIPPI IS WHAT MAYBE TWO HUNDRED YARDS DOWN THE BLOCK FROM US 
ISN'T THAT DISCOURAGING 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY LET'S MOVE ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED YARDS BACK 
WHY DO YOU STAY HERE 
THAT I CAN'T ANSWER 
I MEAN LOVE OF THE RIVER 
THIS BARRICADE YOU SEE WAY DOWN THERE THAT'S FIVE BLOCKS FROM HERE 
BUT YOU LOVE THE RIVER 
YES 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO STAY 
OH YEAH I'LL STAY 
BUT IF MY HOUSE GOES UNDER NO I WILL NOT STAY 
IT'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO RAISE ANOTHER FOUR FEET BEFORE I GET MY FLOORS COVERED 
LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED ON THAT ONE 
BUT I'VE BEEN IN THE FLOOD OF FIFTY TWO SIXTY FIVE SIXTY NINE SEVENTY TWO AND THIS ONE 
THAT WAS THE MAJOR ONE 
THE FLOOD OF NINETY THREE IS THE WORST THEN 
OH DEFINITELY 
MR. REID THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED THAT YOUR HOME WILL STAY DRY 
LET ME JUST TELL YOU ONE GENTLEMAN TOLD ME ABOUT AN HOUR AGO THAT HE LOVES THE RIVER TOO 
THE RIVER IS LIKE A FRIEND 
YOU GET ALONG WITH YOUR FRIEND MOST OF THE TIME BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU HAVE AN ARGUMENT 
AND THEY HAVE HAD AN ARGUMENT HERE THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND NATURE HAS WON OUT
