DOES TALENT RUN IN THE FAMILY 
IN THE CASE OF THE THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE YES 
FLEDGLING DIRECTOR DAVID HAS A FILM IN THEATERS NOW CALLED MIAMI 
DAVID'S BROTHER OPERATES IN A DIFFERENT MEDIA ARENA AND THEIR FATHER IN YET A THIRD 
C. N. N. ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT BILL TUSH INTRODUCES US TO THE FAMILY 
A FORMER T. V. WRITER TURNED FILM DIRECTOR THAT'S DAVID 
MEET BROTHER JON 
FORMERLY A SPORTSCASTER THIS NOW A REPORTER ON THE TODAY SHOW 
VERY TOUGH ASSIGNMENT JON AND YOU'RE GETTING PAID FOR THIS 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TOMORROW 
WE'RE GOING TO GO 
SOUNDS FUN 
FATHER IS MAX 
WHEN HE WAS AN EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES HE FOUND HIMSELF WINNING A PULITZER PRIZE 
I THINK BASICALLY THE FIRST THING THAT PUSHED ME TOWARD BROADCASTING AS OPPOSED TO WRITING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHERE THE FAMILY ROOTS WERE WERE THAT I WAS SOMEBODY WHO TALKED 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE NO TALENT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA YOU'D BETTER GET BEHIND THE CAMERA PRETTY QUICK 
DAVID HAS A DIPLOMA FROM HARVARD AND BEFORE DIRECTING HIS FIRST FEATURE MIAMI HE FOUND WRITING AND PRODUCING FOR TELEVISION PERFECTLY FINE 
BUT HE KNEW FILMMAKING WAS IN HIS FUTURE EVEN BEFORE HE GOT TO THE FOURTH GRADE 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN THIRD GRADE BUT I DIRECTED JON IN A FILM OF AND THE AND JON PLAYS THE IN A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE ONE OF THE GREAT DEATH SCENES IN CINEMA HISTORY 
BUYING THE FARM WAS HIS FILM FINALE 
HE FOUND PLAYING FOOTBALL FOR SYRACUSE FUN BUT IT WAS WHEN THE FAMOUS BOB COSTAS CAUGHT SPORTS REPORTING THINGS REALLY STARTED TO FLY 
NOW HE'S A AT THE TODAY SHOW AND YOUNG COULDN'T FIND A BIGGER FAN THAN BROTHER DAVE 
IN CLIMBING YOU NEED THE AGILITY OF A AND THE FOCUS OF A CHESS PLAYER 
I THINK HE'S A REAL T. V. STAR 
HE HAS SOME CHARISMA THAT MAKES EVERYBODY ENJOY WATCHING HIM 
MEANWHILE JON SEES DAVID HAVING HIS OWN FABULOUS FEATURE 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY HIM AS ONE OF THE TRUE SUPERSTARS OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF MOVIEMAKING 
IT'S A REAL LOW PRESSURE FAMILY WHERE WE HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS OF EACH OTHER AT ALL 
YOU CAN BET IF EITHER ENDS UP IN A HALL OF FAME NO ONE WILL BE MORE PROUD THAN THEIR FATHER 
WE SEE HIM WANDER DOWN IN HIS UNDERWEAR TO TUNE INTO THE TODAY SHOW SO HE WON'T MISS A SECOND OF JON AND HE YOU KNOW DROVE ME OVER TO THE THEATER THE OTHER DAY TO SEE THE LINES AROUND THE CORNER FOR MIAMI 
FOR NOW EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE FOR THE FAMILY FRANKLY
