WHILE OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON TALK FOLKS IN THE MIDWEST ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN 
C. N. N.'S MIKE CAPPS JOINS US FROM JEFFERSON CITY MISSOURI 
MIKE 
WELL NATALIE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW IS A FLOODED JEFFERSON CITY MISSOURI 
YOU'RE SEEING THE MISSOURI CAPITOL HERE IN JEFFERSON CITY AND THE MISSOURI RIVER IS TWO MILES OUT OF ITS BANKS WELL OUT OF CONTROL AND THE PEOPLE HERE ARE BRACING FOR A CREST OF ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN TO THIRTY EIGHT FEET SOMETIME ON SATURDAY 
WITH ME IS MAYOR LOUISE GARDNER AND THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST FLOOD IN THIS CITY'S HISTORY 
YES IT IS 
BEFORE THIS IT WAS IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE BUT THIS IS MUCH WORSE 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO WE ATTENDED AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MEETING THIS AFTERNOON AND CHARACTERIZE A FEW THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE AS YOU PREPARE FOR THIS CREST 
WE HAVE NATIONAL GUARD COMING IN TO HELP DIRECT TRAFFIC BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT AND THERE ARE SOME STREETS CLOSED AT THIS TIME 
WE ARE BRINGING EXTRA FOOD FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND WE HAVE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY JUST ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS AIRPORT THIS IS NORMALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON CAMERA NOW IS NORMALLY A DRY FIELD 
HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THIS AIRPORT PROPER 
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH WATER BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I WAS OUT ON THE RUNWAY THE OTHER DAY AND IT WAS TEN FEET DEEP SO THIS IS HOW MUCH WATER AND OUR WHOLE AIRPORT AREA IS COVERED AS WELL AS A LOT OF FARM AREA AROUND IT 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SCENE I'M GOING TO CRAWL OUT OF THIS BOAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW AND GO OVER AND TALK TO A BUSINESS OWNER HERE WHO'S BEEN EFFECTED BY THIS HIGH WATER 
WE'VE SEEN IN THE MIDWEST ALL DURING OUR TOUR OF DUTY HERE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST BUILDING THEIR OWN LEVEE SYSTEMS AND WITH ME IS TOM WHO OWNS AN EQUIPMENT COMPANY A FARM EQUIPMENT COMPANY 
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE SIGHT HERE 
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO BUILD THIS LEVEE 
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR I GUESS THE BETTER PART OF TWO WEEKS 
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE HELP US 
THE CITY HAS HELPED US A LOT 
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS CHURCH GROUPS ONE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL ELIAS HIGH SCHOOL HELPED US OUT A LOT 
WE PROBABLY GOT 
UP KNOW EIGHT THOUSAND NINE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND SANDBAGS 
ARE YOU PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT'S GOING TO HOLD BACK THIS CREST 
WE 
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BAG FOR THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE FEET AND THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO 
THEY'RE STILL PREDICTING A THIRTY SEVEN OR THIRTY EIGHT FOOT CREST AND IF IT COMES THAT HIGH WE CAN'T HOLD IT 
YOU'VE STILL GOT WORKERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BUILDING WORKING 
WHAT ARE THEY WHAT ARE THEY DOING 
WE'RE GETTING EQUIPMENT OUT 
WE'VE GOT IT UP TO HIGHER GROUND 
NOW WE'RE MOVING UP AGAIN 
WE'VE STILL GOT PEOPLE GOING WE'VE GOT PLACES AROUND TOWN WHERE WE'RE WORKING AT 
WHAT ABOUT THIS AIRPORT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT LIKE THIS BEFORE OBVIOUSLY 
NO THIS IS THIS IS JUST YOU KNOW FIVE TEN FEET HIGHER YOU KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T EVER DO THIS 
HOW ABOUT MORALE IN THIS PART OF JEFFERSON CITY 
IS IT GOOD IS IT BAD 
OH I THINK IT'S GREAT RIGHT NOW 
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK AFTER THINGS GO DOWN BUT EVERYBODY'S EVERYBODY'S SURE HELPED US A LOT 
THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING IS VERY IMPRESSIVE 
WHAT DID YOU DO AROUND THERE 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN IT IS HERE THE LEVEE SYSTEM 
WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS HIGHWAY FIFTY FOUR RUNS TO OUR BUILDING 
IF THE WATER WOULD COME OVER TOP OF FIFTY FOUR WE THINK THEY'D BE A BIG CURRENT INTO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING AND WE HOPE TO DIVERT THAT SO WE DON'T HAVE THE CURRENT INTO THE GLASS AND INTO THE FRONT STRUCTURE 
WE HOPE TO SAVE THE BUILDING THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE STORY HERE FROM JEFFERSON CITY 
AGAIN IT'S A SCENE WE'VE SEEN ALL UP AND DOWN THE MIDWEST AS WE'VE FOLLOWED THIS FLOOD 
FARMERS FLOODED OUT BUSINESSES FLOODED OUT HOMEOWNERS FLOODED OUT AND THE QUESTION IS JUST HOW HIGH THIS WATER WILL GO THIS MISSOURI RIVER WILL GO WHEN IT FINALLY CRESTS
