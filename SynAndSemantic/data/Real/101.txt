MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE THEY MAY BE DENIED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR A PRE EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITION 
BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT JUST THE SUSPICION OF CERTAIN AILMENTS MAY COST YOU HIGHER PREMIUMS OR LOWER COVERAGE 
GREG LEFEVRE HAS MORE 
SHE CAN'T GET MEDICAL INSURANCE BECAUSE HER MOTHER HAS HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE AND SHE MAY CARRY THE SAME GENES 
I HAVE A FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE OF HAVING IT 
SHE HIDES HER IDENTITY BECAUSE IF HER EMPLOYER FINDS OUT SHE MAY LOSE HER JOB TOO 
SHE'S NOT SICK 
SHE SUFFERS INSTEAD SHE SAYS FROM GENETIC DISCRIMINATION 
IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT I AM AT RISK OF HAVING THIS DISEASE THEN MY COMPETENCY WILL BE IN QUESTION 
AND THUS YOUR JOB 
ABSOLUTELY 
A STUDY REVEALED IF YOUR GENES SHOW A DISPOSITION TOWARD A CERTAIN DISEASE YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY MAY CANCEL YOU YEARS PERHAPS DECADES BEFORE YOU GET SICK IF YOU GET SICK AT ALL 
THE GENERAL TREND IN INSURANCE HAS BEEN TO INSURE ONLY THOSE WHO ARE HEALTHY AND TO EXCLUDE OR RATE OR MAKE INSURANCE UNAFFORDABLE TO THOSE WHO ARE EITHER SICK CURRENTLY OR WHO ARE DEEMED AT RISK FOR BECOMING SICK IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
FOUND NINETY THREE CASES OF SO CALLED GENETIC DISCRIMINATION 
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SAYS NO COMPANY USES GENETICS TO EXCLUDE APPLICANTS BUT SOME DO CONSIDER THE DATA 
JUST BECAUSE CERTAIN INFORMATION COMES OUT OF A GENETIC TEST THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A CANDIDATE WILL BE REJECTED 
IT MAY MEAN A DIFFERENCE IN PREMIUM 
SAYS GENETIC INFORMATION SHOULD BE USED TO TREAT PATIENTS NOT TO REJECT THEM 
THE INSURERS AND THE INSURED WOULD THEN SEE IT IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO TAKE CHEAP MEASURES WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ILLNESS 
IF THIS WOMAN DOES GET SICK SHE SAYS THE SYSTEM SHE PAYS TO PROTECT HER WILL INSTEAD ABANDON HER 
A CARRIER WILL NOT ACCEPT MY APPLICATION 
BECAUSE OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY 
BECAUSE OF MY FAMILY HISTORY 
SO FAR SCIENTISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ONLY ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF HUMAN GENES 
THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OPPOSES GENETIC TESTING AS A TOOL BY EMPLOYERS TO SCREEN POTENTIAL WORKERS 
CRITICS OF GENETIC TESTING SAY IT INVITES PREJUDICE 
WHAT IF SOCIETY HAD KNOW JOHN KENNEDY WAS GOING TO HAVE DISEASE 
OR GEORGE BUSH 
AND WHAT WOULD THE SAY ABOUT PRESIDENT CLINTON'S APPETITE FOR HAMBURGERS
