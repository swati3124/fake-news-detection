YIELDS ON CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT HAVE BEEN WITHERING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND NOW UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS A NEW KIND OF C. D. COULD ADD MORE YIELD AND THEREFORE MORE MONEY TO YOUR ACCOUNT 
TERRY KEENAN HAS THE DETAILS THERE 
TO PERSUADE CUSTOMERS TO SAVE AT TODAY'S INTEREST RATES BANKS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE BEING FORCED TO COME UP WITH NEW PRODUCTS 
ONE OF THOSE INNOVATIONS SO CALLED RISING RATE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT 
INVESTORS START OUT WITH A FIXED RATE ON THEIR C. D. BUT THEY CAN RAISE THAT RATE ONCE INTEREST RATES RISE 
ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF BANKS OFFER RISING RATES AMONG THEM WELLS FARGO IN CALIFORNIA 
IT ALLOWS A ONE TIME BUMP UP ON TWELVE MONTH C. D.'S MINIMUM INVESTMENT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS 
AT BAND IN LOUISIANA YOU CAN RAISE THE RATE ONCE IN TWO YEARS MINIMUM INVESTMENT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
UNITED SAVINGS IN TEXAS LET'S YOU MOVE YOUR RATE UP ONCE ON AN EIGHTEEN MONTH ACCOUNT MINIMUM INVESTMENT THERE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
AND FOR A MINIMUM INVESTMENT OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FIRST TIER BAND IN OMAHA OFFERS A ONE TIME INTEREST RATE CHANGE ON ITS TWENTY FOUR MONTH TRADE UP C. D. 
RISING RATE OR BUMP UP C. D.'S AS THEIR CALLED APPEAR TO OFFER AN ATTRACTIVE COMBINATION SAFETY PLUS FLEXIBILITY 
BUT THESE C. D.'S WORK BEST WHEN RATES ARE RISING NOT FALLING AS IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW 
THAT'S BECAUSE RISING RATE C. D.'S USUALLY BEGIN WITH RATES SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN FIXED RATE ACCOUNTS AT OTHER BANKS 
TO MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL MOVE UP TO OVERCOME THE INITIAL LOWER RATE 
IF YOU STILL WANT A RISING RATE C. D. FIND OUT HOW THE RATE IS COMPOUNDED 
FOR INSTANCE DAILY COMPOUNDING IS BETTER THAN QUARTERLY 
AND OF COURSE BE SURE THE BANK IS FEDERALLY INSURED 
THERE'S NOT MUCH SENSE IN A HIGH YIELDING ACCOUNT THAT MAY NOT BE THERE WHEN IT'S TIME TO COLLECT 
THAT'S YOUR MONEY TERRY KEENAN C. N. N. BUSINESS NEWS NEW YORK

COMING UP NEXT MONEY MAGAZINE'S MARLYS HARRIS ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 
NOW WHERE ARE THE BEST PLACES TO SELL RARE STAMPS AND WHERE DO YOU GET START UP CASH FOR NEW BUSINESSES 
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT MONEY MAGAZINE'S MARLYS HARRIS IS SET TO ANSWER 
HELLO AGAIN MARLYS 
HI STUART 
LET'S GET GOING 
THE FIRST QUESTION COMES TO US FROM ANN ROBERTSON WHO WRITES FROM AMARILLO TEXAS 
A COLLECTION OF RARE UNUSED QUALITY STAMPS APPRAISED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FOR NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT WERE THEN SOLD SEVEN YEARS LATER FOR ONLY A THIRD OF THAT 
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT SUCH STAMPS SHOULD BE SOLD IN THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND NOT IN THE U. S. TRUE OR FALSE 
THE IDEA OF MAKING MORE MONEY ON STAMPS BY SELLING THEM IN THEIR ORIGINAL COUNTRY IS BEING BANDIED ABOUT BUT IT IS FALSE ACCORDING TO STAMP EXPERTS 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN YOUR STAMP COLLECTION WAS APPRAISED THE U. S. MARKET WAS GOING GANGBUSTERS 
RAMPANT INFLATION HAD MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SO CALLED HARD ASSETS GOLD SILVER LAND AND COLLECTIBLES WERE SAFER THAN CASH 
BUT WHEN INFLATION DIMINISHED IN THE EARLY EIGHTY'S SO DID INTEREST IN HARD ASSETS SO THE STAMP MARKET CAME AND FELL UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE 
THAT'S WHY THE COLLECTION SOLD FOR SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT 
IF YOUR STAMP IS RARE IN INTEREST AND COLLECTORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL BID ON IT AND IF IT'S FROM A NON INDUSTRIAL NATION IT WILL PROBABLY MORE MONEY HERE IN THE U. S. THAN AT HOME 
RIGHT NOW ACCORDING A SWISS STAMP EXPERT THE BEST MARKET IS IN EUROPE WHERE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE A LOT TO SPEND 
BUT HE ADDS THAT A STAMPS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS COLOR RARITY HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE AND BEAUTY TO NAME A FEW ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS POINT OF ORIGIN 
FAIR ENOUGH NEXT QUESTION COMES TO US FROM WILSON OF CHICAGO ILLINOIS 
SHE ASKS ARE THERE BUSINESS LOANS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T INVEST MUCH THEMSELVES 
I'M A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD BLACK WOMAN WHO WOULD LIKE TO OPEN A SALON 
I FIGURE I COULD GET ROLLING WITH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION WILL GIVE ME A BIG LOAN BUT THAT WOULD PUT ME IN OVER MY HEAD BEFORE I EVEN START
