ROSS PEROT IS WRAPPING UP A MINI TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES 
HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR ANYTHING THIS TIME HE'S JUST RUNNING AGAINST WASHINGTON AND HE COULD THROW A WRENCH IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS 
SUSAN KING REPORTS 
PEROT'S LAST STOP A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE'S FIRST STOP NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE HE WHAT SOUNDS LIKE AN ANTHEM FOR NINETY SIX 
HERE IS OUR GOAL 
WE'RE GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE RUSH TO BIG GOVERNMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
IS THAT A GOOD GOAL 
AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT TO A SCREECHING HALT IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX O. K. 
TWO WEEKS TREKKING POLITICAL AMERICA TRYING TO ENERGIZE HIS WITHERING UNITED WE STAND ORGANIZATION BEFORE MID TERM CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS ROSS PEROT SOUNDS LIKE A MAN RUNNING AGAINST PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON 
AS YOU THINK ABOUT HAITI WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER DIE FOR HAITI 
WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY TO HAITI 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
THE ROLE THAT'S HE'S OBVIOUSLY PLAYING IS AS A LEADER OF AN ANTI CLINTON MOVEMENT WHICH HAS THE SAME PURPOSE AS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT IS SEPARATE FROM THE REPUBLICANS 
I THINK HE'S MORE FORCEFUL WHEN HE'S ANTI WASHINGTON THAN WHEN HE'S ANTI BILL CLINTON 
I THINK WHAT VOTERS LIKE ABOUT HIM IS THE AGENDA AND THE PERSPECTIVE THAT HE 
ROSS PEROT'S NOT GOING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
WHAT HE IS GOING TO BE THOUGH IS SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS ALMOST UNIQUELY TO THIS SWING PART OF THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE 
AND IN THIS CHAOTIC MID TERM ELECTION YEAR SWING VOTERS ARE CRITICAL 
THEY COULD PRODUCE A NEW CONGRESSIONAL EQUATION OUSTING DEMOCRATS WHO CONTROL THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND ELECTING NEW FACES MOSTLY REPUBLICANS 
A FORMER PEROT FOR PRESIDENT POLLSTER THINKS THEY WILL 
EVEN THOUGH ROSS PEROT'S NAME IS NOT ON THE BALLOT HE MAY TURN OUT TO BE AS MUCH OF A FACTOR AS BILL CLINTON 
IF THAT MEANS ROSS PEROT BECOMES THE REPUBLICAN HERO IN NOVEMBER BY HELPING TO RESTORE THEM TO POWER IN CONGRESS HE IS FAR FROM THE G. O. P. POLLSTER BOY BECAUSE IF HE MAKES ANOTHER RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE MANY IN THE PARTY FEAR HE MAY CONFUSE POLITICALLY LOYALTIES SO MUCH THEY'LL HELP PRESIDENT CLINTON MORE THAN HURT HIM
