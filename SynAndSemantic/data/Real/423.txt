PHILIP MORRIS TO LEAVE BIG APPLE OVER SMOKING BAN 
ON WALL STREET THE DOW INDUSTRIALS GIVING THEIR FIRST WINNING PERFORMANCE IN A WEEK INVESTORS APPARENTLY PUTTING THE BEST FACE ON A CAUTIOUS SITUATION 
BLUE CHIPS CLIMBING DESPITE ANXIETY THAT FEDERAL RESERVE POLICYMAKERS TOMORROW COULD BOOST INTEREST RATES FOR THE SIXTH TIME THIS YEAR 
FOLLOWING A DAY OF NARROW TRADING THE DOW INDUSTRIALS FINISHED WITH A GAIN OF SEVENTEEN AT A LEVEL OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
THE BLUE CHIPS LOST MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED POINTS LAST WEEK ON FEARS OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES 
HIGHER INTEREST RATES DEFINITELY HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE HOUSING MARKET 
THE CLIMB IN MORTGAGE RATES COOLING DEMAND FOR EXISTING HOMES 
SALES FALLING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN AUGUST THE THIRD DECLINE IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS 
LOOKING OUT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS I THINK CLEARLY THE WORST IS YET TO COME BECAUSE YOU'VE USED UP PENT UP DEMAND BY PEOPLE TRYING TO RUSH IN AHEAD OF THE INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES 
THE PROBABILITIES ARE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO GIVE US ONE AND MOST PROBABLY TWO RATE INCREASES BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR 
HIGHER INTEREST RATES ALSO THREATEN TO SLOW THE MORTGAGE REFINANCING BUSINESS WHICH IS ALREADY LIMPING FROM EARLIER RATE HIKES 
THAT WEAKNESS HAS MADE MORTGAGE COMPANIES RIPE FOR TAKEOVER AND THE CONTINUE 
TWO MORE TODAY IN FLORIDA BARNETT BANKS ACQUIRING FOR THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND BANK AMERICA BUYING NEW YORK BASED MORTGAGE FIRM ARBOR NATIONAL FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS 
WALL STREET UNIMPRESSED WITH THAT OFFER WHICH MANY CALLED LOW 
ARBOR NATIONAL STOCK LOSING FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS TO FIFTEEN AND THREE QUARTERS 
SURGING FOUR AND SEVEN SLASH EIGHTS TO TWENTY NINE AND ONE HALF 
EASTMAN KODAK WORKING A DEAL OF ITS OWN SHUTTING MORE OF ITS NON PHOTOGRAPHIC BUSINESS 
KODAK SELLING ITS HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS LINE TO BRITAIN'S RACKET AND COLEMAN FOR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS 
THE SUBSIDIARY PART OF KODAK'S L. AND F. PRODUCTS DIVISION MAKES HOUSEHOLD BRANDS MOP AND GLOW AND RESOLVE CARPET CLEANER AMONG OTHERS 
THE ONLY BIG BUSINESS LEFT ON KODAK'S NON PHOTO SHELF L. AND UNIT THAT MAKES AND WOOD TREATMENT PRODUCTS 
PHILIP MORRIS THROWING AN EARLY SCARE AT NEW YORK CITY THE FOOD AND TOBACCO GIANT REPORTEDLY THREATENING TO LEAVE THE BIG APPLE IF NEW YORK WENT THROUGH WITH A SMOKING BAN IN RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES 
KITTY PILGRIM JOINS ME NOW WITH THAT REPORT 
KITTY 
JAN ACCORDING TO MORNING NEWSPAPER REPORTS PHILIP MORRIS WAS PLANNING TO VACATE ITS POSH PARK AVENUE DIGS AND TAKE TWO THOUSAND JOBS WITH IT BUT BY MID MORNING THE MARLBORO MAKER FAXED A STATEMENT SAYING IT NEVER THREATENED TO LEAVE THE CITY IT WAS MERELY CONSIDERING THE OPTION 
AT CITY HALL THE SIGNS WERE CLEAR NEW YORK IS ON THE VERGE OF BANNING ALL SMOKING IN RESTAURANTS 
CITY COUNCILMAN WILLIAMS TRIED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON HEALTH IN HEATED HEARINGS THAT SWARMED WITH P. R. REPRESENTATIVES FROM EVERY POSSIBLE INDUSTRY 
THIS IS NOT AN ANTI BUSINESS BILL 
THIS IS A HEALTH BILL 
IT CONCERNS THE HEALTH OF THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK CITY AND SECONDARY SMOKE AS SOME OF THE TESTIMONY RECEIVED DOES HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE CITIZENS OF THIS CITY 
WHILE THE CONTESTANTS WERE SMOKING MAD THE BATTLE LINES WERE ANYTHING BUT CLEAR 
RESTAURANT OPPOSITION IS ACCUSED OF BEING IN THE POCKET OF BIG TOBACCO 
WE'RE CONVINCED THAT IF ADOPTED IT MEANS POTENTIALLY AS MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT LOSS IN BUSINESS TO NEW YORK'S RESTAURANTS AND TAVERNS AND NEW YORK IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGN VISITORS TO OUR CITY WHO HAVE DIFFERENT SMOKING HABITS THAN SAY OTHER AMERICANS 
BUT NOT ALL AGREE RESTAURANT BUSINESS WOULD BE LOST 
ACCORDING TO STUDIES BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO SMOKE FREE ORDINANCES IN FIFTEEN COMMUNITIES IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES SHOWED VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON RESTAURANTS 
BUT ON TOBACCO SALES THE SAME RESEARCHERS SAY NEW YORK CITY'S CIGARETTE SALES COULD FALL BY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
CIGARETTE BANS DO CUT SMOKING 
FOR EXAMPLE SMOKE FREE OFFICES USUALLY FORCE ONE QUARTER OF THE WORKFORCE TO QUIT AND OTHERS TO CUT CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION BY TWENTY PERCENT 
NEW YORK IS NOT THE FIRST CITY WHERE SUCH A BAN IS BEING CONSIDERED BUT THE BATTLEFIELD HERE IS A BIG ONE AND MANY BELIEVE AS THE BIG APPLE GOES SO WILL THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
