IT'S GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PEOPLE DON'T READ AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO 
INDEED IT SEEMS THE CLOSEST AN ENTIRE GENERATION GETS TO A BOOK THESE DAYS IS WHEN ONE IS TURNED INTO A T. V. MOVIE OF THE WEEK 
YOU'D THINK THAT WOULD BOTHER AN AUTHOR OF THE STATUS OF KURT VONNEGUT BUT AS MARK BAILEY REPORTS VONNEGUT FEELS HIS WORK TRANSFERS QUITE WELL FROM WORDS TO VISUALS 
HELLO I'M KURT VONNEGUT 
MY FATHER WAS AN ARCHITECT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I MYSELF HAVE DESIGNED THIS STRUCTURE SOMETHING LIKE THIS EXCEPT I'VE PROVIDED SOMETHING THAT ARCHITECTS DON'T PROVIDE WHICH IS A WORLD BEHIND EACH DOOR 
WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE AND THE LATEST STORIES IN THE ANTHOLOGY BY THE SAME NAME TO BE TURNED INTO TELEVISION FOR 
UNLIKE MANY AUTHORS WHO FEAR THAT HOLLYWOOD ONLY SERVES TO TRIVIALIZE SERIOUS WRITING VONNEGUT WELCOMES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIS WORK PERFORMED ON SCREEN 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH OBVIOUSLY 
REALLY NOT VERY NICE OR GIFTED PEOPLE BUT I'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY AND I HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE TWO NOVELISTS THAT OUGHT TO BE CRAZY OVER HOLLYWOOD I'M ONE OF THEM BECAUSE THE JOB THEY DID ON SLAUGHTER HOUSE FIVE 
VONNEGUT THAT THE OTHER IS MARGARET MITCHELL GONE WITH THE WIND HAVING HELD UP FAIRLY WELL 
FOUR NEW OF 
Y. HOUSE ARE SET TO AIR ON BEGINNING WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH AN EPISODE TITLED FORTITUDE 
IN IT VONNEGUT EXPLORES JUST HOW FAR MAN AND TECHNOLOGY SHOULD GO TO PROLONG LIFE 
THIS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS SO WEALTHY SHE'S LEFT A BILLION DOLLARS THAT SHE CAN HIRE THE BEST MEDICAL HELP AVAILABLE 
AND SO FINALLY THE STORY OPENS AND SHE'S NOTHING BUT A HEAD ON TOP OF A POST AND THERE'S THIS HUGE ENGINE ROOM DOWN BELOW WHICH IS HER KIDNEY OR LUNGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
A TOPIC TORN FROM TODAY'S HEADLINES 
NOT HARDLY 
VONNEGUT WROTE FORTITUDE IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE 
FUTURE EPISODES OF MONKEY HOUSE PROMISE THE SAME TYPE OF BITING SOCIAL COMMENTARY FAITHFUL TO THE AUTHOR'S ORIGINAL WORK 
AND IF HIS FANS HAVE ANY DOUBTS VONNEGUT SUGGESTS THEY TRY SOMETHING REALLY BOLD FOR THE NINETIES READ THE BOOK 
I'M VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE REMAINS IN PRINT AND IT'S A USUAL EXPERIENCE FOR AUTHORS TO WRITE SOMETHING AND HAVE IT SINK LIKE A STONE AFTER A YEAR OR A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AND THEN THE MOVIE BECOMES THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORK OF ART AND SO THE WRITER GETS HYSTERICAL BUT I WROTE THE BOOKS YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I DO
