WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES LARGELY EXCLUDED FROM STUDIES 
IS THERE EQUALITY BETWEEN THE SEXES 
NOT WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL TREATMENT 
FOR EXAMPLE HEART DISEASE IS THE LEADING KILLER OF AMERICAN MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN BUT MOST TREATMENT IN WOMEN IS BASED ON STUDIES DONE IN MIDDLE AGED WHITE MEN 
WOMEN SHOULD NEVER HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN CLINICAL TRIALS 
UNTIL THIS YEAR THE U. S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT ALLOW STUDIES TO INCLUDE WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE 
WOMEN SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO TAKE MEDICATIONS THAT HAVE ONLY BEEN INVESTIGATED IN MIDDLE AGED MEN 
PHYSICIANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ASSUME WOMEN'S SYMPTOMS ARE DUE TO EMOTIONAL RATHER THAN PHYSICAL CAUSES 
WOMEN SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO BE THIRD AND FOURTH AND FIFTH CLASS CITIZENS WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE 
THE NINETEEN SIXTY'S IN AMERICA A TURBULENT TIME A TIME OF DRAMATIC CHANGE 
ANOTHER MOVEMENT WAS UNDER WAY 
WOMEN BEGAN SHARING EXPERIENCES ABOUT THEIR HEALTH TO THEIR BODIES AND RAISE CONSCIOUSNESS 
SOME DISCOVERIES REFLECTED AVAILABLE MEDICAL INFORMATION BUT THERE WERE HUGE GAPS 
THE CONCEPT WAS SHARED WITH WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD AND THE FIRST FEMINIST WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTERS WERE FORMED 
THIS FEMINIST WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER IN ATLANTA IS ONE OF THIRTEEN IN THE COUNTRY 
TODAY THEY STILL OFFER WOMEN HEALTH SERVICES IN A FEMALE CONTROLLED SETTING 
HELLO 
I'M RHONDA ROWLAND 
THIS BOOK OUR BODIES OURSELVES IS CONSIDERED A TYPICAL SELF HELP BOOK TODAY BUT WHEN IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IT WAS REVOLUTIONARY 
MANY BELIEVED THIS BOOK AND THESE CENTERS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE WOMEN'S HEALTH MOVEMENT THOUGH SOME DISAGREE AND AS WE'LL SHOW YOU THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO 
THE YEAR IS NINETEEN NINETY 
A U. S. GOVERNMENT STUDY FINDS WOMEN ARE LARGELY EXCLUDED FROM SCIENTIFIC STUDIES 
EVEN THOUGH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH HAD A POLICY TO INCLUDE WOMEN AS SUBJECTS MANY RESEARCHERS DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT 
THAT YEAR THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN'S HEALTH WAS ESTABLISHED AT N. I. H. 
MANY BELIEVE THESE EVENTS SIGNALED THE START OF THE WOMEN'S HEALTH MOVEMENT 
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING 
I BELIEVE OF COURSE THAT THE WOMEN'S HEALTH MOVEMENT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD TO START BECAUSE THERE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GENDER DISPARITY 
THE WOMEN'S HEALTH MOVEMENT IS ALL ABOUT RIDDING AMERICAN MEDICINE OF GENDER DISCRIMINATION 
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS TO DEFINE GENDER DISCRIMINATION AS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN AMERICAN MEDICINE WAS BUILT ON A MALE MODEL OF DISEASE 
WAS IT THAT NO ONE THOUGHT THAT WOMEN WOULD GET SICK OR NEEDED TO BE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED WITH MEDICATIONS 
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WE MEANING WE WOMEN HAVE WAITED SO LONG TO SPEAK UP AND ASK FOR WHAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW AND THAT IS WHAT ARE THE RIGHT ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BODY 
WHAT EXACTLY IS WOMEN'S HEALTH 
ADVOCATES SAY IT'S STILL EVOLVING BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S DEFINITION ONLY FOCUSES ON DISEASES OR CONDITIONS UNIQUE MORE PREVALENT OR MORE SERIOUS IN WOMEN 
THE WORD MAN OR MEN DOESN'T APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE DEFINITION AND YET IT'S THERE BEHIND EVERY PHRASE 
SHE SAYS HOW IT'S ULTIMATELY DEFINED CAN DETERMINE WHICH STUDIES GET FUNDED 
DAN FEELS ISSUES CRITICAL TO WOMEN SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RAPE AND PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM LOW SELF ESTEEM NEED TO BE INCLUDED 
SELF ESTEEM IS ONE OF THE CLEAR GENDER DIFFERENCES 
WE KNOW THAT WOMEN DON'T THINK OF THEMSELVES DON'T VALUE THEMSELVES AS MUCH AS MEN FROM SOMEHOW LEARN TO DO 
THE HEALTH OF A WOMAN TO ME MEANS THAT SHE'S GOT SPIRIT GOOD MENTAL CAPABILITIES GOOD BODILY FUNCTIONS 
SO HOW CAN WOMEN GET THESE NEEDS MET 
SOME ADVOCATES BELIEVE A NEW MEDICAL SPECIALTY LIKE THAT FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE OR PEDIATRICS IS THE ANSWER 
A SINGLE PHYSICIAN WHO'S TRAINED TO HANDLE ALL OF A WOMAN'S HEALTH NEEDS 
DOCTOR KAREN JOHNSON A SAN FRANCISCO PSYCHIATRIST IS LEADING THIS MOVEMENT 
WE HAVE TO REALLY MAINSTREAM WOMEN'S HEALTH MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CURRICULUM 
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS CREATE A SPECIALTY 
IF WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIALTY IN WOMEN'S HEALTH WE DO NOT HAVE WOMEN'S HEALTH IN MEDICINE 
ALL OF THE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES ARE MEN'S SPECIALTIES EXCEPT FOR OB SLASH GYN WHICH IS STILL VERY MUCH OF A MALE MODEL SPECIALTY IN TERMS OF HOW IT VIEWS WOMEN 
THOSE OPPOSED TO A NEW SPECIALTY SAY THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH OF THESE NEW PHYSICIANS TO GO AROUND AND ARGUE IT WOULD MARGINALIZE WOMEN'S HEALTH CREATE ANOTHER POORLY PAID SPECIALTY AND ABSOLVE OTHER PHYSICIANS FROM LEARNING ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH 
WE STILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE FRAGMENTATION OF WOMEN'S HEALTH AND WE STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY MEDICAL SPECIALIST OR IS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SENSITIVE TO WOMEN'S HEALTH NEEDS AND CONCERNS 
A SPECIALTY 
I DON'T KNOW BUT CERTAINLY WE NEED QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN AND THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH THAT 
THE BEST WAY TO DELIVER WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE IS STILL BEING DEBATED BUT WOMEN'S HEALTH LEADERS SAY FEMALE PATIENTS ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
THEY NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS GET SECOND OPINIONS AND BE INFORMED 
WHEN WE RETURN MEDICAL STUDENTS HELP FUEL THE FIRE FOR A NEW CURRICULUM
