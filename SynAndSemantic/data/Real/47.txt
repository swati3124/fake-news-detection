JAPAN'S GOVERNMENT IS GIVING SOME PLOTS OF LAND AWAY AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO LURE YOUNG PEOPLE BACK TO THE FARM LIFE 
C. N. N.'S EILEEN O'CONNOR REPORTS 
THE LAND OF THE RISING SUN NURTURED NOT BY THE YOUNG BUT BY THE OLD 
MICHIKO WAS BORN IN THE ERA MASAKO WAS TOO 
THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR GRANDCHILDREN TO SEW THESE FIELDS AND KEEP THE LAND AS IT IS AND AS IT WAS FOR GENERATIONS 
MY SONS TELL ME DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE LAND JUST LEAVE IT SAYS MICHIKO BUT BOTH OF THEM WORK FOR COMPANIES 
SO IT IS LEFT TO THE ELDERLY TO WORRY AND CARE FOR THIS LAND 
MASAKO KNOWS THE OF A GOOD HARVEST AND THE PLEASURE OF LIVING WITH NATURE 
WE HAVE NO CHOICE SHE SAID 
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANT 
BUT THAT CHOICE IS WORRYING EVEN THE GOVERNMENT 
ON SOME AREAS LAND IS BEING GIVEN AWAY TO LURE THE YOUNG BACK TO THE EARTH 
JAPAN HAS ALWAYS SUBSIDIZED ITS FARMERS SO AS NOT TO RELY ON OUTSIDERS FOR RICE 
BUT IT MAY BE THAT MONEY ALONE WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT SELF IN THE FUTURE FOR IT IS PEOPLE THAT ARE NEEDED 
WHEN I WAS A SMALL CHILD I HELPED MY PARENTS PLANT THE RICE BY HAND SAYS MICHIKO ONE BY ONE 
NOW IT IS MACHINERY THAT RUNS IN THE FIELDS NOT THE CHILDREN 
BUT STILL THE ELDERLY BELIEVES THAT TRADITION WILL NOT DIE THAT THE ERA OF THE JAPANESE RICE FARMER IS NOT OVER YET
