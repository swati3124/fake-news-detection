LIVE FROM WASHINGTON CROSSFIRE 
ON THE LEFT MIKE KINSLEY 
ON THE RIGHT PAT BUCHANAN 
TONIGHT NANNYGATE 
IN THE CROSSFIRE JUAN WILLIAMS COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON POST 
AND IN LOS ANGELES ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED 
GOOD EVENING 
WELCOME TO CROSSFIRE 
WASHINGTON SPENT THE WEEKEND IN NANNYGATE 
ON FRIDAY A SECOND WOMAN JUDGE KIMBA WOOD LOST HER CHANCE TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL AFTER IT EMERGED THAT SHE HAD HIRED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN TO CARE FOR HER CHILD 
ON SUNDAY COMMERCE SECRETARY RON BROWN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NOT PAID SOCIAL SECURITY FOR HIS THREE HOUR A WEEK CLEANING LADY 
SO WHY SHOULD BROWN A MAN GET TO KEEP HIS JOB 
IS THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION GUILTY OF A DOUBLE STANDARD 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
FOR ONE THING THIS ISSUE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ANYONE TO MAKE IT AN ISSUE UNTIL ZOE BAIRD VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSED IT 
SO NO ONE KNEW SO NO ONE WAS SUBJECTED TO A DOUBLE STANDARD 
WHILE SOME FEMINISTS ARE ANGRY AT CLINTON FOR DUMPING KIMBA WOOD SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE SAYING THIS TROUBLE SERVES HIM RIGHT FOR INSISTING ON A WOMAN AND CRITICS OF ALL STRIPES ARE WONDERING IF THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WILL EVER GET ITS ACT TOGETHER 
GLORIA ALLRED IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU SHOULD BE FURIOUS A KIMBA WOOD NOT AT BILL CLINTON 
SHE IS THE REASON SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS NOT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER NANNY 
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT SHE TRIED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
THREE TIMES SHE WAS ASKED DO YOU HAVE A ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM SHE DIDN'T SAY WELL NOT REALLY LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE SHE SAID NUMBER NOW THEY DECIDED WHEN THE FACTS FINALLY CAME OUT THAT THEY HAD BEEN SNOOKERED AND THEY CAN'T TRUST HER 
ISN'T THAT PERFECTLY REASONABLE 
NO IT ISN'T AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN BLAMING THE VICTIM MICHAEL 
SHE EXERCISED HER JUDGMENT 
SHE TOLD THEM SHE DID NOT HAVE A ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM 
SHE ACTED AT ALL TIMES LAWFULLY 
SHE DID ALL THE FILING ALL THE DISCLOSURE PAID ALL THE TAXES DID MUCH MORE THAN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DO I MIGHT ADD AND I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUSLY UNFAIR TO TRY TO PUNISH HER NOW BUT SAYING THAT SHE DIDN'T DISCLOSE 
WE HAD AN ADMINISTRATION THAT SAID READ MY LIPS 
I DON'T WANT AN ADMINISTRATION NOW THAT SAYS READ MY MIND 
BUT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF READING THE ADMINISTRATION'S MIND 
IT'S A QUESTION OF READING KIMBA WOOD'S MIND 
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WHEN SHE SAID NO TO THAT QUESTION DO YOU HAVE A KIMBA WOOD PROBLEM SHE WAS HIDING INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD AND THEY HAD A RIGHT TO HAVE BEFORE THEY MADE THAT DECISION WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THE DECISION THEY MAKE OR NOT 
I THINK THERE'S A MISCOMMUNICATION HERE BUT I DO THINK THAT THE BURDEN SHOULD BE ON THE ADMINISTRATION TO FULLY ARTICULATE WHAT ITS QUESTIONS ARE WHAT ITS CONCERNS ARE AND IF IT HAD THIS CONCERN THEN IT SHOULD HAVE FULLY ARTICULATED SHE SHOULDN'T BE BLAMED FOR NOT HAVING TRIED TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO FIND OUT 
OH COME ON 
YOU MEAN TO SAY WHEN THEY SAID TO HER DO YOU HAVE A ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM IT NEVER CROSSED HER MIND TO MENTION THE FACT THAT SHE'D HIRED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN EVEN THOUGH FOR TECHNICAL REASONS IT WAS LEGAL 
WELL IT WAS LEGAL AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN LEGAL AND IF THEY HAD POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT THEY WERE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE ARTICULATED THEM 
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT RON BROWN HAS PAID HIS SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES LATE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS WAS NOT LEGAL FOR HIM TO DO AT THE TIME THAT HE FAILED TO PAY 
NOW HE'S TAKING CARE OF THE PROBLEM 
I'M GLAD THAT HE HAS BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO LOSE HIS POSITION ON ACCOUNT OF IT BUT SHE UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT ENJOY THE POSITION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 
EXACTLY 
SOLELY ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAS DONE EVERYTHING LEGALLY 
EXACTLY GLORIA WELL STATED 
JUAN DOES SHE NOT HAVE A POINT 
KIMBA WOOD DOES NOT HAVE A ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM BUT RON BROWN DOES 
FOR YEARS RON BROWN HAS NOT PAID THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES ON HIS HOUSEHOLD WORKER AND HE'S NOT IN ANY TROUBLE AND KIMBA WOOD HAS BEEN BOUNCED 
WAIT THIS IS NOT A DOUBLE STANDARD BY ANY MEANS 
YOU DRAW IT UP AS IF IT'S AN EQUAL EQUATION HERE WITH TWO THINGS OF EQUAL WEIGHT ON EITHER SIDE 
IN FACT IT'S NOT 
IN FACT RON BROWN WENT THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS 
THIS ISSUE WAS NOT RAISED BECAUSE THE FLAGS HAD NOT GONE UP IN WASHINGTON AROUND THIS ISSUE OF ILLEGAL ALIENS HIRED AS HELP 
JUAN I'M NOT PUTTING AN EQUAL SIGN BETWEEN THEM 
I'M SAYING KIMBA WOOD DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG IN HANDLING HER NANNY FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS HER BABYSITTER AND RON BROWN HAS DUCKED PAYING SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES 
HIS SITUATION IS WORSE THAN HERS IS WHAT I'M SAYING 
HE GOT THROUGH 
HE'S NOT IN TROUBLE 
SHE'S OUT 
DON'T TELL ME THAT'S NOT A DOUBLE STANDARD 
THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF IT 
NUMBER 
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT IN THIS TOWN YOU GO THROUGH PERIODS WHERE CERTAIN ISSUES BECOME AN ABSOLUTE YELLOW FLAG IN TERMS OF CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 
AT THE MOMENT THAT YELLOW FLAG IS UP FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOMEHOW HIRED ILLEGAL ALIENS OR NOT PAID THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES AS THE LAW THEM TO DO 
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE WHEN BROWN WENT THROUGH 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RON BROWN NOW 
NO I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT BROWN BROKE THE LAW 
BROWN HAS MADE FOR HIS PROBLEM AND SAID THAT HE WAS WRONG BUT IT'S JUST THE CASE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONFIRMATION 
GLORIA THREE WOMEN WENT THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS BEFORE ZOE BAIRD AND LIKE THE MEN INCLUDING RON BROWN WHO WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS THEY WERE NOT ASKED ABOUT THEIR DOMESTIC HELP OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
IT WASN'T AN ISSUE THEN 
SINCE THAT TIME ZOE BAIRD HAS BECOME AN ISSUE 
MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT IT 
CHARLES A VERY DISTINGUISHED ATTORNEY HERE IN WASHINGTON WHO WAS ON THE SHORT LIST FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL GOT BOUNCED 'CAUSE HE HAD A SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM 
HE'S A MAN 
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN ARGUE THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD 
WELL THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD BECAUSE THE FIRST VICTIMS WERE WOMEN AND THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY TO BE HURT BY ALL OF THIS ARE WOMEN 
THERE ARE SINGLE PARENTS MILLIONS OF THEM IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE TRYING TO BE CREATIVE EVERYDAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT BY THE WAY IS BECAUSE OF TWELVE YEARS OF ABSOLUTE NEGLECT OF THE CHILD CARE CRISIS BY THE REAGAN AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT WOMEN IN THIS POSITION AND THERE IS GOING TO BE A VERY DEFINITE IMPACT ON WOMEN 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR NOW 
ONLY WOMEN WHO HAVE LIVED IN 
WAIT A SECOND 
MS. ALLRED LET ME JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION 
ISN'T IT THE CASE THAT ZOE BAIRD WAS THE ONE WHO RAISED THIS 
NOBODY WENT TO HER AND SAID ZOE WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHILD CARE SITUATION SHE VOLUNTEERED THIS INFORMATION UNDERSTANDING THAT IT COULD COMPROMISE HER AS THE LEADING OFFICIAL OF JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES AND SAID IF THIS IS A PROBLEM LET ME KNOW. WELL THE WHITE HOUSE ESSENTIALLY SAYS NO BIG DEAL IT'S O. K. WITH US 
PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE SAID NO BIG DEAL BUT IT TURNS OUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAID IT WAS A BIG DEAL 
WHY WOULD YOU BLAME PRESIDENT CLINTON FOR THAT 
I DON'T BLAME PRESIDENT CLINTON BUT I DO ASK FOR LEADERSHIP BY PRESIDENT CLINTON 
WE HEARD OF STAND BY YOUR MAN WELL I'D LIKE HIM TO STAND BY HIS WOMAN 
WAIT A MINUTE 
I'D LIKE KIMBA WOOD TO BE THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WAIT A MINUTE 
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS GLORIA 
GLORIA YOU DO AGREE WITH ME THAT THE DOUBLE STANDARD IS PEOPLE WHO HAPPENED TO BE CONFIRMED ZOE BAIRD VERSUS PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO BE CONFIRMED AFTER HER IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR SEX AND MEN AND WOMEN OF BOTH SEXES THAT ABOUT COVERS IT HAVE BOTH BEEN CAUGHT 
ALMOST EVERYBODY 
THEY'RE CAUGHT IN THE GEARS AFTERWARDS AND GOT AWAY WITH IT BEFOREHAND 
SO IT MAY BE A DOUBLE STANDARD BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION 
KIMBA WOOD WASN'T GETTING AWAY WITH ANYTHING 
THE JUDGE SHOWED THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS BY COMPLYING WITH ALL LAWS AND 
SHE TRIED TO PULL A FAST ONE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
YOU REFUSE TO ADMIT THAT 
WELL I THINK THE FAST ONE IS PERHAPS THE RATIONALIZATION AFTERWARDS FOR WHY HER NAME IS NO LONGER THERE AND UP FOR NOMINATION AS ATTORNEY GENERAL 
O. K. 
AND I JUST THINK THAT IT'S UNFAIR TO VICTIMIZE HER TWICE FIRST BY FORCING HER TO WITHDRAW AND SECOND BY ATTACKING HER AND SOMEHOW SAYING THAT SHE HAD THE BURDEN OF COMING FORTH WITH THIS 
SHE HAD THE BURDEN OF ANSWERING A QUESTION GIVING INFORMATION THAT SHE KNEW DARN WELL THEY WANTED AND SHE PURPOSELY DIDN'T BRING IT FORTH 
ALL RIGHT 
LET ME ASK JUAN A QUESTION 
JUAN YOU'VE MADE THE POINT THAT ZOE BAIRD CAME FORWARD AND INDICATED SHE HAD A PROBLEM 
SHE DID THE RIGHT THING 
WHY DIDN'T RON BROWN DO THAT 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ASKED HIM 
IT WASN'T ON THE TABLE 
BUT YOU JUST SAID THAT ZOE BAIRD CAME FORTH AND DID IT 
ZOE BAIRD 
AND ADMITTED SHE'D DONE SOMETHING WRONG 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND THIS GUY'S A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR BIG TIME LAWYER DIDN'T PAY ANY OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES FOR HIS HELP 
ZOE BAIRD COMES FORWARD AND TELLS THE TRUTH 
SHE'S OUT 
KIMBA WOOD DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 
SHE'S OUT 
RON BROWN COVERED UP HE STAYS IN THE CABINET 
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO THE WOMEN OF AMERICA THAT THERE'S NO DOUBLE STANDARD 
THERE'S NO COVER UP HERE 
AT MOST YOU CAN SAY THERE'S A SIN OF OMISSION 
WHY DIDN'T RON BROWN VOLUNTEER THIS INFORMATION 
MAYBE RON BROWN AT THE TIME WASN'T AWARE THAT HE HAD BROKEN THE LAW 
MAYBE RON BROWN CONSIDERED IN THE WAY THAT ZOE BAIRD AND THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN 
YOU KNOW WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT FOR YOU KNOW IF ED MEESE SAID I WASN'T AWARE THAT WAS THE LAW 
I'D SAY MR. MEESE 
YOU'D MAKE A DEAD RUN TO THE WASHINGTON POST AND YOU'D BE WRITING ALL NIGHT 
YOU GOT IT AND I'D ALSO EXPECT THAT MR. MEESE WOULD MAKE UP FOR IT IN JUST THE WAY THAT RON BROWN HAS DONE AND THAT BOTH THESE MEN HAD BEEN CONFIRMED BEFORE THE ISSUE WAS RAISED 
YOU SEEM TO WANT TO IGNORE THAT 
GLORIA DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU SLIGHTLY SICK TO HEAR PAT BUCHANAN COMING ON HERE AS THE GREAT DEFENDER OF WOMEN AND DON'T YOU FEEL THAT BY RAISING THIS FUSS YOU ARE GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO PEOPLE LIKE PAT AS OPPOSED TO BILL CLINTON WHO'S CLEARLY KNOCKING HIMSELF OUT TO FIND WOMEN FOR HIS CABINET AND HAS DONE A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN PAT'S BOSS OR ANY PRESIDENT THAT EVER CAME BEFORE HIM 
WELL IT DOES MAKE ME SLIGHTLY QUEASY TO BE ON THE SAME SIDE AS PAT BUCHANAN BUT AS THEY SAY POLITICS MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS AND IT COULDN'T BE STRANGER IN THIS CASE BUT I WILL SAY THAT WE DO HAVE TO HOLD THE CLINTONS AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS MUCH AS I SUPPORT THEM AND I DO TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AND WE NEED TO EDUCATE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME SITUATION WITH KIMBA WOOD WHERE SHE DID COMPLY WITH ALL THE LAWS 
KIMBA WOOD DID COMPLY WITH ALL THE LAWS AND ZOE BAIRD DID NOT 
BY THE WAY WHAT ABOUT THE COMPLETE SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE MORAL HYPOCRISY IN WASHINGTON 
I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS OF CABINET APPOINTEES EACH AND EVERY SENATOR EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS OUGHT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THEMSELVES AS TO WHETHER THEY'VE EVER HIRED ANYONE WHO WAS UNDOCUMENTED WHETHER THEY'VE PAID ALL THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES WORKER'S COMP AND ALL THE REST OF IT AND I'LL BET THE ANSWER BY MANY OF THEM WOULD BE NUMBER 
O. K. GLORIA WELL STATED 
HOW SERIOUS IS THE POLITICAL MESS IN WHICH THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE FINDS ITSELF 
THAT ISSUE JUST AS SOON AS WE COME BACK 
WELCOME BACK 
BECAUSE SHE FAILED TO LEVEL WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT HAVING HIRED AN ILLEGAL ALIEN AS A BABYSITTER SEVEN YEARS AGO JUDGE KIMBA WOOD WILL NOT BE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 
KIMBA WOOD DID NOT JUMP SHE WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD BY THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE 
DID THE WHITE HOUSE DO THE RIGHT THING AND WHY CAN'T THEM SEEM TO GET IT RIGHT 
OUR GUESTS IN CALIFORNIA FEMINIST ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED AND HERE IN WASHINGTON JOURNALIST JUAN WILLIAMS OF THE WASHINGTON POST AND SOMETIME CO HOST OF CROSSFIRE 
JUAN WE HAVE HAD A REAL DEBACLE WITH THE ZOE BAIRD THING AND NOW THE KIMBA WOOD THING AND THE MESS OVER ATTORNEY GENERAL 
ISN'T THIS THE INEVITABLE RESULT WHEN YOU TRY TO MAKE THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE A GENDER SET ASIDE FOR FEMINISTS 
WELL I THINK IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF THE BEAN COUNTING CRITICISM I GUESS YOU COULD MAKE THAT COMMENT BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU WANT TO BEAN COUNT ALL WE'VE HAD OVER THERE ARE WHITE MALES PAT AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE IS ON THE CLINTON PART WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN UP THIS PROCESS 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AND SEE IF THERE ARE QUALIFIED WOMEN AND THERE ARE QUALIFIED WOMEN AVAILABLE FOR THAT POSITION 
BUT JUAN WILLIAMS LOOK WHAT MR. CLINTON HAS SAID IN EFFECT IS THAT IF YOU'RE A WHITE MALE LAWYER YOU NEED NOT APPLY FOR MY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
NOW IF ANYONE HAD SAID EXCUSE ME THAT WE DON'T WANT ANY WOMEN APPLICATIONS FOR JUSTICE AND NO BLACK APPLICATIONS FOR JUSTICE YOU WOULD GO BONKERS 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
O. K. 
BUT WHY IS IT O. K. TO SAY THAT ALL THE MEN WHO ARE JUDGES WHITE MALES ALL THE MEN WHO ARE LAWYERS ALL THE MEN WHO ARE HEADING UP LAW DEPARTMENTS AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES THEY ARE UNQUALIFIED THEY ARE OUT OF CONSIDERATION WHY IS THAT RIGHT 
WELL YOU'RE WRONG ON TWO POINTS 
ONE IS NO ONE SAID THAT THERE ARE NOT QUALIFIED APPLICATIONS NOT DESIRED THEY CAN APPLY 
IN FACT JERRY CHUCK OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CERTAINLY APPLIED AND BEEN CONSIDERED 
THE BIG POINT HERE IS THAT OUR HISTORY AS AMERICANS INDICATES THAT WE HAVE HAD DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AGAINST BLACKS AGAINST HISPANICS ASIANS AND THAT THE CLINTON PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS CONSIDERED FOR THESE APPOINTMENTS 
THEY'RE NOT CONSIDERING EVERYONE THEY'RE RULING OUT WHITE MALES 
NO THEY'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT WE HAVE 
WELL YOU DO WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE RULING OUT MEN 
WHEN YOU SAY THAT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GOING TO BE A WOMAN THAT TENDS AS MICHAEL POINTED OUT TO RULE OUT THAT OTHER SEX WHICH IS MALES 
NUMBER 
ARE YOU TELLING ME CHUCK A WOMAN OR JERRY IS A WOMAN 
NO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR THE JOB EVEN AS WE SIT HERE 
THEY WOULD HAVE LISTEN LOOK THE GOVERNOR FORMER IS A FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA IF THEY WEREN'T AFTER A WOMAN HE WOULD BE ATTORNEY GENERAL RIGHT NOW 
WHY ISN'T HE 
WHAT'S WRONG WELL I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO ASK GLORIA ALLRED WHAT'S WRONG WITH LOOKING FOR A WOMAN 
LET ME PUT IT THE OTHER WAY TO YOU GLORIA 
ONCE AGAIN YOU SEE HOW YOU'RE FALLING RIGHT INTO PAT'S TRAP HERE 
CLINTON SAID I DON'T THINK HE EVER SAID I INSIST ON HAVING A WOMAN 
WHAT HE SAID IS I'M GOING TO BE MORE IMAGINATIVE AND MORE ENERGETIC IN SEEKING A DIVERSE CABINET AND HE DID THAT 
THAT TAKES RISKS WITH IT 
YOU TEND TO GO TO NAMES THAT ARE NOT AS WELL KNOWN AS OTHER NAMES AND YOU END UP WITH SOME SETBACKS AS HE'S HAD 
WOULD YOU BLAME HIM IF AT THIS POINT HE SAID I AM GOING TO GO FOR THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS JUDGE OR LAW SCHOOL DEAN I CAN FIND AND IF THAT'S A MAN SO BE IT 
ABSOLUTELY 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A WOMAN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL 
LOOK THIS HAS BEEN A MEN'S CLUB IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME 
IT'S TIME TO BREAK THROUGH THE GLASS CEILING IN GOVERNMENT 
GOVERNMENT IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE NATION 
IT SETS THE MORAL TONE AND PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS GOT TO SHOW LEADERSHIP AND HAVE A WOMAN IN THERE 
WE CAN'T HAVE ONLY THREE WOMEN IN THE CABINET OUT OF FOURTEEN POSITIONS 
THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD 
WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER THAN THAT AND WE HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE MORE AND THAT'S IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
YOU KNOW BUT MS. ALLRED 
THE IDEA THAT THE ONLY WOMAN THAT CAN BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS A LAWYER IS THE WIFE OF THE PRESIDENT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE 
THIS IS NINETEEN NINETY THREE WE NEED AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO'S A WOMAN 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE MS. ALLRED IS THAT IN FACT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ZOE RECORD OR WHEN YOU COME FORWARD AND LOOK AT KIMBA WOOD'S RECORD YOU SEE THAT IN FACT THEY'RE PRETTY CONSERVATIVE IN MANY OF THE POSITIONS THEY'VE TAKEN 
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT ZOE BAIRD AT AETNA AND THE KIND OF POSITIONS SHE WAS TAKING ANTI LITIGATION AND SO FORTH ALONG DAN QUAYLE LINES AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT BUSH APPOINTED KIMBA WOOD TO THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY I THINK THAT IN FACT YOU NEED WOMEN WHO HAVE MORE LIBERAL CREDENTIALS DON'T YOU 
WELL I LIKE THAT 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF FEMINIST WOMEN LAWYERS AND WOMEN JUDGES OUT THERE 
THERE'S THE NATIONAL WOMEN JUDGES ASSOCIATION 
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF NAMES WE COULD PROVIDE ANYTIME FROM THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S POLITICAL CAUCUS 
WE HAVE PROVIDED NAMES 
LET ME ASK YOU GLORIA THE QUESTION THAT PAT CAN'T ASK YOU 'CAUSE OF OUR FORMAT TONIGHT 
IF YOU HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO AGREED WITH YOUR VIEWS ABOUT LEGAL ISSUES AND HAPPENED TO BE A MAN OR SOMEONE WHO DISAGREED WITH THEM AND HAPPENED TO BE A WOMAN WOULD YOU REALLY PICK THE WOMAN 
THOSE ARE FALSE ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE I WANT A WOMAN WITH FEMINIST VIEWS 
YOU WANT YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO 
WHO BELIEVES IN WITH A RECORD OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND CONSUMER RIGHTS AND THERE ARE MANY WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WILL FIT THAT DESCRIPTION 
AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE A NANNY PROBLEMS 
LET ME GET TO YOU JUAN ON THE THIS IS THE LARGER THING 
REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T REALLY GONE AFTER BILL CLINTON 
HE IS STUMBLING ALL OVER THE LOT 
I MEAN IS THIS JUST AS CASEY CAN'T ANYBODY HERE PLAY THIS GAME 
IS THIS JUST A COUPLE OF MISTAKES OR IS THIS ENDEMIC IN THIS ADMINISTRATION 
IT'S IN TROUBLE 
WELL THEY'RE IN TROUBLE 
THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE COMING OUT OF THE BOX BUT I THINK THAT IT'S QUICK TO CONDEMN ANYBODY 
I MEAN 
I'M NOT CONDEMNING THEM 
THEY'RE 
THEY'RE JUST HERE 
I MEAN THEY'RE JUST GETTING SET 
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THEIR STAFFING 
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE PHONES TO WORK 
IT IS EVERY I MEAN THESE AREN'T THIS ISN'T PAT BUCHANAN CONSERVATIVE JOURNALISTS ARE SAYING IT'S THE WORST START UP OF ANY ADMINISTRATION THEY CAN EVER RECALL 
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM 
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY WHEN REAGAN WAS STARTING AND WHAT DID THEY SAY WHEN BUSH WAS STARTING 
IF THEY ALWAYS SAY IT IT'S THE SAME OLD CANT WE'RE IN THE SAME TOWN 
IT'S LIKE TRIBAL RITES MY GOODNESS 
AND ONCE AGAIN GLORIA AREN'T YOU GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THESE SORTS OF THINGS BY RAISING A FUSS OVER CLINTON WHEN THE BLAME REALLY GOES IN THIS LAST I MEAN I AGREE WITH THE ZOE BAIRD THING HE BLEW IT HE MADE A MISTAKE OF JUDGMENT BUT I CANNOT SEE WHAT HE DID WRONG IN THIS KIMBA WOOD THING WHEN SHE KEPT THE CRUCIAL FACTS SECRET FROM HIM 
NO I MEAN WOMEN HAVE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP SILENT FOR MANY YEARS FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS AT LEAST 
OH WAIT NOW THERE'S A WAR 
OH WAIT NOW THERE'S AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM 
JUST BE SILENT AND FINALLY SOMEONE WILL ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS LATER WHEN IT'S MORE CONVENIENT WHEN THERE'S A BETTER TIME 
NO THIS IS A TIME WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IT AS WE GO ALONG AND I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL DO THEIR BEST TO HAVE A FEMINIST WOMAN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT WE'VE GOT TO ALSO REALLY HAVE A STRICT SCRUTINY OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THE PROCESS AS WE GO 
ALL RIGHT 
LET'S TAKE A BREAK AND WHEN WE COME BACK WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER LITTLE CORNER OF THIS KIMBA WOOD BUSINESS THE PLAYBOY BUNNY SCANDAL 
GLORIA ALLRED SOMEHOW IT LEAKED OUT DURING THIS MESS LAST WEEK THAT KIMBA WOOD THIRTY YEARS AGO HAD SPENT A FEW DAYS TRAINING TO WORK IN A PLAYBOY CLUB IN LONDON 
NOW I DON'T FIND THAT IN ANY WAY A BAD THING ABOUT KIMBA WOOD 
I DON'T THINK YOU DO 
JUAN DOESN'T 
I'LL BET EVEN PAT BUCHANAN DOESN'T 
SO WHY ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THAT 
WELL I THINK THAT PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE SUSPECT THE PRESIDENT'S MOTIVES THAT THEY THINK THAT MAYBE THIS WAS THE REAL FLAP THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AND DIDN'T WANT TO BE SUBJECTED TO JOKES ON LATE NIGHT TALK SHOWS ABOUT HAVING A PLAYBOY BUNNY OR MAYBE 
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE 
A AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 
MAYBE THAT WAS THE REAL REASON 
I DON'T KNOW 
MOST PEOPLE I KNOW 
SEEMS UNLIKELY DOESN'T IT 
DON'T EVEN CARE IF SHE BECAME A PLAYBOY BUNNY WHICH SHE NEVER DID 
BUT YOU KNOW WHY THE POINT IS THAT THIS OBVIOUSLY WAS LEAKED OUT BY THE CLINTON PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND LOOK WHAT SHE DID TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD WORKING AS WHETHER IT WAS A IN A PLAYBOY BUNNY CLUB IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR A LAUGH FOR ONE NIGHT AT THE TALK SHOW HOST BUT NOBODY WAS GOING TO WITHHOLD APPROVING HER ON THAT GROUND 
OF COURSE NOT 
SO WHAT IS THE ACCUSATION AGAINST THE CLINTON PEOPLE 
THE CLINTON PEOPLE LEAKED IT OUT 
NOBODY KNEW THAT 
ISN'T THAT RIGHT 
YEAH THE CLINTON PEOPLE LET IT OUT BUT THAT'S THE POINT IS HERE THE CLINTON PEOPLE WERE SAYING HERE'S THE ENTIRE RECORD 
THIS WOMAN HAD NOT BEEN FULLY TRUTHFUL WITH US ABOUT THE ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM 
WE'RE PUTTING IT ALL OUT IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT WEIGHED AGAINST HER IN OUR MIND 
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK 
THEY WERE DEFENDING A DECISION THEY KNEW WAS INHERENTLY AND MAYBE EVEN COWARDLY TO DUMP THE WOMAN 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
THEY DUMPED HER AND THEN THEY WANTED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES 
WE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE 
OH COME ON PAT 
THEY DUMPED HER 
SURE THEY DID 
SHE EVENTUALLY CAME FORWARD WITH INFORMATION THEY WERE UNAWARE OF AND PUT THEM IN A COMPROMISING POSITION 
AND THEY PANICKED AND DUMPED HER 
THEY COULD HAVE GOT HER THROUGH 
ALL RIGHT 
WE'LL GET TO THAT AT THE END PAT 
I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT BUT LAST QUESTION TO GLORIA 
AREN'T THINGS THAT CLINTON HAS ALREADY DONE AS PRESIDENT LIKE LIFTING THE ABORTION GAG RULE AND PUSHING THROUGH THAT FAMILY LEAVE BILL FAR MORE IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN THAN THIS LITTLE FUSS OVER KIMBA WOOD 
WELL I THINK IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT ALL OF THE ABORTION RIGHTS LEGISLATION THAT HE SIGNED AND ORDERED AND ALL OF THE FAMILY LEAVE BILL WHICH WE'VE STRUGGLED SO LONG TO GET INTO LAW AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT IT'S STILL VERY IMPORTANT THAT WOMEN BE IN THE PALACE OF POWER IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT AFFECT WOMEN'S LIVES BECAUSE OUR DAUGHTERS NEED ROLE MODELS 
WE NEED WOMEN AS LEADERS AND THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR WOMEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
I'VE GOT TO CUT YOU OFF AT THAT POINT 
THANK YOU GLORIA ALLRED OUT IN L. A. THANK YOU JUAN WILLIAMS HERE IN WASHINGTON 
YOU'RE WELCOME 
I'LL EXPLAIN THE FACTS OF LIFE TO PAT IN JUST A MOMENT 
REMEMBER ONE MORE WEEK OF PAT AND THEN JOHN SUNUNU IS BACK FOR A WHILE 
MEANWHILE PAT YOU CALLED CLINTON'S DECISION TO DUMP KIMBA WOOD WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY DID COWARDLY 
WOULD PRESIDENT BUCHANAN HOW WOULD PRESIDENT BUCHANAN REACT IF A CABINET NOMINEE HAD WITHHELD OBVIOUSLY ON PURPOSE INFORMATION THAT SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WAS RELEVANT TO HIS DECISION 
WELL SHE 
AND THEN FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AT THE LAST MINUTE 
SHE BROUGHT IN ALL THESE DOCUMENTS AND THINGS 
I'D TAKE A LOOK AT MY COUNCIL AND I'D MAKE A JUDGMENT 
I WOULD NOT I THINK IT WAS A COWARDLY I THINK THEY CHOKED MICHAEL 
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE PAT YOU'RE SUCH A HYPOCRITE 
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN LIVID AT THIS WOMEN FOR STABBING YOU IN THE BACK AND DENYING YOU THIS 
SHE DIDN'T IT WASN'T STABBING IN THE BACK 
YOU KNOW HE ASKED HER DO YOU HAVE A ZOE BAIRD PROBLEM AND SHE USED A LOT OF TO GET OUT OF ANSWERING THAT QUESTION STRAIGHT 
MICHAEL THEY'RE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THIS IDIOTIC POLICY OF MAKING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
AND YOU'RE EVADING MY QUESTION JUST THE WAY SHE EVADED 
FROM THE LEFT I'M MIKE KINSLEY
