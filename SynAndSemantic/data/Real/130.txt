LIVE FROM WASHINGTON CROSSFIRE 
ON THE LEFT MIKE KINSLEY 
ON THE RIGHT PAT BUCHANAN 
TONIGHT LIFTING THE AIDS BAN 
IN THE CROSSFIRE REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE LAMAR SMITH OF TEXAS MEMBER OF THE IMMIGRATION SUBCOMMITTEE AND MICHAEL COOPERATING ATTORNEY FOR THE CENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 
GOOD EVENING 
WELCOME TO CROSSFIRE 
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE UNITED STATES HAS BANNED PEOPLE INFECTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY 
NO OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SUCH A BAN EXCEPT SOUTH AFRICA 
DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FAVORED LIFTING THE BAN SAYING IT WAS MEDICALLY UNJUSTIFIED BUT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BLOCKED ANY CHANGE 
NOW THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO LIFTING THAT BAN POSSIBLY SOON 
CRITICS SAY LIFTING THE BAN WILL PROMOTE THE SPREAD OF THIS FATAL DISEASE 
THEY ALSO SAY THAT LETTING IN PEOPLE WITH AIDS WILL BE A COSTLY BURDEN ON AMERICAN HEALTH CARE 
WHY THEY ASK SHOULD AMERICA TAKE THAT RISK AND UNDERTAKE THAT COST 
THAT'S THE CROSSFIRE 
PAT 
MR. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO CONTAIN THIS FATAL DISEASE WHY WOULD YOU INTRODUCE INTO THE U. S. NEW SOURCES OF INFECTION 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS PEOPLE COME INTO THE UNITED STATES EVERY SINGLE DAY INFECTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS 
I KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT PREFER TO HAVE PEOPLE TESTED FOR THE AIDS VIRUS AT THE AIRPORT BUT AS IT STANDS PEOPLE HAVE COME IN WITH AIDS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMING IN WITH AIDS AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE DISEASE 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS NOT THE POLITICIANS WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE OUGHT TO DEAL WITH THE AIDS VIRUS 
MR. I THINK WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO IS YOU OUGHT TO TRY ANSWERING THE QUESTION 
THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF A DANGEROUS DEADLY DISEASE WHEN WE ARE TOLD WE ARE ALL AT RISK WHY WOULD YOU KNOWINGLY BRING INTO THE UNITED STATES HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CARRIERS OF THIS INFECTION AND WHO COULD PASS IT ON AND KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS 
YOU JUST SHOWED YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FACTS WHEN YOU SAY WE'RE ALL AT RISK 
I DON'T FEEL I'M AT RISK 
I'M MARRIED AND I DON'T USE DRUGS 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE AT RISK 
THE POINT IS THIS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING IN WITH AIDS AS LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN THE VIRUS 
PEOPLE WILL 
WHY WOULD YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER 
WE AREN'T INCREASING THE NUMBER 
SURE YOU ARE 
YOU'RE GOING TO LET THEM IN EVEN IF YOU KNOW IT 
IT'S THE SAME 
YOU KNOW WHAT 
THEY COME IN ANYWAY AND LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW 
MOST PEOPLE WHO COME INTO THE UNITED STATES ARE NON IMMIGRANTS 
THEY ARE NOT TESTED FOR AIDS 
PEOPLE CAN 
I KNOW THAT 
MR. SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE LAST YEAR WITH AIDS WERE STOPPED AND NOT ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY 
LET'S ASSUME HALF ARE ACTIVE HOMOSEXUALS THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
THEY HAVE TEN CONTACTS A YEAR 
THAT'S THREE THOUSAND OCCASIONS IN ONE YEAR WHEN THOSE PEOPLE COULD PASS THE DISEASE ON 
THAT'S QUITE AN ASSUMPTION QUITE ASSUMPTION 
WELL I MEAN IF YOU READ THE STATISTICS THAT'S QUITE LOW 
QUITE AN ASSUMPTION SIX HUNDRED OUT OF A MILLION IMMIGRANTS 
HOW MANY IMMIGRANTS DID WE HAVE LAST YEAR CONGRESSMAN A MILLION 
WE HAD A MILLION IMMIGRANTS BUT AS PAT JUST SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY WITH AIDS 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE AIDS VIRUS CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND A DRAIN ON THE PUBLIC TREASURY 
WELL CONGRESSMAN 
WAIT A MINUTE 
IT'S A THREAT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE EVERYBODY ADMITS THIS IS A DISEASE THAT IS SERIOUS THAT CAN BE SPREAD THAT CONTINUES TO BE SPREAD 
IT'S A DRAIN ON THE PUBLIC TREASURY BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS COST ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH TO TREAT 
ALL RIGHT 
I THINK YOU'VE RAISED THE TWO ISSUES 
LET'S PUT THE PUBLIC TREASURY ISSUE ASIDE 
NO NO 
JUST FOR A SECOND WE'LL GET BACK TO IT AND TAKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE 
O. K. 
NOW THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CAME OUT TODAY FLATLY IN FAVOR OF LIFTING THE BAN 
THEY SAID THERE'S NO SOUND SCIENTIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH BASIS FOR THIS NOW DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING THE A. M. A. DOESN'T KNOW 
YES I DO AND I KNOW SOMETHING THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW AS WELL AND IT'S CALLED COMMON SENSE 
FOR THEM TO SAY THAT WE CANNOT EXCLUDE PEOPLE WITH AIDS THEY HAVE TO CERTIFY AS THE PRESIDENT HAS TO CERTIFY THAT IT IS NOT A DISEASE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE 
THERE IS I DON'T KNOW OF A SINGLE AMERICAN WHO IS GOING TO SAY THAT 
LOOK DO YOU KNOW CAN YOU NAME ME 
IT'S NOT A DISEASE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE 
LOOK THE A. M. A. IS CERTAINLY WRONG ABOUT SOME THINGS 
BY THE WAY THE A. M. A. 
CAN YOU NAME ME 
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WASHINGTON TIMES DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY 
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WASHINGTON TIMES WAS FLATLY WRONG ABOUT THAT 
THE A. M. A. 
WELL I LIKE TO QUOTE MYSELF FROM THE A. M. A. REPRESENTATIVE 
HERE'S THE PRESS RELEASE 
WELL THE PRESS RELEASE WE HAD TWO DOCTORS AT THE A. M. A. 
A. M. A. SUPPORTS PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE DECISION TO LIFT BAN ON H. I. V. INFECTED IMMIGRANTS 
YOU TALK TO THE PHYSICIANS IN THE FIELD AT THE HOSPITALS WHO HAVE TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY WALK IN THE DOOR AT A COST TO THE UNWILLING AMERICAN TAXPAYER OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 
NAME ME ONE JUST ONE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL OR PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT WHO IS IN FAVOR OF THIS BAN BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE AREN'T ANY 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF POLITICIANS 
WELL WE HAVE LOTS OF DOCTORS 
THEY'RE ALL PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS 
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF THE BAN ARE THOSE THAT ARE HYSTERICAL ABOUT AIDS IN GENERAL 
AND POLITICIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LOT OF CHEAP POINTS 
ON NO NO 
LET ME AGREE WITH HIM ON ONE THING 
I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PROPAGANDA AND HYSTERIA ABOUT AIDS 
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE WE'RE ALL AT RISK BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THIS IS THE TRUTH 
LET'S TAKE TUBERCULOSIS 
IT IS BECOMING EPIDEMIC IN NEW YORK AND OTHER AREAS SO IS HEPATITIS 
THE MAJOR OF TUBERCULOSIS ARE PEOPLE WHO GET AIDS AND THEREFORE BECOME VULNERABLE TO ALL THESE DISEASES AND CARRY THEM AND SPREAD THEM CONTAGIOUS AS WELL AS INFECTIOUS 
WHY WOULD YOU ADD LAST YEAR THEY KEPT OUT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH AIDS WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ADD SIX HUNDRED MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE CARRIERS OF THE AIDS VIRUS AS WELL AS COUNTLESS OTHER DISEASES IF THEY STAY PERMANENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES 
WHY DO IT 
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE REASON 
HOW DOES IT HELP OUR COUNTRY 
YOU ASKED AND LET ME GIVE YOU AN ANSWER 
I REPRESENT A WOMAN WHO'S A U. S. CITIZEN AND HER SON WHO IS AN INTENDING IMMIGRANT HAS AIDS 
ONE REASON WHY WE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT MAN HERE IS SO THAT HE CAN LIVE AND ULTIMATELY DIE IN DIGNITY WITH HIS MOTHER 
IT'S CALLED BEING HUMANITARIAN 
LET ME TAKE THAT ONE 
THE UNITED STATES CANNOT BECOME AN AIDS SHELTER FOR THE WORLD AND IF WE HAVE A POLICY THAT SAYS PEOPLE CAN COME IN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE AIDS THAT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE A LOT MORE THAN THE SIX HUNDRED 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD 
THAT HAVE BEEN COMING IN 
YOU'RE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD CONGRESSMAN 
IT ENCOURAGES THOSE PEOPLE TO COME IN 
WE HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WAITING ON THE LIST TODAY THAT ARE HEALTHY WHY NOT LET THEM IN 
WHY LET THE 
THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION HERE 
YOU KNOW EVEN IF THIS BAN IS LIFTED IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYONE WITH AIDS CAN COME IN 
YOU STILL HAVE TO GET IN AND AS MR. WILL TELL YOU MOST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES CANNOT GET IN 
WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS FAMILY REUNIFICATION CASES 
NO WE'RE NOT 
THOSE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHEN YOU OPEN UP THE DOORS THINK OF YOURSELF AS A PERSON IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY POOR COUNTRY 
YOU CAN'T GET IN 
NO YOU CAN GET ON THE WAITING LIST 
YOU CAN TRY TO GET IN 
NO YOU CAN'T 
CONGRESSMAN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
CONGRESSMAN THERE'S TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY AIDS H. I. V. POSITIVES RIGHT DOWN THERE IN HAITI THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING INTO THE UNITED STATES 
THEY'RE NOT IN HAITI 
EXCUSE ME GUANTANAMO 
THEY'RE IN PRISON IN GUANTANAMO 
THAT'S THE POINT PAT 
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BRING TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE WITH AIDS INTO THE UNITED STATES 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT 
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN TREATING THEM IN CUBA 
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT US FROM AIDS 
WE HAVE THEM THERE 
THEY'RE OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS REFUGEES 
COST EFFECTIVE AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A PERSON 
CONGRESSMAN WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT THESE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY 
LET ME EXPLAIN TO THE VIEWERS WHO THEY ARE 
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AS LEGITIMATE POLITICAL REFUGEES NO QUESTION OF ECONOMIC REFUGEES 
THERE THEY ARE 
THEY CAN'T GO BACK TO HAITI 
WE KNOW THAT 
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO TO THESE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE 
MICHAEL WHY SHOULD THEY BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE REFUGEES WHO WANT TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY 
THEY ARE REFUGEES 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS O. K. THEY ARE REFUGEES 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THEY HAPPEN TO BE AT GUANTANAMO BASE 
WHY SHOULD THEY BE ADMITTED TO THIS COUNTRY TO CONTINUE 
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO TO THEM 
WITH THIS DISEASE OR TO GO 
KEEP THEM IN GUANTANAMO FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES 
THEY'RE GOING TO COST THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER 
THEY'RE GOING TO COST THEY'RE OUR PRISONERS 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TREAT THEM FOR AIDS DOWN THERE 
THEY'RE NOT OUR PRISONERS 
THEY CAME OVER HERE VOLUNTARILY WERE PICKED UP IN THE GULF 
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THEM 
SEND THEM IN 
I'M INTERESTED IN MIKE'S QUESTION 
WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THEM 
I'D SEND THEM BACK 
I WOULD TOO 
I WOULD SEND THEM BACK 
I'D TELL THE MILITARY 
YOU'D VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW 
I'D SEND THEM BACK 
I'D TELL THE MILITARY YOU LEAVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ALONE AND WE'LL HOLD YOU TO IT 
IT'S THE SAME POSITION 
AND THAT'S A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 
THE SAME POSITION AS ANOTHER REFUGEE 
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 
ONE OTHER THING I WANT CLEAR UP 
I DON'T CARE I CARE ABOUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT 
YOU KNOW NOT SOME LAW 
HOLD ON HOLD ON 
GO AHEAD CONGRESSMAN 
AMERICA IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT REJECTS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE AIDS FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES 
NO SOUTH AFRICA 
NO NO NOT SOUTH AFRICA 
I JUST CHECKED WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
THE FOUR COUNTRIES WHO ACCEPT THE MOST LARGEST NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS THE UNITED STATES CANADA AUSTRALIA AND GERMANY ALL HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AIDS 
WE DO NOT HAVE 
THE WESTERN COUNTRIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT DON'T HAVE ANY RESTRICTIONS ARE THE COUNTRIES THAT ACCEPT THE LEVELS OF IMMIGRANTS OF ANY KIND 
I'M SORRY 
CANADA DOES NOT RESTRICT PEOPLE FLATLY FOR HAVING AIDS NEITHER DOES GERMANY 
YES THEY I JUST CHECKED 
IF THEY'RE THERE FOR MORE THAN NINETY DAYS 
WELL THIS IS A FACTUAL QUESTION 
ONE OF US IF WRONG 
WE'LL FIND OUT AFTERWARDS 
BUT LET ME ASK YOU 
WHAT IS THE POSITIVE BENEFIT TO THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY OF BRINGING IN PEOPLE INFECTED WITH A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY AND DISEASE 
YOU'RE NOT BRINGING THEM IN 
MOST OF THEM ARE ALREADY HERE 
WELL NO NO 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION RIGHT NOW 
I'M TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION 
MOST OF THEM ARE EITHER HERE OR THEY'RE COMING HERE TO JOIN FAMILY MEMBERS 
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR COUNTRY FROM AIDS AND I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE WHY WOULD YOU NOT SEND THEM BACK IF THEY MANY OF THEM AS YOU KNOW IF NOT MOST OF THEM GOT THE DISEASE ONE WAY AND IT'S THE SAME WAY THEY CAN TRANSMIT IT 
THEY ARE CARRIERS AND TRANSMITTERS OF THE MOST 
BUT YOU'RE ASSUMING THEY'RE GOING TO TRANSMIT IT 
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT THESE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY HAVE AIDS AND KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO DIE ARE GOING TO GO AND SAY 
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY GOT IT 
YOU CAN'T LOCK THEM UP 
THE LAST THING THAT'S ON THEIR MIND I'M SURE UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME PSYCHOPATH WITH AIDS IS GOING OUT AND INFECTING OTHER PEOPLE 
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN GETTING IT FELLOW 
YOU GOT A MILLION OF THEM 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING 
ARE YOU GOING TO LOCK THESE PEOPLE UP 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PREVENT THEM FROM CONTINUING TO SPREAD AIDS 
LET ME ASK YOU 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MR. CLIENT THE WOMAN WHOSE SON IS DYING OF AIDS WANTS TO COME AND DIE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH HIS MOTHER 
WELL UNDER CURRENT LAW AS MIKE KNOWS UNDER CURRENT LAW IF YOU'RE A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER WHERE YOU'RE COMING FOR A SHORT TERM AS A VISITOR YOU CAN COME INTO THE UNITED STATES 
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING IN AS IMMIGRANTS 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO LET THIS GUY IN 
WHO DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY MEMBERS 
FOR HOW LONG 
FOR THESE FEW PEOPLE HUMANITARIAN REASONS I WOULD LET THEM IN 
THAT'S HOW MANY 
THERE'S PROBABLY SIX HUNDRED OF THOSE 
NUMBER 
THERE'S NOT 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
THAT'S WHO MOST OF THEM ARE 
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND INTERESTING 
YOU GUYS ARE CONSERVATIVES HERE 
THEY CAN COME IN ALREADY 
HOLD ON 
YOU'RE THE CONSERVATIVES RIGHT 
AND CONSERVATIVES ARE OPPOSED TO UNNECESSARY GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND NOT SPENDING MONEY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO AND YOU'RE 
AND YOU'RE THE 
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS IS THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY UNNECESSARILY ON THIS ISSUE 
WE'RE ALSO IN FAVOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND 
AND YOU'RE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND ONE OF THEM IS THE RIGHT TO LIFE 
WHEN WE COME BACK WILL BILL CLINTON OPEN AMERICA'S DOOR TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HAITIANS WHO ARE THERE IN HAITI AND WHO ARE BEGINNING TO KNOCK 
WELCOME BACK 
WE'RE DEBATING THE IMPENDING DECISION OF PRESIDENT CLINTON TO ALLOW H. I. V. POSITIVE IMMIGRANTS INTO THE UNITED STATES 
THE CLINTON SAY IT IS IN OUR TRADITION 
REPUBLICANS SAY THE LIBERALS HAVE LOST THEIR MINDS 
OUR GUESTS REPUBLICAN LAMAR SMITH OF TEXAS WHO IS ON THE IMMIGRATION SUBCOMMITTEE AND MICHAEL IS AN ATTORNEY WITH THE CENTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COST NOW IF WE MAY OF FOLKS AND WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT INDIVIDUALS IMMIGRANTS WHO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY WHO WE KNOW ARE H. I. V. POSITIVE OR HAVE FULL BLOWN AIDS 
WHY SHOULD THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN NATIONAL FAMILY BE HAVE THIS BURDEN IMPOSED UPON THEM OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER AIDS PATIENT WHO COMES INTO THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY'RE HAVING A TERRIBLE TIME TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN PEOPLE 
GENERALLY THEY DON'T AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY 
FIRST OF ALL TO ADMINISTER THE CURRENT LAW THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE CHANGED PROBABLY COSTS MORE JUST IN PURE ADMINISTRATION THAN IT WOULD TO CARE FOR THE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO'VE COME IN WITH AIDS 
SECOND 
WHO HAVEN'T COME IN 
WELL WHO HAVEN'T COME IN AIDS EXACTLY 
HOW COULD IT COST MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A PERSON FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COST 
NO YOU HAVE TO ADMINISTER THE COST FOR ALL THE PEOPLE YOU TEST NOT JUST THE ONES WHO TURN OUT TO HAVE AIDS 
EXACTLY AND PROCESSING ALL THE PAPERS OF IMMIGRATION 
IMMIGRATION HAS A BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET RIGHT NOW CONGRESSMAN 
LET ME EXPLAIN 
THERE'S A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW WITH THE VIRUS ONE MILLION PEOPLE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE COST OF THAT IS ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS PLUS 
NOW ARE WE SAYING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER CAN AFFORD TO PAY THAT AND MORE 
NO WHAT HE'S SAYING CONGRESSMAN IS THAT THE COST OF THIS LAW IS MORE THAN THE COST OF TREATING THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD GET IN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS SILLY LAW 
AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THE CONGRESSMAN 
I DON'T SEE HOW IT COULD BE POSSIBLE 
ONE OTHER THING YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND CONGRESSMAN A LAW THAT YOU FOLKS MADE ON CAPITOL HILL SAYS THAT PERSONS CAN'T IMMIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES OR THEY CAN'T EVEN COME AS VISITORS OR STUDENTS IF THEY'RE LIKELY TO BECOME A PUBLIC CHARGE 
I WAS HOPING YOU'D BRING THAT UP 
YOU KNOW WHY I WAS HOPING YOU'D BRING THAT UP MIKE 
WHY 
BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY KNOW AS I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF THE DANGER THAT THEY MIGHT BECOME A PUBLIC CHARGE IN NINETEEN NINETY THE LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE FIGURES 
ZERO NONE 
NOT TRUE 
NO PEOPLE WERE EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF 
NOT TRUE 
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE 
CONGRESSMAN YOU WANT ME TO HAVE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS 
I JUST CHECKED THIS 
START CALLING YOUR OFFICE TOMORROW 
YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS 
LET'S TALK ABOUT 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE CHECKING 
YOU HAVE SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 
OF COURSE I DO 
NO THE LAW IS MEANINGLESS 
PEOPLE GET TURNED DOWN EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR VISAS FOR LIKELY TO BECOME A PUBLIC CHARGE AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO GET YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND HAVE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS CALL YOU 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT AFTERWARDS 
LET'S TALK ABOUT HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS 
MR. CLINTON HIMSELF HAS BACKED DOWN BEFORE HIS INAUGURATION WHEN THE GREAT BOAT LIFT WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS MAYBE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS POURING INTO FLORIDA 
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD OPEN OUR DOORS TO THAT BOAT LIFT FROM HAITI IF IT INVOLVES TENS OF THOUSANDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HAITIANS 
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN ABIDING BY INTERNATIONAL LAW IN HOW WE TREAT THE HAITIAN REFUGEES 
BY THAT I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE TO BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND SHOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE REFUGEES 
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF OPENING OUR DOORS 
WE HAVE A HISTORY 
MR. 
WE HAVE A HISTORY IN THE CARIBBEAN OF OPENING OUR DOORS TO REFUGEES FROM CUBA 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I REALLY SEE BETWEEN THE CUBANS AND THE HAITIANS IS SKIN COLOR AND POSSIBLY IDEOLOGY 
WELL LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU 
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
FIRST TWENTY PERCENT OF THE CUBANS ARE BLACK WHO ARE REFUGEES 
SECONDLY THEY ARE SHOT IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS IF THEY'RE CAUGHT 
THIRD IF THE HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS ARE POLITICAL REFUGEES IN FEAR OF THEIR LIFE THEY CAN PICK UP AND WALK NEXT DOOR INTO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
THEY DON'T GOT TO GET ON A BOAT AND GO FIVE HUNDRED MILES TO THE UNITED STATES 
YOU JUST SAID YOU WANTED TO SEND A BUNCH OF THEM WITH AIDS BACK TO HAITI WITH SOME BALONEY ABOUT TELLING THE POLICE NOT TO SHOOT THEM 
I SAID NO LISTEN THE UNITED STATES HAS GOT ENOUGH LISTEN I THINK WE OUGHT TO LIFT THE EMBARGO ON HAITI AND NOT DESTROY THE ECONOMY OF THAT LITTLE COUNTRY 
ALL RIGHT 
WE'RE GETTING FAR AFIELD 
LET'S GET BACK TO AIDS FOR A SECOND 
YOU KNOW CONGRESSMAN THIS NOTION THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE FLOODED WITH PEOPLE WITH AIDS LOOKING FOR FREE TREATMENT IF WE LIFTED THIS BAN IS SORT OF HILARIOUS BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DOESN'T SUPPLY GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE 
WHY WOULDN'T THESE PEOPLE FROM THE THIRD WORLD GO TO FRANCE GO TO GERMANY 
MIKE YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I KNOW THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS A REPUTATION FOR PROVIDING THE BEST HEALTH CARE POSSIBLE 
THEY ALSO KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER WILL PICK UP THE TAB 
HAVE YOU EVER 
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS GO INTO A HOSPITAL 
ASKED A FOREIGNER WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT AMERICAN HEALTH CARE 
IF YOU GO TO A HOSPITAL TODAY YOU CHECK WITH ANY PHYSICIAN YOU KNOW AND YOU COME IN AND YOU ARE TESTED AND YOU ARE FOUND TO HAVE AIDS OR HAVE THE AIDS VIRUS YOU ARE DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND THE TAXPAYER PICKS UP THE TAB 
THAT'S WHY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WANT TO COME TO AMERICA 
LET ME TRY ONCE MORE 
WHY WOULD THEY COME TO AMERICA AND NOT TO GERMANY OR FRANCE WHERE THERE'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL NO CONTROVERSY AT ALL AND EVERYONE IS KNOW TO GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE TO EVERYONE 
MIKE FOR ALL I KNOW THEY MAY WANT TO GO TO THOSE COUNTRIES TOO 
ALL WE KNOW IS WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES 
WE HAPPEN TO BE A MECCA FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN'T GET INTO THE UNITED STATES IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER WE HAVE THIS BAN OR NOT 
THAT'S JUST A FANTASY OF YOURS 
BUT MORE ARE GOING TO BE ENCOURAGED IF WE HAVE A POLICY THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU IN 
HOW DO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES MANAGE 
MR. LET'S GET BACK TO WHERE I THINK YOU PROBABLY WILL AGREE WHICH IS LET'S GET BACK TO TUBERCULOSIS AND WE ALL AGREE PEOPLE THAT TUBERCULOSIS BECAUSE THAT'S CONTAGIOUS AS WELL AS INFECTIOUS 
THAT REMAINED 
THAT REMAINS ON THE LIST BUT THE REASON THAT TUBERCULOSIS IS SPREADING AND HEPATITIS ARE SPREADING IS BECAUSE AIDS PATIENTS BECAUSE THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COLLAPSED BECOME VICTIMIZED BY THESE DISEASES 
THEY CONTAIN THEM KEEP THEM THEY CAN'T GET RID OF THEM AND SO THEY SPREAD THEM 
SO IN A SENSE ARE YOU EVEN INVITING A SPREAD OF THE TUBERCULOSIS EPIDEMIC IF YOU ALLOW VOLUNTARILY PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO HAVE AIDS IN THE UNITED STATES 
THE NUMBERS ARE SO INSIGNIFICANT 
YOU TALKED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OUT OF A MILLION IMMIGRANTS AND OUT OF HUNDREDS 
WELL MICHAEL KINSLEY WAS TALKING THE OTHER NIGHT IF JUST ONE LIFE WERE LOST IN A CAR WRECK THEN IT COSTS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO G. M. 
ALL THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT THE TRADEOFF OF COST FOR LIVES 
I SAID OF COURSE THERE'S A TRADEOFF OF COST FOR LIVES 
ALL RIGHT 
HOW MUCH FOR THESE LIVES OF PEOPLE DYING OF TUBERCULOSIS AND AIDS AND THE DISEASE BEING SPREAD IN THE UNITED STATES 
PAT 
YOU KNOW WE HAVE MORE AIDS IN THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
WE ARE EXPORTING AIDS 
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM FOREIGNERS WITH INFECTION IS INSANE 
MIKE MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION 
O. K. 
IN ORDER FOR US TO CHANGE THE POLICY MR. CLINTON HAS TO SAY THAT AIDS IS NOT A DISEASE OF SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPORT 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
DO YOU THINK MOST AMERICANS SAY AIDS IS NOT 
THE DOCTORS SAY SO THE DOCTORS SAY SO 
A DISEASE OF SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPORT 
IT IS NOT IN THE SENSE THAT TUBERCULOSIS IS 
WELL THEN WHY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SPREAD OF IT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES 
WHY ARE WE HAVING SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY 
WHY ARE WE HAVING A DRUG CZAR 
IT'S NOT IN THE SENSE THAT TUBERCULOSIS IS AND EVERY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL AGREES 
WELL NOT IN THE SAME SENSE BUT 
IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS IT'S INFECTIOUS 
LET'S TAKE A BREAK 
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'RE GOING TO WE TALKED ABOUT HAITIANS 
WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT CUBANS 
CONGRESSMAN SMITH YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF TREATING PEOPLE WITH AIDS WHO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AS IMMIGRANTS IF THIS RULE IS LIFTED 
A MILLION PEOPLE COME INTO THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR 
SURELY AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED OF THEM MUST HAVE SERIOUS CASES OF CANCER WHICH IS EQUALLY COSTLY TO TREAT 
SHOULD THEY BE KEPT OUT TOO 
MIKE I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING TO ME HOW MUCH WE SPEND ON RESEARCH FOR AIDS COMPARED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH CANCER 
THAT'S INTERESTING BUT HOW ABOUT ANSWERING MY QUESTION 
NO NO I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION 
WE SPEND FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ON AIDS AS WE DO FOR CANCER AND FIFTY FOUR TIMES AS MUCH ON AIDS AS HEART DISEASE 
GREAT NOW ANSWER MY QUESTION 
O. K. NOW WHY IS IT WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION 
WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO HYSTERICAL ABOUT THE COST OF TREATING PEOPLE WHO COME WITH AIDS WHEN 
I'M NOT HYSTERICAL 
WELL LET ME ASK YOU 
SHOULD WE BAN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE CANCER KNOWING THAT THE MEDICAL TREATMENT MIGHT BE VERY EXPENSIVE 
THE CANCER COSTS AND THE HEART DISEASE COSTS ARE NOT NEAR WHAT THEY ARE WITH AIDS NOR ARE THEY SPREAD THE SAME WAY 
NOT TRUE 
THE OTHER 
OH COME ON 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY THAT YOU'RE HUNG UP ON AIDS 
NO NO 
THE OTHER POINT IS I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD SPEAK UP FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER WHO IS PAYING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL 
AND I'M SAYING WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK UP FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER IN THE CASE OF CANCER 
AND THE OTHER POINT HAS TO GO WITH THE PROCEDURE ITSELF 
THIS THE AIDS WAS PUT ON THE LIST TO KEEP IMMIGRANTS OUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BY ACT OF CONGRESS 
WHY SHOULDN'T WE HAVE A FULL AND OPEN DEBATE IN CONGRESS TO TAKE IT OFF THE LIST 
WHY SHOULD MR. CLINTON GET AWAY WITH IT ON THIS UNILATERAL DECISION 
CONGRESSMAN I JUST SAY THAT I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT YOU AND MR. BUCHANAN ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH 
ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE 
I MEAN YOUR CONCERN THESE GUYS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH ALL OF A SUDDEN 
I'M IN FAVOR OF KEEPING INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC AND IF YOU ARE NOT GO RIGHT AHEAD AND SAY SO IN THE CAMERA 
I SAID THAT I AM TOO BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS OF THE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT I MEAN OUR CLIENTS THAT HAVE IT FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE WOMAN THAT GOT IT AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN HEART SURGERY 
ALL I'M SAYING MR. 
BEFORE SHE GOT HER GREEN CARD AND HER U. S. CITIZEN KID HAS IT TOO 
LET'S SAY IT IS 
SHOULD WE KEEP HER OUT WHEN SHE GOT IT IN SURGERY AT GEORGETOWN 
LOOK IF YOU GOT SIX HUNDRED 
THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD ONE 
IF YOU'VE GOT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE HERE 
SHE GOT IT HERE IN AN OPERATION 
MANY OF THEM MR. IF YOU GOT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE LET'S SAY HALF OF THEM ARE GAY ACTIVISTS 
OH COME ON PLEASE 
WELL HOW DO YOU THINK THEY GET THE DISEASE 
THEY DON'T ALL GET IT FROM TRANSFUSIONS 
MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE WHO DIE ARE GAY ACTIVISTS 
THEY'RE ACTIVISTS 
THEY STILL ARE 
THEY'RE NOT ONLY GAY THEY'RE ACTIVISTS 
THEY'RE ACTIVE GAYS 
MIKE YOU CAN'T 
THEY'RE ACTIVE GAYS 
I SEE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN NOT LETTING THESE INDIVIDUALS IN WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE GOING TO TRANSMIT THE DISEASE WHEN THEY GET HERE 
YOU CAN'T LOCK THEM 
THEY'RE GOING TO 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO HOW DO YOU SAY THEY'RE GOING TO TRANSMIT IT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE 
ALL RIGHT 
THESE TWO GUYS WILL ARGUE OFF THE SHOW AND WE'LL ARGUE ON THE SHOW IN JUST A MINUTE 
THANK YOU CONGRESS SMITH 
THANK YOU MR. 
MY PLEASURE 
WE'LL BE BACK 
THIS IS YOUR LAST REMINDER 
JOHN SUNUNU RETURNS ON MONDAY BUT PAT WON'T BE GOING FAR AND HE'LL BE BACK ON ALTERNATE WEEKS 
PAT 
MICHAEL LOOK IF AIDS IS AN EPIDEMIC AND IT'S A DANGEROUS AND INFECTIOUS AND FATAL DISEASE AND YOU WANT TO MINIMIZE IT TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE IT IS INSANITY TO LET IN YOUNG MALES WHO ARE CARRYING THAT VIRUS WITH THEM IF YOU WANT TO CONTAIN IT 
PAT THE A. M. A. DOCTOR LOUIS SULLIVAN GEORGE BUSH'S H. H. S. SECRETARY EVERY MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL ANTHONY FAUCI WHO'S HIS LIFE TO TRYING TO ERADICATE AIDS THEY ALL THINK THIS BAN IS 
EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THINKS THAT 
ARE THEY CRAZY OR ARE YOU CRAZY 
YOU'RE GIVING UP PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 
I DIDN'T NOTICE AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION 
FROM THE LEFT I'M MIKE KINSLEY
