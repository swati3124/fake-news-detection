GOOD EVENING 
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
WE NEVER QUITE IMAGINED THE NEWS WOULD BEGIN THIS WAY ONE DAY BUT IN THE REALM OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THE FUTURE HAS ARRIVED SOONER THAN MANY PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED 
TODAY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAID IT WAS PERFECTLY LEGAL FOR GENETIC ENGINEERS TO GO AHEAD AND BRING TO MARKET FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WHICH HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY ALTERED TO MAKE THEM BIGGER OR OR LAST LONGER 
AND THEY WILL NOT BE BURDENED WITH NEW SAFETY STANDARDS 
THE FIRST GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TOMATO MAY BE ON YOUR SHELF NEXT SPRING 
OUR FIRST REPORT IS FROM BETTINA GREGORY 
TODAY MOST TOMATOES ARE PICKED GREEN GAS IS USED TO TURN THEM RED BUT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY RIPE WHEN THEY GET TO MARKET 
NEXT YEAR TOMATOES LIKE THESE WILL BE ON THE AND SHIPPED TO MARKET WHEN THEY ARE READY TO EAT 
THIS SO CALLED SUPER TOMATO STAYS RIPE LONGER BECAUSE ITS GENES HAVE BEEN ALTERED TO SLOW DOWN 
THE PEOPLE WHO WILL MARKET THESE TOMATOES AND THE GOVERNMENT SAY THE GENETICALLY ALTERED TOMATOES ARE PERFECTLY SAFE 
WHAT THE F. D. A. HAS DONE TODAY IS TELL YOU THAT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT THESE TOMATOES ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TOMATOES THAT THEY JUST TASTE BETTER 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS MOST GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CAN BE MARKETED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SAFETY TESTS OR ANY SORT OF PRE MARKET APPROVAL FROM THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION 
WE WILL ENSURE THAT BIOTECH PRODUCTS WILL RECEIVE THE SAME OVERSIGHT AS OTHER PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF BEING HAMPERED BY UNNECESSARY REGULATION 
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS NEED NO ADDITIONAL REGULATION IF THEY ARE MADE ENTIRELY OF SUBSTANCES PEOPLE ALREADY EAT SAFELY 
FOR EXAMPLE A BANANA GENE CAN BE INSERTED INTO A TOMATO 
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS ANY SYNTHETIC GENE LIKE A OR ANY GENE WHICH COULD PRODUCE AN ALLERGIC REACTION OR BE TOXIC WOULD REQUIRE THE F. D. A.'S APPROVAL 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE JEREMY RIFKIN SAYS THE NEW REGULATIONS WILL NOT PROTECT THE PUBLIC 
AND EACH TIME YOU MAKE ONE OF THESE CHANGES IT'S ECOLOGICAL 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A MUTATION THAT MAY OCCUR TO CAUSE ILLNESS OR PERHAPS DEATH 
THE ONLY WAY A CONSUMER WILL KNOW WHETHER HE OR SHE IS BUYING A GENETICALLY ALTERED PRODUCT IS IF ITS MAKERS VOLUNTARILY LABEL IT 
THE F. D. A. IS SO CONVINCED THE PROCESS IS SAFE IT WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY SPECIAL LABELING 
BETTINA GREGORY A. B. C. NEWS WASHINGTON 
WELL THINK BACK ON IT 
FOR YEARS FARMERS AND AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS HAVE CROSS BRED VARIOUS SPECIES TO MAKE THEM OR WHETHER IT'S TOMATOES OR POTATOES CORN OR 
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING NOW IS THEY CAN DO THE SAME BY GENETIC ENGINEERING ONLY A GOOD DEAL FASTER 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S BOB JAMIESON 
TODAY'S DECISION IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN THE LABORATORIES WHERE SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED FIVE DOZEN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS SOME ALMOST READY FOR MARKET 
AS AN EXAMPLE HAS NOT ONLY DEVELOPED ITS SUPER TOMATO BUT NEARBY GREENHOUSES ARE GROWING GENETICALLY DESIGNED PLANTS 
THEIR SEED PRODUCE COOKING OIL THAT IS MORE WITHOUT SATURATED FAT 
HAS ALSO ENGINEERED COTTON SEED WITH ITS OWN PESTICIDE 
WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND INTRODUCED A GENE INTO THE PLANT THAT PRODUCES A PROTEIN WHICH WHEN COTTON PESTS THE TISSUE AS THEY FEED THEY TAKE IN THE PROTEIN AND THEY DIE 
IF BIOTECHNOLOGY LIVES UP TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL IN AGRICULTURE FARMERS COULD ULTIMATELY CUT THEIR CHEMICAL USE AND PLANT SEEDS RESISTANT TO DISEASE THAT CAN GROW WITH LESS WATER 
THAT COULD INCREASE YIELDS AND LOWER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS 
THE FARM INDUSTRY WELCOMED TODAY'S ADMINISTRATION RULING 
THESE NEW RULES WILL HELP TO OPEN THE PROSPECTS TO THESE NEW MORE FOODS 
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALMOST UNLIMITED AS FAR AS THE FUTURE IS CONCERNED 
ANALYSTS SAY BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE TODAY IS ABOUT WHERE BIOTECHNOLOGY IN THE HEALTH INDUSTRY WAS A DECADE AGO WHEN THE FIRST GENETICALLY ENGINEERED DRUG WAS INTRODUCED 
SINCE THEN BIOTECH DRUGS HAVE BECOME A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY 
BUT ANALYSTS ARE CAUTIOUS ABOUT SUCH AN EXPLOSION IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY 
ANALYSTS SAY THE FUTURE OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD DEPENDS LESS ON REGULATION THAN IT DOES ON PRODUCING SOMETHING CONSUMERS LIKE 
BOB JAMIESON A. B. C. NEWS NEW YORK 
IN A MOMENT WE'LL HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER NEWS A SUPREME COURT DECISION TODAY MEANS CONSUMERS MAY SOON PAY SALES TAX ON SOME OF THEIR MAIL ORDER PURCHASES ON THE AMERICAN AGENDA TODAY AN ALTERNATIVE TO PUTTING DRUNK DRIVERS IN JAIL AND FINALLY AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST WHO HAS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE 
THERE'S A DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT TODAY THAT MAY MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO ORDER FROM SOME MAIL ORDER CATALOGUES 
MAIL ORDER IS A TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY BUT MOST OF US WHO ORDER FROM THEM DO NOT HAVE TO PAY SALES TAX IF THE MAIL ORDER COMPANY IS OUT OF STATE 
THAT MAY CHANGE 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S TIM O'BRIEN 
THE CORPORATION IS A NATIONAL MAIL ORDER FIRM WHICH SELLS OFFICE SUPPLIES AND IS BASED IN ILLINOIS 
THE COMPANY SELLS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PRODUCTS A YEAR ONE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH IN NORTH DAKOTA WHERE CUSTOMERS WHO BUY THROUGH THE MAIL DO NOT PAY SALES TAXES 
THE STATE TRIED TO IMPOSE A TAX ON TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOST REVENUE AND THE COMPANY CHALLENGED THE TAX IN COURT 
TODAY THE SUPREME COURT RULED THERE'S NOTHING UNCONSTITUTIONAL ABOUT STATES TAXING MAIL ORDER FIRMS EVEN THOUGH THOSE FIRMS ARE LOCATED ELSEWHERE WITH NO PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE 
JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEVENS SAID IT WAS ENOUGH THAT DIRECTS ITS BUSINESS AT NORTH DAKOTA AND DERIVES PROFITS FROM DOING BUSINESS THERE 
THE RULING COULD CUT INTO THE COMPETITIVE EDGE THAT MAIL ORDER COMPANIES NOW ENJOY THAT MAY HAVE TO PAY BILLIONS IN TAXES WHICH THEY WOULD SURELY PASS ON TO CUSTOMERS 
THE COURT DID SAY BECAUSE SUCH TAXES COULD BURDEN INTERSTATE COMMERCE CONGRESS MUST APPROVE THEM FIRST 
SOME LAWMAKERS ARE READY TO DO THAT SAYING IT IS ONLY FAIR TO OTHER BUSINESSES THAT PAY TAXES 
BUT THE CATALOGUE INDUSTRY PROMISES A FIGHT 
WE DON'T THINK THAT THE IMPOSITION OF SALES TAX IS GOOD FOR OUR INDUSTRY OR FOR THE CONSUMERS AND BY VIRTUE WE WILL LOBBY AGAINST IT STRONGLY 
BUT SOME INDUSTRY LEADERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TODAY'S RULING MAY FORCE DIRECT MARKETING FIRMS TO NEGOTIATE WITH LAWMAKERS SO THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN YOU BUY THROUGH THE MAIL YOU'LL PAY MORE SO THAT YOUR STATE MAY GET A PIECE OF THE ACTION 
TIM O'BRIEN A. B. C. NEWS WASHINGTON 
IN WASHINGTON TODAY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE HAS TRIED TO ADD A NOTE OF REALISM TO AN IMPORTANT DEBATE THAT IS UNDERWAY 
THE DEBATE IS ABOUT A PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET 
UNTIL NOW ITS CONGRESSIONAL SPONSORS HAVEN'T OFFERED ANY SPECIFICS OF JUST HOW THE BUDGET WOULD BE BALANCED 
TODAY'S REPORT IS VERY SPECIFIC 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S COKIE ROBERTS 
THE GLOOMY WEATHER OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL REFLECTED THE TONE OF THE REPORT ON WHAT IT WOULD REALLY TAKE TO GET THE DEFICIT TO ZERO IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
I'M NOT TRYING TO SCARE ANYBODY BUT I'M ALSO NOT TRYING TO KID ANYBODY 
OPPONENTS OF THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT CLAIM THAT CANCELING FUNDING FOR THE SPACE STATION THE SUPER CONDUCTING SUPER COLLIDER MASS TRANSIT AND THE ARTS WOULD ONLY MAKE A SMALL DENT IN THE DEFICIT 
OTHER SPENDING CUTS WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY HEALTH RESEARCH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOUSING 
AS AN ALTERNATIVE THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT TAXES COULD BE RAISED AND TAX BREAKS ELIMINATED A NATIONAL SALES TAX FOR EXAMPLE OR GASOLINE TAX OR THE ELIMINATION OF TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR HOME MORTGAGES 
SUPPORTERS OF THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT CLAIM THAT THE REPORT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SCARE TACTIC DESIGNED TO DRIVE AWAY VOTES FROM THE POLITICALLY POPULAR MEASURE 
TO THOSE WHO ASSERT DEFICIT REDUCTION WILL WREAK HAVOC ON THE ECONOMY AND DEFINITELY POSTPONE FOR AT LEAST A DECADE ANY ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THIS COUNTRY I HAVE TO ASK WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DEFICIT IS DOING TO OUR ECONOMY TODAY 
OVER THE YEARS CONGRESS HAS PASSED LAWS AND SIGNED AGREEMENTS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET BUT THE DEFICIT KEEPS GROWING 
NOW CONGRESS SEEMS READY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
POLITICIANS FIND IT EASIER TO OUTLAW THE RED INK THAN TO RAISE TAXES AND MAKE SPENDING CUTS NECESSARY TO ERASE IT 
COKIE ROBERTS A. B. C. NEWS CAPITOL HILL 
THE HOUSING INDUSTRY WHICH HAD BEEN VERY STRONG EARLY THIS YEAR IS A LITTLE WEAKER 
SALES OF EXISTING HOMES WERE DOWN THREE TENTHS OF A PERCENT IN APRIL 
THAT'S THE FIRST DECLINE IN THREE MONTHS 
ON WALL STREET THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS LOST TWENTY TWO AND ONE HALF POINTS TO CLOSE AT THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR AND THE TRADING WAS HEAVY 
WE'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT 
IN OTHER NEWS TODAY THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES HAS DECIDED TO QUIT HIS JOB AND CONCENTRATE ON ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION 
THE PRESIDENT OF YALE UNIVERSITY SCHMIDT SAID TODAY HE IS RESIGNING TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
WE ASKED BILL BLAKEMORE WHO REPORTS ON EDUCATION FOR THE AMERICAN AGENDA TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEW PROJECT 
ALL RIGHT 
THE BLAKEMORE PIECE IS NOT QUITE READY YET SO WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN A SECOND 
LET'S GO ON ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU FIRST ABOUT HAITI 
RIGHT 
ALL RIGHT 
STAND BY FOR A SECOND 
IT'S A STORY ABOUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND ITS NEW POLICY ON HAITI 
THE COAST GUARD PICKED UP THIRTY EIGHT HAITIANS TODAY TRYING TO LEAVE HAITI IN SMALL BOATS AND TOOK THEM BACK AGAIN 
IT IS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S NEW POLICY OF FORCING HAITIANS BACK BEFORE GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE A CASE FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM 
IF THE PAST IS AN INDICATION HAITIANS WILL HOWEVER STILL TRY TO ESCAPE 
AND A. B. C.'S LINDA PATTILLO IS IN MIAMI 
THE FIRST TIME FLED HAITI WAS LAST NOVEMBER 
HE WAS PICKED UP BY THE U. S. COAST GUARD AND TAKEN BACK 
THIS PHOTOGRAPH PUBLISHED AROUND THE WORLD WAS TAKEN AS WAS HELPED OFF THE DOCK IN HAITI WITH A BROKEN FOOT 
AN HOUR LATER HE WAS ARRESTED BY THE HAITIAN POLICE 
THEY STRUCK ME FIFTEEN TIMES WITH A STICK HE SAYS 
THEY TOLD ME THE REASON THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KILL ME IS SO I CAN GO BACK TO WHERE I'M FROM AS AN EXAMPLE SO THAT OTHERS DON'T TAKE THE BOATS 
THEY SAID THAT THE NEXT TIME WE FIND YOU ON A BOAT YOU WILL BE KILLED INSTANTLY 
DESPITE THAT FLED IN ANOTHER BOAT IN DECEMBER 
HE WAS PICKED UP AGAIN BUT THIS TIME WITHOUT EXPLAINING WHY THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE ALLOWED HIM INTO THE U. S. TO TRY TO APPLY FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM 
OTHER HAITIANS WHO HAVE FLED BEEN FORCED BACK AND FLED AGAIN TELL SIMILAR STORIES 
THEIR ACCOUNTS OF PERSECUTION ARE AT ODDS WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S DEFENSE OF ITS NEW REFUGEE POLICY 
OUR EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE CONTACTED OVER TWO THOUSAND REPATRIATED HAITIANS IN THE CAPITAL AND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
IN NO CASE HAVE THEY FOUND EVIDENCE OF MISTREATMENT CONNECTED TO THEIR REPATRIATION 
THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG 
IT CAN'T BE IGNORED 
THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH TESTIMONY THAT THIS IS HAPPENING 
WE HAVE LIVING BREATHING WITNESSES TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN HAITI TO THOSE WHO ARE FORCIBLY RETURNED 
EVEN HAITIANS LIKE WHO GET TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM HAVE ONLY A ONE IN TEN CHANCE OF CONVINCING U. S. AUTHORITIES THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE FEAR OF PERSECUTION 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU ARE FORCED TO GO BACK TO HAITI 
IF I'M FORCED BACK TO HAITI HE SAYS WHERE I LAND I WILL DIE 
LINDA PATTILLO A. B. C. NEWS MIAMI 
OVERSEAS FOR A MOMENT 
RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN TOURING SIBERIA TODAY SAID HE IS NOT PLANNING TO RUN FOR RE ELECTION WHEN HIS TERM IS UP ON NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
HE ALSO SAID THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH OPPOSITION HE FACES HE WILL NOT QUIT EARLY 
RUSSIA AND UKRAINE HAVE FINALLY DECIDED THEY WILL NEGOTIATE CONTROL OF THE OLD SOVIET NAVY'S BLACK SEA FLEET 
THEY'LL TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIVIDE THE FLEET BETWEEN THEM 
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER ISRAELI RAID ON LEBANON TODAY 
IT IS THE FIFTH IN SIX DAYS 
ISRAEL SAYS THE TARGET WAS A MILITARY TRAINING CAMP FOR THE FUNDAMENTALIST HIZBOLLAH MOVEMENT 
THREE OF THE GROUPS MEMBERS WERE REPORTEDLY WOUNDED 
THE FORMER AMERICAN DIPLOMAT PHILIP HAS DIED 
IT WAS MR. ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT CARTER WHO SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT EGYPT'S PRESIDENT ANWAR SADAT AND ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER MENACHEM BEGIN TOGETHER TO BEGIN MAKING PEACE 
WAS SEVENTY TWO 
NOW LET'S RETURN TO EDUCATION 
AS WE SAID TODAY THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING UNIVERSITIES HAS DECIDED TO QUIT HIS JOB AND CONCENTRATE ON ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION 
HE IS SCHMIDT 
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF YALE 
HE'S GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EFFORT TO TRY AND CREATE A NATIONAL NETWORK OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
BILL BLAKEMORE AS WE SAID COVERS THE AMERICAN AGENDA EDUCATION BEAT FOR US SO HE TAKES A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO 
THE FIRST THING SCHMIDT WILL HAVE TO DO FOR WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS IS WHAT HE DID FOR YALE RAISE MONEY 
THEY'LL NEED TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FAST TO GET FIRST TWO HUNDRED PRIVATE SCHOOLS UP AND RUNNING BY NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
THE PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION THAT WE'RE FACING IN THIS COUNTRY ARE CERTAINLY NOT AT YALE 
THEY'RE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AS IT'S NOW CONCEIVED AND HIGH SCHOOLS 
AND I THINK WE NEED A NEW VISION OF WHAT THAT EDUCATION IS ABOUT 
THE PLAN IS EVENTUALLY TO CREATE ONE THOUSAND PROFIT MAKING SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
THEY SAY THEY'LL ACCEPT ALL APPLICANTS 
THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT WILL PAY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TUITION THE AVERAGE COST PUBLIC SCHOOLS SPEND PER CHILD 
AND THEY SAY TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR STUDENTS WILL BE GIVEN SCHOLARSHIPS 
WHITTLE SAYS HE'LL CUT DOWN ON COSTS BY REDUCING ADMINISTRATION AND ASKING NOT ONLY PARENTS TO DO SOME OF THE TEACHING BUT ALSO KIDS 
IT'S A GREAT COURSE FOR THE KIDS THAT ARE DOING THE TEACHING 
SO IT'S NOT ONLY GOOD ECONOMICS IT'S ALSO GOOD EDUCATION 
BUT SOME EDUCATORS SAY PROFIT MAKING SCHOOLS ARE NOT GOOD FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION 
INSTEAD OF PROVIDING SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO GET PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO LIVE UP TO THE PROMISE AND NECESSITY OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE'RE AT THIS MOMENT CONSIDERING ABANDONING THEM ALTOGETHER 
SCHMIDT AND WHITTLE SAY THEIR NEW SCHOOLS WILL BE REVOLUTIONARY 
SKEPTICS POINT OUT IT MAY ALL SOUND GOOD BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO RAISE 
AND FOR ALL THE PRESTIGE BROUGHT BY THE PRESIDENT OF YALE UNIVERSITY PRODUCING ANY GOOD NATIONWIDE SYSTEM OF SCHOOLS HAS SO FAR PROVEN FAR FROM ELEMENTARY 
BILL BLAKEMORE A. B. C. NEWS NEW YORK

AMERICAN AGENDA 
WE HAVE PUT ON THE AMERICAN AGENDA TONIGHT DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED 
OF THE MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS MORE THAN HALF INVOLVE DRUNK DRIVERS 
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONVICTED OF DRUNK DRIVING AT LEAST ONCE 
HOW TO GET THEM OFF THE ROAD BEFORE THEY KILL 
OUR AGENDA REPORTER IS WALTER RODGERS 
C. A NINE ONE THREE ONE OH OH STATE VERSUS ROBERT 
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THIS COURT APPEARANCE ROBERT JOHN A FIFTY FOUR YEAR OLD CONSTRUCTION WORKER WAS CAUGHT DRIVING WITH A BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL THREE TIMES THE LEGAL LIMIT 
SAM YOUR CLIENT IS CHARGED WITH DRUNK DRIVING 
THIS WILL BE SECOND CONVICTION FOR DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED 
HE MUST NOW ENTER A STATE PROGRAM FOR TREATING DRUNK DRIVERS 
IF I WERE YOU I'D MAKE THIS YOUR LAST ADVENTURE IN BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO COME BACK HERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE STATE PENAL SYSTEM 
AND AT YOUR AGE THAT MEANS THE STATE PENITENTIARY 
JAILING DRUNK DRIVERS USED TO BE THE ONLY OPTION JUDGES HAD 
BUT IN PRINCE COUNTY MARYLAND JUST OUTSIDE WASHINGTON THEY HAVE COMBINED A JAIL SENTENCE WITH AN INTENSIVE ALCOHOL TREATMENT PROGRAM 
AND NINETY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM NEVER COME BACK 
BY GOD IT'S THE MOST INTELLIGENT STEP I'VE SEEN TAKEN IN THIRTY YEARS IN THE BUSINESS AND TWENTY YEARS AS A JUDGE 
FOR ANYONE CONVICTED OF THE PROGRAM STARTS WITH A WEEK IN JAIL IN THE COUNTY DETENTION CENTER 
AND LIKE MOST OTHERS STARTED OUT 
IF ALCOHOLISM IS A DISEASE I DON'T SEE WHAT PUTTING A GUY IN JAIL DOES FOR HIM 
THE CARROT AND THE STICK IS THE RIGHT APPROACH 
YOU LET FOLKS KNOW JUST HOW FAR IT CAN BE BAD AND THEN GIVE HIM THE OPTION OF WHAT LEVEL OF GOOD THEY WANT TO FIND THEMSELVES ON 
THE JAIL PHASE OF THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO GET THE DRUNK DRIVER'S ATTENTION 
THERE IS A LOT OF EXPOSURE TO MEN WHO HAVE DONE MORE THAN DRINK AND DRIVE 
I THINK THAT THOSE RAZOR SHARP WIRES THAT SPARTAN BED ALL OF THE COMPONENTS REALLY MAKE ONE CONFRONT THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF THIS DISEASE I AM NOW IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT 
AFTER A WEEK IN JAIL 
SUNLIGHT 
IS TRANSFERRED TO THE FACILITY 
PHASE TWO OF THIS PROGRAM OFFERS INTENSIVE COUNSELING THERAPY AND HOPE 
THE PEOPLE HERE IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO 
THEY HAVE THE HEART TO HELP YOU 
IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR HEART AND BE RECEPTIVE THEY CAN HELP YOU OUT 
THIS FACILITY HOUSES SIXTY INMATES WHO FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL LEARN FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR ADDICTIONS 
EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE PASS THROUGH THIS FACILITY EVERY YEAR AT VERY LITTLE EXPENSE TO THE TAXPAYERS 
RESIDENTS HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN CARE AND COUNSELING USUALLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
FOR THAT THEY GET TO CONFRONT THE PROBLEM MOST HAVE DENIED 
WHEN YOU SAY DENIAL I'VE NEVER BOTHERED TO TRY DENYING 
IS THERE A PROBLEM JOHN 
WITH WHAT 
DRINKING 
YES THERE IS 
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE HERE 
THE THERAPY TAKES PLACE AT NIGHTS AND ON WEEKENDS 
DURING THE DAY RESIDENTS RETURN TO THEIR USUAL JOBS 
JOHN WORKS CRUSHING CONCRETE 
AT NIGHT HIS PROGRESS IS MONITORED BY THE COUNSELING STAFF 
SOMEONE LIKE JOHN WHO HAS BEEN IN THIS PROGRAM FOR A WEEK NOW SIX DAYS WHAT DO YOU HOPE THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED AT THIS POINT 
AT THIS POINT IF HE HAS ALCOHOLISM AND HE CONTINUES USING THE DRUG THAT IT'S GOING TO KILL HIM AND MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE 
IT IS THE IMPACT OF WARD'S STORY THAT TOUCHES GROUP THE MOST IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THERAPY 
WARD VOLUNTEERS TO TELL HIS STORY OF BEING HIT BY A DRUNK DRIVER ELEVEN YEARS AGO 
HE DID MORE THAN BREAK MY LEGS IN SIXTY SEVEN PLACES 
HE DID MORE THAN TO PUSH ME TO THE BRINK OF TRYING TO KILL MYSELF TWICE 
AND HE TURNED MY LIFE INSIDE OUT 
AND FOR WHAT 
I WOULD RECOMMEND A COUPLE OF DOUBLE A. MEETINGS A WEEK 
AT A FINAL COUNSELING SESSION AGREED TO ATTEND ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETINGS MAINTAINING HIS SOBRIETY 
YOU WON'T CATCH ME ON THE ROAD AFTER SOME BEERS 
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT

A. B. C.'S DICK SCHAAP REPORTS TONIGHT ON THE CHALLENGE FOR ONE OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST 
IN THE LOS ANGELES OLYMPICS EIGHT YEARS AGO BRUCE HAYES OF THE UNITED STATES THE WORLD'S BEST SWIMMER MIKHAIL GROSS OF WEST GERMANY ON THE FINAL LEG OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED METER RELAY AND WON A GOLD MEDAL 
JOY WAS OBVIOUS 
HIS AGONY WAS NOT 
BRUCE HAYES WAS A GOLD MEDALIST AND PRIVATELY GAY 
I HEARD THE JOKES EVERY DAY AND I HEARD THE GAY BASHING THAT WENT ON AND I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO CONFIDE IN SOMEBODY THAT I'M GAY 
HAYES WAS NOT THE ONLY GAY OLYMPIAN 
IF YOU WENT BACK AND LOOKED THROUGH THE OLYMPIC RECORD BOOKS IF EVERYONE WERE TO COME OUT I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE IMPRESSED 
BUT VERY FEW OF THE CAME OUT 
THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU TO BEGIN WITH THAT THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS AN ADDED KIND OF PRESSURE 
HAYES KEPT HIS HOMOSEXUALITY PRIVATE 
HE GAVE UP SWIMMING WENT TO WORK AT A PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM IN NEW YORK 
THEN A BOYHOOD FRIEND RICK REYNOLDS WHO HAD HEARD HAYES WAS GAY CONVINCED HIM TO JOIN NEW YORK A GAY SWIMMING TEAM 
JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT HE IS AND WHERE HE'S BEEN AND WHAT HE HAS DONE AND TO SEE HIM SWIMMING ALONGSIDE OF US IS IT'S JUST NOTHING SHORT OF INSPIRATIONAL 
TWO YEARS AGO AT THE GAY GAMES IN VANCOUVER HAYES SWAM BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT 
HE WON SEVEN GOLD MEDALS 
SUDDENLY HE WAS OUT OPENLY GAY 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER A DAY WHEN I WOKE UP AND SAID I'M COMING OUT NOW 
IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS 
IT'S AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SCARY PROCESS TO COME OUT 
BRUCE IS NOW COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO BE ACTIVELY PROMOTING GAY GAMES THE FOURTH WHICH WILL BE HELD IN NEW YORK CITY IN TWO YEARS 
SOMEBODY THAT I CAME OUT TO ONCE SAID OH YOU CAN'T BE GAY 
YOU WON A GOLD MEDAL 
AND THAT IT JUST ENRAGED ME BECAUSE THAT'S THE SORT OF STEREOTYPE THAT I THINK GAYS AND LESBIANS ARE FIGHTING AGAINST 
HAYES USED TO BE AFRAID OF FIGHTING THE STEREOTYPE
