MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WERE GLUED TO THEIR TELEVISION SCREENS THIS WEEK WATCHING THE ASTRONAUTS FIX THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE 
POPULAR CULTURE COMMENTATOR STEVEN STARK WAS ONE OF THEM 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE 
BUT OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SPACE AGAIN 
WHAT PRECIPITATED THIS OF COURSE WAS THE MISSION TO REPAIR THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE WHICH SEEMED TO DOMINATE THE NEWS AND WATER COOLER TALK MORE THAN ANY OTHER SPACE MISSION SINCE THE CHALLENGER DISASTER ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AGO 
PART OF THE INCREASED ATTENTION MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS SIMPLY HAS BEEN A SLOW MONTH WITH CONGRESS OUT OF SESSION AND NO FOREIGN POLICY TO DOMINATE THE NEWS 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY THE NATION'S GAZE HAS TURNED UP TO THE STARS 
OR AT LEAST THE STARS VIA THE SMALL SCREEN YET AGAIN 
IN THE WAKE OF THE CHALLENGER TRAGEDY PEOPLE SEEMED TO FORGET WHAT GOOD TELEVISION SPACE HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
IT WAS AFTER ALL THE FIRST GREAT T. V. MINISERIES AN EIGHT YEAR TO THE MOON HOSTED BY WALTER CRONKITE 
ALWAYS CAREFULLY SCRIPTED WITH BETTER AND BETTER PICTURES 
IT BEGAN OF COURSE WITH ALAN SHEPHERD'S FIFTEEN MINUTES IN SPACE TOOK US THROUGH JOHN SCOTT MISSING CAPSULE THE SPACE WALKS THE CHRISTMAS MISSION THAT THE MOON AND FINALLY NEIL WALK ITSELF 
IN THAT SENSE INTEREST IN THE HUBBLE MISSION IS YET ANOTHER FORM OF NOSTALGIA A REMINDER OF THE DAYS IN THE SIXTIES WHEN AMERICA'S SELF CONFIDENCE STILL KNEW NO BOUNDS AND WE ALL TOLD OURSELVES WE HAD THAT CAN DO NASA SPIRIT 
IN THE SIXTIES WE CAME TO TAKE SPACE SUCCESS VIRTUALLY FOR GRANTED BUT THE FACT THAT THIS MISSION WENT WELL THIRTY YEARS LATER SEEMS ALMOST SURPRISING AND THEREFORE POIGNANT 
IN AN ERA WHEN THERE IS NO MONEY OR WILL FOR SPACE TRAVEL OR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE THIS WAS THE SOCIAL EQUIVALENT OF AN OLD GAME OR A REUNION CONCERT 
THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT SPACE HAS RETURNED IN THIS SEASON 
WE HAVE AFTER ALL JUST SEEN OF OTHER SIXTIES HITS BONANZA THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES AND THE FAMILY AS WELL AS THE USUAL ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS OF J. F. K. 
IF THOSE SIXTIES ICONS CAN COME BACK FOR A NIGHT OR TWO WHY NOT SPACE 
WHAT'S MORE I TALKED IN MY LAST COMMENTARY ABOUT THE RETURN OF THE WESTERN AND HOW THAT GENRE TENDS TO REAPPEAR IN ERAS WHEN THE PROMISE OF THE FRONTIER HAS DISAPPEARED AND THE FOR THAT LOST PAST INCREASES 
SO IT GOES TOO WITH WHAT STAR TREK ONCE CALLED THE LAST FRONTIER AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY MADE THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS NEW FRONTIER 
WE FOUND OUT THIS WEEK THAT WE MISSED THE ROMANCE OF SPACE MORE THAN WE THOUGHT 
BEAM US ABOARD SCOTTY
