ANTHONY DIED YESTERDAY AT AGE NINETY TWO 
PERHAPS THE NAME DOESN'T RING A BELL BUT MR. BORN IN SICILY WORKED THERE AS A TROLLEY CAR CONDUCTOR SERVED IN THE ITALIAN INFANTRY IN WORLD WAR ONE SAILED TO AMERICA IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE FOUND WORK AS A HELPER SAVED UP BOUGHT A TAXI CAB THEN A GROCERY ON LONG ISLAND 
AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST ANOTHER IMMIGRANT SUCCESS STORY WENT BIG TIME AFTER ANTHONY MOVED TO FLORIDA IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES 
HE BOUGHT THE CAFETERIA IN AND DEVELOPED A SPECTACULARLY LUCRATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH ORANGES 
KEN IS A FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY THAT MR. FOUNDED 
MR. PERHAPS YOU CAN BEGIN BY TELLING US WHAT WAS IT ABOUT ORANGE JUICE AND ORANGES THAT ANTHONY DID THAT OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T DO 
WELL I THINK YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMING 
AT THE TIME HE GOT INTO TO THE BUSINESS ORANGE JUICE WAS THEN PRIMARILY MADE FROM CONCENTRATE 
AND HE FELT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER PRODUCT THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED 
AND SO HE KEPT WORKING ON EQUIPMENT THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME TO DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE JUST SUPERIOR TO CONCENTRATE OR CONCENTRATE WHICH YOU MIGHT BUY IN A FROZEN SECTION OF YOUR GROCERY STORE 
AND WHEN HE COULDN'T FIND EQUIPMENT HE IN FACT DESIGNED IT AND BUILT IT 
CRITICAL TO HIS SUCCESS I GATHER WAS THE USE OF THE REFRIGERATED TRUCK 
PRIMARILY BECAUSE AT THAT TIME REFRIGERATION IN THE STORES WAS LIMITED AND DISTRIBUTION IN REFRIGERATED FOOD WAS ALMOST UNKNOWN 
AND SO HE AT THAT TIME SAT DOWN WITH VERY LITTLE FUNDS AND BOUGHT I THINK ONE HUNDRED FIFTY REFRIGERATED TRUCKS FROM THE WHITE MOTOR COMPANY 
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES WAS THE IDEA OF WAS THAT CHALLENGING THE MORE POPULAR CONCENTRATE THAT WAS ALREADY ON THE MARKET 
YES IT WAS A COMPETITIVE BATTLE TO CONVINCE THE INDUSTRY THAT THE PRODUCT WAS PRACTICAL AND THEN TO CONVINCE THE CONSUMER THAT THE PRODUCT WAS BETTER 
IS THE ORANGE JUICE THAT PEOPLE BUY ON THE SHELVES NOW THE COMPANY HAS GONE THROUGH A COUPLE OF CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP SINCE OBVIOUSLY BUT IS IT THE SAME BREW OF ORANGE JUICE THAT MR. USED TO TEST EVERY MORNING I GATHER DURING HIS DAYS AT 
OH I THINK SO 
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT AND PROBABLY SOMEWHAT A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED DUE TO TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS OCCURRED SINCE HE SOLD THE COMPANY 
I'VE READ THAT IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN HE DEVELOPED A HUGE CONTRACT WITH THE WALDORF ASTORIA 
THAT WAS FRUIT SALAD SEGMENTS 
THIS WAS A BUSINESS THAT HE LITERALLY PUT TOGETHER 
HE AT FIRST HAD A FRESH FRUIT COMPANY 
AND IN SHIPPING THE FRESH FRUIT HE HAD TO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO THAT OUT TO GRADE IT OUT AND HE HAD A LOT OF FRUIT THAT WAS NOT BUT WAS STILL GOOD FRUIT 
AND HE WAS NOT ONE TO WASTE THINGS 
AND SO HE STARTED THAT FRUIT AND PUTTING IT INTO GALLON JARS 
AND HE ULTIMATELY BUILT QUITE A MARKET WITH THE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT TRADE STARTING IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE TRADE 
AND IT BECAME AN INDUSTRY ALL OF ITS OWN 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHEN HE DID THAT HE WAS MAKING USE OF FRUIT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN LOOKED GOOD ENOUGH TO SHIP WHOLE UP TO NEW YORK 
IS THAT IT 
THAT IS CORRECT 
IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULDN'T MEET THE FRESH FRUIT GRADE BUT WAS ALTOGETHER GOOD FRUIT 
SO HE SIMPLY TOOK THE PEEL OFF AND CUT THE SECTIONS OUT AND PUT IT INTO JARS AND CAPPED IT UNDER VACUUM AND SHIPPED IT UP THERE 
SO THIS WAS A MAN WHO WHEN HE LOOKED AT FRUIT IN A BUSINESS PROPOSITION HE REALLY SAW THE POTENTIAL WHAT WAS INSIDE THE FRUIT WHAT YOU COULD MAKE FROM THE ORANGE OR THE GRAPEFRUIT APART FROM SIMPLY SELLING IT AS AN ORANGE OR A GRAPEFRUIT 
I THINK THAT'S CORRECT 
I THINK HE LOOKED AT PEOPLE THE SAME WAY 
HE LOOKED INSIDE 
AND HE SAW SOMETHING THERE A LOT OF TIMES OTHER PEOPLE WOULDN'T SEE 
KEN FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF SPEAKING TO US FROM FLORIDA ABOUT FOUNDER ANTHONY 
MR. WAS ALSO A PHILANTHROPIST 
AFTER SELLING HIS COMPANY TO BEATRICE FOODS FOR NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE DONATED MUCH OF THAT MONEY TO ESTABLISH TWO CHRISTIAN FOUNDATIONS
