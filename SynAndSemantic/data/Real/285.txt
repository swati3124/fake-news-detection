FINALLY TONIGHT YOUR MONEY YOUR CHOICE OUR WEEKLY LOOK AT HOW THE GOVERNMENT CHOOSES TO SPEND SOME OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS 
IT SEEMS UNLIKE OLD SOLDIERS MANY OLD GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS NEITHER DIE NOR FADE AWAY 
TONIGHT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM CONCEIVED NEARLY A CENTURY AGO THAT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING AT A COST OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S JOHN MARTIN 
NINETY YEARS AGO DURING THE SPANISH AMERICA WAR U. S. MILITARY LEADERS COMPLAINED THAT YOUNG RECRUITS WERE POOR SHOTS 
CONGRESS RODE TO THE RESCUE 
IT CREATED A PROGRAM TO TRAIN CIVILIANS TO SHOOT BETTER IN CASE THEY WERE CALLED TO SERVE 
THESE DAYS MILITARY RECRUITS LEARN TO SHOOT BETTER IN BASIC TRAINING 
BUT THE CIVILIAN PROGRAM IS STILL BEING FUNDED BY CONGRESS 
THE MONEY GOES TO THE ARMY 
IT DOLES OUT BULLETS TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PRIVATE GUN CLUBS FROM FIVE MILITARY DEPOTS 
THIS IS ONE LETTER CANNING ARMY DEPOT IN PENNSYLVANIA 
WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE BULLETS 
AFTER REPEATED REQUESTS TO VISIT ANY OF THE FIVE DEPOTS THE ARMY SAID NO 
IT SAID IT KNEW WE WOULD EXAGGERATE THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM 
WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE GUN CLUBS 
FOR WEEKS THE ARMY COULDN'T SEEM TO COME UP WITH THE NAMES OF THE CLUBS 
FINALLY IT SENT US THIS LIST WITHOUT ANY ADDRESSES 
IT REFUSES TO GIVE ANY 
TAKE THE SHOT AND THEN JUST WAIT 
WE TRACKED DOWN MARSHA BEASLEY WHO HELPS RUN THE PROGRAM 
SHE COACHES THE RIFLE TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST VIRGINIA 
UNDER THE PROGRAM THE ARMY GIVES THE SCHOOL FREE BULLETS NOT FOR THE TEAM BUT FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF LEARNING SAFETY LEARNING SELF DISCIPLINE DEVELOPING SELF ESTEEM LEARNING RESPONSIBILITY 
THE PENTAGON ADMITS THE PROGRAM HAS NO MILITARY VALUE 
THIS FALL SOME IN CONGRESS TRIED TO SHOOT IT DOWN 
THERE'S NOT A MEMBER OF THIS CONGRESS WHO COULD LOOK A CONSTITUENT IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM I'M GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES RESTRICT YOUR MEDICARE ELIMINATE YOUR PROGRAM BUT I'M FINDING THE MONEY TO GIVE FREE AMMUNITION TO YOUNG CHILDREN 
THIS IS A VITAL VITAL PROGRAM 
IT SPENDS PENNIES TO SAVE MILLIONS TO PROMOTE GOOD CHARACTER IN YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS WHEN THEY GROW UP 
CONGRESS FOLLOWED SOLOMON'S WISDOM 
IT SAVED THE PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER YEAR 
THE ARMY RUNS IT FROM THIS BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON WITH THIRTY CIVILIANS AND A COLONEL 
NO PICTURES HERE EITHER 
SO UNDER A VEIL OF VISUAL SECRECY WORTHY OF WARTIME THE ARMY IS ISSUING MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION ROUNDS OF FREE AMMUNITION IN YOUR NAME WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF YOUR MONEY
