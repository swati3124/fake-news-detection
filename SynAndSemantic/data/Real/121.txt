IN TONIGHT'S NEWS FROM MEDICINE WE FOCUS ON A STUDY WHOSE CONCLUSIONS MANY WILL FIND SHOCKING 
PERHAPS YOU THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE AIDS GIVEN THE DEADLY TOLL 
WELL THINK AGAIN 
RESEARCHERS SAY AIDS HAS LEFT SCARCELY A WRINKLE ON THE FABRIC OF AMERICAN SOCIETY 
C. N. N. MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT JEFF LEVINE REPORTS 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM AIDS IN THE LAST DECADE 
BUT A NEW REPORT FROM A PRESTIGIOUS ADVISORY GROUP SUGGESTS THE EPIDEMIC HAS NOT LEFT A PERMANENT MARK ON SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL LOOKED AT THE EFFECT OF AIDS ON PUBLIC HEALTH RELIGION PRISONS RESEARCH HEALTH SERVICES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 
ALTHOUGH IT'S A CATASTROPHIC EPIDEMIC IT HASN'T MADE MUCH CHANGE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WAY THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS 
THE REPORT TITLED THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF AIDS IN THE U. S. NOTES THAT OTHER EPIDEMICS LIKE THE BLACK PLAGUE LED TO LASTING SOCIAL CHANGE 
BUT THE OTHERS POINT OUT THAT AIDS IS NOT DEMOCRATIC AND THAT IT'S EFFECTS ARE MOST PROFOUND ON PEOPLE THEY CALL SOCIALLY INVISIBLE NAMELY GAYS AND DRUG ABUSERS 
SINCE IN ABSOLUTE TERMS THE NUMBERS OF THOSE WITH THE DISEASE IS RELATIVELY SMALL AIDS IS OFTEN VIEWED AS SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM 
THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST ASPECTS OF THE EPIDEMIC IT'S DISCRIMINATORY IN ITS MEANNESS 
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE AIDS HAS MADE A DENT ACCORDING TO THE REPORT'S AUTHORS AIDS ACTIVISTS HAVE SPEEDED UP THE DRUG APPROVAL PROCESS AS WELL AS THE PACE OF BASIC RESEARCH 
THERE'S THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A JOINT EFFORT 
THE PATERNALISM THAT EXISTED IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS IS NO LONGER ACCEPTED 
IF ANYTHING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC HAS THE ABILITY OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ABSORB A PROBLEM RATHER THAN RESPOND TO IT 
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS NO BETTER BECAUSE OF AIDS IN FACT IT'S PROBABLY A LOT WORSE AND SO MANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THEM BECOME VERY VERY CLEAR WITH AIDS 
THE REPORT'S AUTHORS COMPARE THE AIDS EPIDEMIC WITH ANOTHER TRAGEDY 
INFLUENZA CLAIMED SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY
