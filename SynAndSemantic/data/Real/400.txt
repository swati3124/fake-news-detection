THIS IS JIM HICKEY ON ISLAND NEAR PUERTO RICO 
WHILE THIS COMBINED NAVY MARINE TRAINING EXERCISE LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A REHEARSAL FOR THE INVASION OF HAITI MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE CAREFUL TO AVOID SUCH DESCRIPTIONS 
STILL THEY WANT THE HAITIAN GENERALS TO TAKE NOTICE 
I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE THAT WE'RE PREPARED THAT WE'RE WELL TRAINED AND WE'RE WELL EQUIPPED AND WE'RE READY TO DO WHATEVER IT IS WE HAVE TO DO 
THESE MARINES WERE THE LAST AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS TO LEAVE SOMALIA 
ON JULY FIRST HAVING JUST BEGUN THEIR FIRST HOME LEAVE IN SIX MONTHS THEY WERE ABRUPTLY RECALLED AND ORDERED TO STAND BY OFF THE COAST OF HAITI 
OSTENSIBLY THEY WERE NEEDED IN CASE AMERICANS HAD TO BE EVACUATED YET THEY CAN INVADE IF ORDERED TO DO SO 
OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT COMMENT ON FOREIGN OPERATIONS 
BUT YES WE'RE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT 
AND WE ARE READY TO DO IT 
ALTHOUGH MOST OF THESE MARINES HAVE SEEN ACTION AND ARE VETERANS OF SOMALIA IF THEY ARE ORDERED INTO HAITI THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS TIME THEY WILL BE THE FIRST ONES TO GO 
BUT WAITING AND WAITING FOR WHAT IT IS A POLITICAL DECISION IS TAKING ITS TOLL 
I'D SAY MORALE RIGHT NOW IS GETTING LOW BECAUSE WE'RE JUST OUT HERE SETTING UP AND NOT REALLY DOING ANYTHING 
AS TIME GOES ON WE'RE SITTING OUT HERE MORE AND MORE IT'S STARTING TO GET FRUSTRATING AGAIN THAT WE'RE NOT GOING HOME YET 
THAT'S WHY COMMANDERS SCHEDULED THIS TRAINING MISSION 
IT IS MORALE I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S NOT 
IT DOES HELP THE TROOPS 
IT BUILDS UP THEIR SPIRIT 
WITH THE TRAINING MISSION COMPLETED THIS WEEKEND HOWEVER IT IS BACK TO THE SHIPS AS MILITARY CONTINUES TO WAIT FOR POLITICIANS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT
