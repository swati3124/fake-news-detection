CONGRESS IS CONTINUING ITS PROBE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE MILITARY FOCUSING TODAY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
C. N. N.'S SKIP LOESCHER REPORTS A HOUSE PANEL HEARD FROM WOMEN WHO SAY THE DEPARTMENT DISCOURAGED EVEN IGNORED THEIR COMPLAINTS 
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS IS UNDER FIRE FOR ALLEGEDLY CONDONING THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF SOME OF ITS WOMEN EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM WORK IN V. A. MEDICAL CENTERS FROM COAST TO COAST 
MARY O'CONNOR CHARGES SHE WAS RETURNING FROM A BUSINESS MEETING WHEN A V. A. DOCTOR ACCOSTED HER 
PULLED THE GOVERNMENT CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD PROCEEDED TO PULL HIS PANTS DOWN AND FORCE MY HEAD INTO HIS CROTCH 
AND AFTER FILING A COMPLAINT O'CONNOR BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THOSE WHO HARASS WOMEN 
THEY ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS TRANSFERRED FROM OTHER FACILITIES 
THE V. A. HOSPITALS SHELTER NOT ONLY THOSE WOUNDED IN COMBAT BUT ADMINISTRATORS WHO CANNOT KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF FEMALE EMPLOYEES 
HAS COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION 
SHE TOO HAS FILED A COMPLAINT ALLEGING TO HAVE BEEN HARASSED BY A V. A. DOCTOR 
WHENEVER HE CAUGHT ME ALONE HE MADE CRUDE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT REMARKS QUESTIONED MY MORALITY AND MADE OFFENSIVE PROPOSITIONS 
OTHER WOMEN V. A. EMPLOYEES TELL SIMILAR STORIES OF HARASSMENT AND OF BEING MADE TO SUFFER BECAUSE THEY FILED COMPLAINTS 
IT BECAME APPARENT THAT MANAGEMENT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE VICTIMS THAN SOLVING THE PROBLEM 
THIS MYTH IS THAT SOMETHING WILL BE DONE TO PROTECT THE VICTIM 
THE V. A. ADMITS IT HAS A PROBLEM WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND CLAIMS IT'S WORKING TO ELIMINATE IT 
BUT IT ALSO CONTENDS THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW BAD APPLES AT V. A 
BUT I THINK IT IS TERRIBLY TERRIBLY UNFAIR TO CHARACTERIZE TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND HARD WORKING DEDICATED PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE OF THIS COUNTRY AS BEING ENGAGED IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
WHAT WE HAVE IS A SYSTEM WHICH IT'S SIMPLY NOT WORKING 
IT'S A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE VICTIMS DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR RIGHTS 
FOR EVANS THE BOTTOM LINE IS SIMPLE IF THERE IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT INSIDE THE V. A. HOW WELL CAN IT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO WOMEN VETERANS 
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE SEXUALLY ABUSED DURING THEIR MILITARY SERVICE
