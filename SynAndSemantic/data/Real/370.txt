LET'S GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE WE HAVE GWEN IFILL WHO WORKS FOR THERE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES 
WE'VE HAD THIS WEEK PRESIDENT'S COUNSEL TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY FOR THE PAULA JONES LAWSUIT 
WE HAD THE SPECIAL ELECTION LOSS 
WE ALSO HAD A FAMOUS GOLF TRIP ON AN ARMY HELICOPTER 
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BE HEADING FOR D. DAY CELEBRATIONS IN EUROPE GWEN 
MARINES TO YOU YOUNG MAN 
THAT WAS A MARINE HELICOPTER 
I'M SORRY 
NO IT WAS IN LOTS OF WAYS NOT A PARTICULARLY WONDERFUL WEEK 
WE'VE TOUCHED ON A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY 
THERE IS THE ROSTENKOWSKI CASE WHICH IS BAD NEWS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN MANY WAYS 
THERE IS HEALTH CARE STALLED AGAIN AS IT'S BEEN STALLED HALF A DOZEN TIMES BAD NEWS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
THERE'S THIS STUMBLE INVOLVING THE HELICOPTER IN WHICH ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S SENIOR AIDES DECIDED TO TAKE A MARINE HELICOPTER THAT THE PRESIDENT USUALLY RIDES ON TO GO FOR A GOLFING TRIP IN WESTERN MARYLAND 
HE GOT FIRED THE NEXT DAY 
NOW GWEN MAKE SOME NEWS HERE 
WEREN'T THERE TWO HELICOPTER RIDES ACTUALLY THAT WERE GOING TO PICK UP 
WELL THERE WERE ACTUALLY TWO 
THERE WAS A FOLLOW UP HELICOPTER AS WELL 
AND DAVID WATKINS THE AIDE WHO WAS FIRED AND SEVERAL OTHER WHITE HOUSE AIDES ARE GOING TO ALL CHIP IN IN THIS VERY COMMUNAL WAY AND HELP TO REPAY THE COST OF THOSE OPERATING HELICOPTERS 
IT'S A PRETTY BIG MESS 
THERE ALSO WAS THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED FINALLY HIS LONG AWAITED DECISION ON WHETHER TO GRANT TRADE STATUS FAVORED TRADE STATUS TO CHINA 
AND WHEN HE DID IT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO EXTEND THESE TRADE PRIVILEGES HE WAS GOING TO IMPOSE SOME MILD SANCTIONS AGAINST CHINA AND EVERY HEADLINE THE NEXT DAY SAID CLINTON CAVES IN BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN IT WAS ANOTHER FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE HAD SAID THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS A TERRIBLE THING THAT PRESIDENT BUSH IS DOING AND NOW YOU CAN'T MUCH TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT BUSH'S POLICY AND HIS POLICY 
GWEN ONE REASON WHY HE GOT HAMMERED PRETTY HARD FROM SOME QUARTERS ON THE DECISION ON TRADE WITH CHINA IS THAT YOU HAD BEFORE IT THE HAITI REVERSAL THE BOSNIA FLIP FLOPS AND SO FORTH 
DO THEY THINK AT THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PRESIDENT'S IMAGE IN THE WORLD 
MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY OTHERS ABOUT THAT 
YOU HEAR THE EUROPEAN LEADERS SAY THAT 
DO THEY THINK THAT INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND IF SO WHAT DO THEY WANT TO DO ABOUT IT 
I THINK THEY DO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM BUT I THINK IT GOES DEEPER IF THAT'S POSSIBLE THAN JUST THE PRESIDENT'S IMAGE IN THE WORLD 
I THINK IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S IMAGE PER YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT PAULA JONES 
YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW FREE HELICOPTER RIDES 
IT ALL COMES BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CREDIBILITY 
BUT LET ME TRY TO PUT A SMILEY FACE ON SOME OF THIS 
THE PRESIDENT IS CONNECTED TO ROSTENKOWSKI THERE'S NO QUESTION 
BUT MAYBE THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME NEW INCENTIVE FOR HIM TO GET THIS HEALTH CARE THING ROLLING AGAIN 
HEALTH CARE HAS BEEN SLOWED 
IT'S BEEN DECLARED DEAD MANY TIMES BEFORE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE MR. BRODER AND MAYBE IT WILL REVIVE COME BACK AGAIN 
AND THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE HELICOPTER RIDE IS THAT FOR A CHANGE INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE SCANDAL TO GROW AND GROW AND DRAG ON THE PRESIDENT MINDFUL THAT HE WAS LEAVING THIS WEEK NEXT WEEK FOR D. DAY FESTIVITIES IN EUROPE FIRED THE GUY RIGHT OUT AND DIDN'T TAKE ANY TIME 
WELL THERE ALSO IS GOOD NEWS ABOUT CHINA 
YES 
FROM A DOMESTIC POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE IN ONE WAY HE WAS BEING VERY CONSISTENT 
BILL CLINTON SAID ALL ALONG I'M GOING TO RETURN ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS TO A CENTRAL POSITION IN FOREIGN POLICY 
THE AMERICANS SELL NINE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS TO CHINA IT'S WORTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS 
AND NO ISSUE IN THE FALL CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE MORE HELPFUL EITHER THIS YEAR OR IN NINETY SIX TO BILL CLINTON 
THAN JOBS 
THAN JOBS 
THAT'S RIGHT 
ABSOLUTELY 
THIS IS THE GOOD NEWS WHICH GOT OBSCURED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SO CLOSE TO FORM AND CHANGING HIS MIND AGAIN ON A FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE 
WHEN HE WENT TO THE HILL THIS WEEK HE WENT AND MET WITH DEMOCRATS AFTER THE RACE IN KENTUCKY AND HE TALKED ABOUT WARNED THEM ABOUT RIGHT WING FANATICS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT ARE LIABLE TO BE ELECTED IN THE FALL CAMPAIGN 
HE SAID HELD HOSTAGE BY THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
NOW DOESN'T HE NEED SOME REPUBLICAN VOTES TO GET THIS HEALTH CARE PACKAGE THROUGH 
AND WASN'T THIS A LITTLE TOUGH THIS RHETORIC IF HE'S LOOKING FOR SOME SUPPORT BY THE REPUBLICANS LIKE HE GOT ON NAFTA 
MMM HMM 
IF YOU WERE LISTENING HE ALSO HAD SOME PRETTY TOUGH RHETORIC THIS WEEK WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT ABORTION WHEN HE SIGNED A CLINIC ACCESS BILL 
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE TERRORISM OF PEOPLE WHO RESTRICT ACCESS FOR WOMEN SEEKING ABORTIONS 
I THINK HE'S KICKING SOME OF THAT AWAY 
I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS REALIZED THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET ON ISSUES SUCH AS HEALTH CARE AND THAT WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO FOCUS ON ARE THE PEOPLE THEY CAN GET 
WE FOLKS ARE OUT OF TIME 
I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR BEING HERE 
NEXT WEEK WE'LL LOOK AT D. DAY CELEBRATIONS WITH A SPECIAL GUEST BY SATELLITE WHO WILL GIVE US SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM LONDON 
THAT GUEST 
PAUL DUKE 
I'M KEN BODE 
THANKS FOR WATCHING
