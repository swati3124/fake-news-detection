TWO TIME OSCAR WINNER MERYL STREEP GIVES UP ACCENTS IN FAVOR ACTION IN HER NEW FILM THE RIVER WILD 
THE FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD ACTRESS FACED THE MOST PHYSICALLY DEMANDING ROLE OF HER CAREER 
C. N. N.'S SHERRI SYLVESTER WENT TO THE RIVER'S EDGE TO TALK TO STREEP 
AS THE CAMERAMAN MOVES INTO POSITION WITH THE HELP OF A ROPE THE RESCUE TEAM OVERHEAD 
THEY HAVE LIFE AND NETS READY TO TOSS INTO THE WATER BELOW 
THE FOCUS OF THE CAMERA CREW AND THE SAFETY CREW IS MERYL STREEP 
THE THING THAT LOOKS SO TINY AND IS JUST THIS LITTLE RAFT THAT FROM THE SHORE WHEN YOUR HEAD IS IN IT THE WAVES LOOK YOU KNOW SIX FEET TALL 
AND THAT WAS VERY SOBERING 
HER FIRST DAY OF PREPPING FOR THE RIVER WILD INCLUDED A THIRTY EIGHT MILE ROWING TRIP 
TRAINER BURNS TOSSED HER INTO THE WATER SO SHE COULD FEEL THE FORCE OF THE CURRENT 
STREEP HAD ALREADY SPENT FOUR MONTHS EXERCISING THREE HOURS A DAY 
YOGA PROVED THE MOST HELPFUL 
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS GOING DOWN REALLY DANGEROUS WATER IS A QUESTION OF NERVE AND CONFIDENCE AND INTEGRATED BREATHING AND COURAGE 
THE REAL GOOD RAFTERS TEND TO BE WOMEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY READ THE WATER AND THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NEGOTIATE 
MEN JUST THINK I'LL POWER THROUGH AND YOU CAN'T 
IT'S JUST TWENTY THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND IS TOO MUCH WATER 
ARNOLD CAN'T DO THAT 
NOW THERE'S A STORY OUT THERE THAT YOU ALMOST BOUGHT IT 
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES WHERE I WAS OUT OF CONTROL BUT WE WERE IN DANGER ALMOST ALL THE TIME 
I EMERGED WITH A VERY HEALTHY RESPECT FOR REAL DANGER NOT MOVIE DANGER BUT REAL DANGER WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING YOURSELF IN JEOPARDY 
DID YOU TRY TO PREPARE YOUR FAMILY YOUR KIDS OR YOUR HUSBAND FOR WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE DOING 
I CAME HERE THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE A MOVIE AND THINK THEY'D FAKE A LOT OF IT 
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE WHAT IT WAS 
I DO HAVE ONE MEMORY OF MY HUSBAND STANDING UP ON THE ROCKS LIKE THIS 
WATCHING WHAT I WAS DOING 
HE WAS WORRIED AT ONE POINT 
STREEP IS MARRIED TO SCULPTOR DON 
THEY HAVE FOUR CHILDREN BUT HE IS RARELY SEEN DURING HER PUBLIC APPEARANCES 
DID YOUR HUSBAND EVER HAVE TO RE ESTABLISH HIS IDENTITY BEING MARRIED TO YOU 
HE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE ME TO TALK ABOUT IT ON T. V. 
HE'S AN ARTIST AND SO HE HAS A VERY SOLITARY KIND OF ENDEAVOR WHICH I ENVY HIS ABILITY TO GO INTO THE STUDIO AND BASICALLY MAKE UP HIS LIFE OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH I HAVE PEOPLE GOING LIKE THIS AND PADDING YOU AND PUT THIS ON YOU KNOW AND I NEED THAT IN ORDER TO GET ME GOING
