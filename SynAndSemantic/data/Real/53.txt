FREDDIE KRUGER IS GONE AND AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL JASON HAS HUNG UP HIS HOCKEY MASK BUT THE HERO OF THE FILM SERIES IS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE HORROR BUSINESS 
DENNIS MICHAEL VISITED THE SET AND THE MINDSET BEHIND THREE 
THREE BRINGS THE DEMON TO NEW YORK'S UNDERGROUND CLUB SCENE WHERE HE RAISES MORE THAN A LITTLE HELL 
THE SERIES HORROR FILM IN GENERAL SEEMS TO BE RUNNING OUT OF STEAM RIGHT NOW EXCEPT FOR THE SERIES 
BEST SELLING NOVELIST CLIVE BARKER CREATED THE SITUATION IN HIS SHORT STORY THE HEART 
IN THREE HE'S EXECUTIVE PRODUCER 
WE HAVEN'T GOT OUR TONGUE ANYWHERE OUR CHEEK AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE SERIOUS HORROR MOVIES IN MY OPINION SORT OR INTO COMEDY 
I LIKE MY HORROR FAIRLY AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CHARACTER WHO TOOK HIMSELF RATHER SERIOUSLY 
ACTOR DOUG BRADLEY SEEN HERE TAKING AN UNCHARACTERISTIC COFFEE BREAK HAS PLAYED A CHARACTER HE DESCRIBES AS A DEMONIC OSCAR IN ALL THREE 
THERE'S A LOT OF SIMILARITIES I THINK BETWEEN THE MYTHOLOGY AND THE FAUST LEGENDS 
THE DESIRE TO WANT TO KNOW ALL THERE IS TO KNOW AND THAT AS SOON AS SOMEONE PUTS A BOUNDARY BEYOND THIS IS NOT FOR YOUR TO KNOW 
WE ALL WANT TO BE THERE DON'T WE 
THE KEY TO THE MOVIES IS THE LAMENT CONFIGURATION PUZZLE BOX 
THE PEOPLE IN THE FILMS ARE DRAWN TO IT BY CURIOSITY AND DESIRE 
YOU NEVER OPEN THE BOX 
YOU WON'T RUN ACROSS HIM 
BUT ONCE YOU GET TO HIM HE PLAYS STRICTLY BY THE RULES 
THE MOVIES POSTULATE A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORLD VIEW 
WE'RE ALL OF US DRAWN TO THESE THINGS 
WE'RE ALL OF INVESTIGATING THEM 
AND I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO POINT TO ONE ELEMENT OF THESE MOVIES WHICH I THINK INDICATE THE AREA THAT PEOPLE MOST IT'S THERE 
IT'S THAT 
IT'S THE FACT THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A WORLD 
THE FILMS ARE FOR THE CORE HORROR AUDIENCE BUT CLYDE BARKER IS WIDENING HIS REACH ALONG WITH MANY FEATURE PROJECTS 
BARKER IS ALSO EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE SOON TO BE RELEASED 
AS FOR AND THE WELL IT DOESN'T GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY TO SUGGEST THAT THREE ENDS WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN TO ANOTHER SEQUEL
