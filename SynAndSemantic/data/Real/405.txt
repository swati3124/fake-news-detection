LISTEN TO THIS COMPOSITION BY PROFESSOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 
SOMETIMES IT'S SWEET AND FAMILIAR AT OTHER MOMENTS IT SOUNDS COMPLETELY OUT OF TUNE 
IT'S FROM A NEW COMPACT DISC OF HIS WORK CALLED AN IN SIXTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING 
THE C. D. ALSO INCLUDES TWELVE A FANFARE IN NINETEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING AND A SUITE FOR GUITAR IN FIFTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE MICRO ARE IMAGINE A PIANO KEYBOARD 
IN ANY OCTAVE SAY FROM MIDDLE C. TO HIGH C. THERE ARE TWELVE EQUAL STEPS 
YOU GO UP SEVEN WHITE KEYS AND FIVE BLACK KEYS EACH KEY A HALF STEP AWAY FROM THE NEXT 
THAT'S A STANDARD TWELVE TONE EQUAL TUNING 
NOW IMAGINE THE SAME OCTAVE DIVIDED INTO MORE EQUAL STEPS SAY NINE WHITE KEYS AND SIX BLACKS KEYS 
WELL THAT WOULD MAKE FIFTEEN NOTES TO THE OCTAVE INSTEAD OF THE FAMILIAR TWELVE 
EACH STEP WOULD BE SMALLER THAN A HALF STEP HENCE MICRO 
MORE AND SMALLER STEPS MIGHT MAKE NINETEEN OR TWENTY NOTE EQUAL TUNING 
MUSIC PLAYED IN ANY ONE OF THESE WOULD SOUND DIFFERENT FROM THE MUSIC THAT WE USUALLY HEAR 
UNDERTOOK A PROJECT SOME YEARS AGO ON A GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES TO WRITE MUSIC IN EVERY MICRO TUNING FROM THIRTEEN STEPS TO THE OCTAVE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY FOUR STEP TO THE OCTAVE 
HE CAME TO OUR CHICAGO BUREAU TO ILLUSTRATE THE NOTES THAT YOU HEAR WHEN HE DIVIDES THE OCTAVE INTO FIFTEEN NOTES 
NOW WHAT YOU CAN HEAR IS EACH ONE OF THE INTERVALS PLAYED FIRST THE LOWER NOTE AND THE HIGHER NOTE AND THEN THE TWO PLAYED TOGETHER AND YOU CAN TELL THAT IN CERTAIN CASES THE INTERVALS YOU HEAR SOUND RATHER LIKE THE ONE WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH BUT IN OTHER CASES THEY SOUND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
AND THE FIRST ONE IS A LITTLE BIT ALIEN BUT NOT EXTREMELY SO 
NOW THE SECOND ONE'S A LITTLE BIGGER A RATHER STRANGE SOUND 
NOW A LITTLE BIGGER A VERY STRANGE SOUNDING ONE 
THAT ONE SOUNDS FAMILIAR 
THAT ONE SOUNDS FAMILIAR ALSO 
NEXT ONE'S A BIT TWISTED 
NOW THE NEXT ONE'S VERY WEIRD 
THE NEXT ONE'S ALSO VERY WEIRD 
NOW YOU GOT A MORE FAMILIAR ONE 
ANOTHER FAMILIAR ONE 
ANOTHER FAMILIAR ONE 
NOW COMES A STRANGE ONE 
ONE THAT'S NOT QUITE AS STRANGE 
AND THEN FINALLY THE OCTAVE ITSELF 
NOW WHEN YOU SAY THAT SOME OF THEM SOUND FAMILIAR AND OTHERS ARE VERY STRANGE IS THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MATHEMATICS OF DIVIDING THE DOUBLING THE FREQUENCY FROM A NOTE TO ITS TO ONE OCTAVE HIGHER THAT WE HIT STEPS THAT ARE THE VERY SAME STEPS AS THEY ARE IN THE TWELVE TONE 
YES IN SOME CASES YOU DO 
IF YOU STOP AND THINK FOR A MOMENT YOU CAN DIVIDE AN OCTAVE INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS WITH EITHER THE TWELVE NOTE DIVISION OR THE FIFTEEN NOTE DIVISION 
AND SO THERE ARE TWO INTERVALS BESIDE THE OCTAVE ITSELF IN THAT ARRAY THAT ARE IN FACT IDENTICAL TO WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE PIANO 
WELL THOSE ARE THE NOTES THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU DIVIDE THE OCTAVE INTO FIFTEEN STEPS INSTEAD OF TWELVE STEPS 
NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT TWENTY THREE NOTE TUNING 
YOU WROTE A COMPOSITION FOR TWENTY THREE NOTE TUNING 
THAT IS THE LAST OF THE REALLY EXTREMELY ALIEN ONES 
THIS TWENTY THREE NOTE TUNING WHEN I HEARD IT I KNEW IT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING AND IT REMINDED ME A LITTLE BIT OF A SOUND OF ONE OF THESE INDONESIAN ORCHESTRAS 
YES WELL THERE WAS A THEORIST WHO A DUTCH THEORIST WHO LIVED IN INDONESIA FOR MANY YEARS WHO PUT FORTH THE HYPOTHESIS IN FACT THAT THE MODES USED IN INDONESIA ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE TWENTY THREE NOTE EQUAL TUNING 
NOW AT THE PRESENT TIME AND SCHOLARS ARE NOT PERSUADED BY HIS ARGUMENT BUT I RATHER AM 
NOW TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE FOR NINETEEN TONE 
FOR NINETEEN NOTES YOU HAVE VERY AND IN FACT THEY ARE MORE THAN WHAT IS FOUND ON THE PIANO KEYBOARD AND ALL OF THE COMMON THAT YOU FIND IN CHRISTMAS CAROLS CO EXIST IN THE NINETEEN NOTE SCALE BUT IN EVEN MORE VERSIONS 
IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN JUST ABOUT TAKE A MANUAL OF CHRISTMAS CAROLS SIT AT A NINETEEN NOTE EQUAL INSTRUMENT AND PLAY THEM AND THEY SOUND A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER AND PRETTIER THAN THEY DO ON THE PIANO 
THIS IS THE SCALE IN WHICH YOU WROTE THE FANFARE FOR THE CHICAGO RADIO STATION 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AND EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN HOW CAN IT SOUND SMOOTHER AND THAN THE VERY FOR WHICH THE CHRISTMAS CAROL WAS WRITTEN 
THE EQUAL TUNING ON THE PIANO DISTORTS THE TUNING OF THE QUITE NOTICEABLY AND IN FACT IT'S THIS DISTORTION THAT A LISTENS FOR WHEN HE TUNES A PIANO 
IT'S TO GET THE WRONG INTERVALS WRONG IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY 
SO IN A CERTAIN SENSE THERE IS AN IDEALISTIC OR TUNING FOR A WHICH ALL THESE EQUAL CAN ONLY APPROXIMATE AND IT HAPPENS RATHER BY ACCIDENT THAT THE NINETEEN NOTE IS SIMPLY CLOSER TO THE IDEAL THAN THE TWELVE NOTE 
NOW CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE TWELVE NOTE DIVISION IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S EVER BEEN USED THROUGHOUT MUSIC HISTORY 
THERE WAS AN ECCENTRIC ITALIAN INTELLECTUAL WHO BUILT A THIRTY ONE NOTE EQUAL INSTRUMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
AND IN FACT THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE TWELVE TONE TUNING CAME ABOUT MUCH LATER THAN HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN REALIZED 
I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT FIFTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING AND THE SUITE FOR GUITAR THAT YOU WROTE FOR IT AND THAT IS ON THE COMPACT DISC THAT'S NOW BEEN RELEASED 
HAVE YOU BEEN PRESENT TO WATCH AUDIENCES REACT TO THE LIVE PLAYING OF THIS PIECE IN FIFTEEN TONE EQUAL TUNING 
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT PERFORMED BEFORE A LARGE AUDIENCE OF ORDINARY CONCERT GOERS 
I'VE SEEN SMALLER AUDIENCES ON CAMPUSES BUT JEFFREY THE GUITARIST TELLS ME HE PLAYED THE PIECE EXTENSIVELY IN GERMANY AND GOT NO PECULIAR REACTION TO IT AT ALL 
AND YET NORMAN AT TELLS ME THAT ONE DAY HE PLAYED A PORTION OF THE PIECE AND FORGET TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WAS FOR FIFTEEN NOTE EQUAL TUNING AND THE LIT UP 
YOU MEAN PEOPLE PEOPLE WERE CALLING IN TO SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE RADIO STATION OR 
SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG 
THAT GUITAR IS OUT OF TUNE 
AND TO BE SURE IN A CERTAIN SENSE IT IS OUT TUNE BUT THEN IN ANOTHER SENSE THE ORDINARY TWELVE NOTE GUITAR IS OUT OF TUNE ALSO 
WE'RE JUST MORE ACCUSTOMED TO THAT ONE 
WELL I MUST SAY I FOUND MYSELF LISTENING TO THE FIFTEEN NOTE TUNING AND NODDING AND HEARING IT AND IT SOUNDING RIGHT AND VERY PLEASANT TO ME 
AND THEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A NOTE WOULD COME IN THAT SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT WAS IT JUST DIDN'T BELONG THERE 
IT WAS SOME NOTE I WAS COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR WITH 
WELL THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN THE FIFTEEN NOTE WHERE I MIGHT MAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CHOICE IF I WERE GOING TO UNDERTAKE A REVISION OF THE PIECE 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE I MUST CONFESS THEY DISTURB ME ALSO 
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH SOUND DIFFERENT WHICH I DO NOT FIND DISTURBING 
NOW CURIOUSLY ENOUGH WHEN THIS PROJECT WAS PEER REVIEWED AS ALL THE N. E. A. GRANTS ARE ONE OF THE RELATIVELY SYMPATHETIC PEER WROTE BACK IN HIS EVALUATION THAT THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT THAT THE OF FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NOTES WERE OF NO MUSICAL USE WHATEVER 
DID YOU SAY THAT WAS ONE OF THE MORE SYMPATHETIC PEER 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE MORE SYMPATHETIC ONES AND I HONESTLY DO THINK THAT I HAVE MANAGED TO DISPROVE HIS STATEMENT
