THANKS FOR JOINING US 
THE TINY NATION OF HAITI CONTINUES TO POSE BIG POLICY HEADACHES FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON 
UNDER CRITICISM FOR HIS HANDLING OF THE ONGOING CRISIS HE IS FACING CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS TO RESTRICT HIS ABILITY TO USE FORCE IN THE SITUATION 
JOINING US WITH THE LATEST IS C. N. N.'S SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WOLF BLITZER 
WOLF 
JUDY THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO HEAD OFF TWO FIGHTS ONE IN HAITI AND THE OTHER ON CAPITOL HILL 
PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS HE WILL FIGHT EFFORTS IN CONGRESS INCLUDING ONE PROPOSED BY SENATE MINORITY LEADER BOB DOLE TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD RESTRICT U. S. MILITARY OPTIONS IN HAITI OR ANY PLACE ELSE 
IN HAITI MY CONCERNS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT TO PROTECT THE AMERICANS ON HAITI THAT WOULD THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER MASS EXODUS OF HAITIANS OR THAT WOULD SEND A GREEN LIGHT TO THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY GOT THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS 
THEY GOT THE SANCTIONS LIFTED AND THEN THEY BROKE THEIR WORD ON THE GOVERNORS ISLAND AGREEMENT 
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS CONGRESS HAS NO BUSINESS ERODING THE ABILITY OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
THIS IS A TIME TO BE VERY STEADY 
THIS IS A TIME NOT TO LET THE EMOTION OF THE MOMENT AFFECT AND ERODE THE FUNDAMENTAL SEPARATION OF POWERS WHICH HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A LONG LONG TIME 
DOLE'S PROPOSAL WOULD FORCE MR. CLINTON TO GET CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL TO SEND TROOPS TO HAITI 
AND ANOTHER INITIATIVE IN CONGRESS WOULD PREVENT U. S. TROOPS FROM OPERATING ANYWHERE UNDER U. N. COMMAND WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION 
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO SAY WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING U. S. COMBAT TROOPS UNDER FOREIGN COMMAND AND HE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL 
AND PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS ANNOUNCED ADDITIONAL UNILATERAL U. S. MEASURES TO STEP UP THE PRESSURE ON THE HAITIAN MILITARY AND POLICE LEADERS 
HE'S ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S FREEZING THEIR ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES AND HE'S ALSO DENYING THEM ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES 
HE'S ALSO TELLING U. S. SHIPS OFF THE COAST OF HAITI TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE SHORE SO THAT THEY WOULD BE IN SIGHT OF THE HAITIAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES 
U. S. OFFICIALS ARE BY NO MEANS RULING OUT MILITARY INTERVENTION TO HELP SAVE SOME OF THE ONE THOUSAND AMERICAN CITIZENS IN HAITI BUT AT THIS STAGE THAT IS A LAST DITCH OPTION 
FOR THE MOMENT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS HOPING THAT AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF SANCTIONS WOULD EVENTUALLY CONVINCE THE HAITIAN MILITARY TO PLAY BALL 
JUDY 
WOLF HOW DEFENSIVE IS THE ADMINISTRATION FEELING ON ALL THIS 
I MEAN THERE'S ALL THESE NEWS REPORTS OVER THE WEEKEND CRITICISM OF THE PRESIDENT 
THERE'S EVEN CRITICISM NOW COMING FROM THE PREVIOUS BUSH ADMINISTRATION EVEN A FEW WORDS FROM PRESIDENT BUSH HIMSELF FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE BAKER 
DO THEY FEEL UNDER SIEGE OR WHAT 
WELL THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SENIOR OFFICIALS ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE 
THEY DON'T THE FACT THAT THEIR INTERNATIONAL POLICY IS COMING UNDER SUCH WIDESPREAD CRITICISM THE POLICY IN SOMALIA THE POLICY IN HAITI THE POLICY IN BOSNIA AND THE PRESIDENT IS REPEATEDLY TRYING TO EMPHASIZE SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL POLICY DECISIONS IN RUSSIA MOST RECENTLY 
SO THEY ARE FEELING ON THE DEFENSIVE 
THEY DON'T LIKE THE CRITICISM COMING FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THOUGH THEY EXPECT IT 
THEY THINK IT WILL GET EVEN LOUDER AS THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION STARTS GETTING UNDERWAY 
ALL RIGHT 
WOLF BLITZER AT THE WHITE HOUSE
