FROM TUSCALOOSA ALABAMA A MYSTERY 
DOES A SHADOWY CONSPIRACY HOLD A SECRET AND POWERFUL GRIP ON STUDENT GOVERNMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA 
CRITICS SAY YES 
C. N. N.'S PAT ETHERIDGE INVESTIGATES THE MACHINE 
UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA'S CRIMSON TIDE IS A FOOTBALL POWERHOUSE 
BUT THE FOOTBALL TEAM IS NOT THE ONLY POWERHOUSE ON THIS CAMPUS 
IT'S EASIER TO WIN A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA THAN IT IS FOR AN INDEPENDENT TO SUCCEED IN GETTING ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE 
HERE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS 
HISTORICALLY CONTROLLED BY THE MACHINE A SHADOWY COALITION OF WHITE FRATERNITIES AND 
IT'S 
IT'S NOT SO MUCH A VOTING BLOCK EXISTS BUT A VOTING BLOCK EXISTS THAT YOU CANNOT BECOME A PART OF UNLESS YOU'RE IN A SELECT FRATERNITY UNLESS YOU ARE A WHITE AND THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY HAVE ANY POWER IN UNLESS YOU ARE A MALE 
THE MACHINE HAS BEEN A FORCE ON THIS CAMPUS FOR DECADES HOLDING SECRET WEEKLY MEETINGS AIMED AT GETTING ITS PEOPLE ELECTED AND REIGNING OVER STUDENT GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES 
YET ON THIS CAMPUS OF TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THE MACHINE REMAINS FIRMLY UNDERGROUND 
MEMBERS TAKE LIFETIME VOWS OF SECRECY 
THIS FORMER MEMBER AGREED TO TALK ON THE CONDITION HE WOULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED 
BY BEING SECRETIVE THEY DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
AND THEY CAN ALWAYS SAY WELL WE TECHNICALLY DON'T EXIST 
THIS ALSO ADDS TO THE MYSTIQUE ABOUT IT IT ADDS TO THE TO ITS POWER 
THE REAL NAME IS AND THE GREEK LETTERS SPELL ONE 
ONE AS IN ONE VOICE ONE POINT OF VIEW 
IN RECENT YEARS IN THE WAKE OF INDEPENDENT CHALLENGES FROM WOMEN AND MINORITIES IT'S EVOLVED FROM A POLITICAL LOBBY INTO SOMETHING SINISTER 
THERE HAVE BEEN WIRE TAPS BREAK INS CARS HAVE BEEN RUN OFF THE ROAD 
THERE HAVE BEEN PHYSICAL ASSAULTS IN HOMES OF CANDIDATES 
RILEY WHO LAUNCHED A STRONG CAMPAIGN AS AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE THIS YEAR PAID A PRICE 
YOU GET EMOTIONALLY YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP A LOT OF THAT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN BEATEN UP I'VE GOTTEN DEATH THREATS 
TWO WEEKS AGO AT HER HOME SAYS SHE WAS ASSAULTED BY A MASKED MAN 
A MAN WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS MESSING WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS BUT THE ATTACK IS WIDELY BELIEVE TO BE THE WORK OF THE MACHINE 
AS A RESULT ADMINISTRATORS CALLED OFF THE ELECTION SET FOR THIS WEEK 
RILEY IS NOT THE FIRST INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE RUNNING WITHOUT THE MACHINE ENDORSEMENT TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES 
THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL 
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PHILOSOPHY THAT WINNING IS THE ONLY THING 
WHEN FRAN SON GAINED A FOLLOWING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE MACHINE TARGETED THE FAMILY BUSINESS A LOCAL PIZZA PLACE THAT CATERED TO FRATERNITIES 
THE RETRIBUTION WAS INCREDIBLE 
IT APPEARED THAT SELECTIVELY THE FRATERNITIES AND THAT WERE MACHINE CHOSE NOT TO BUY PIZZA FROM US ANYMORE 
JOEY LOST THE ELECTION AND EVENTUALLY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS 
CANDIDATES ROUTINELY SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON CAMPAIGNS AND RUNNING FOR OFFICE AT UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IS SEEN AS A SPRINGBOARD FOR HIGHER OFFICE 
BY AND LARGE STUDENTS ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY AGREE 
LET'S REINVENT STUDENT GOVERNMENT LET'S GET THE SECRECY OUT OF STUDENT GOVERNMENT LET'S OPEN IT UP LET'S GET PARTICIPATION 
IT'S TIME FOR THE MACHINE TO SHOW ITS FACE 
IF THE MACHINE EVER WERE TO COME ABOVE GROUND IT WOULD DIMINISH IN POWER 
PARTICIPATION MAY BE THE KEY 
THE POWER TO CONTROL FEEDS ON APATHY AND IN THE LAST ELECTION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE STUDENT BODY TURNED OUT TO VOTE
