IT'S AN AGE OLD ARGUMENT OVER AGE JUST WHO SHOULD PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE HEALTH COSTS OF GETTING OLD 
A CONSUMER GROUP CONCLUDES THAT UNLESS YOU'RE RICH YOU PROBABLY CAN'T AFFORD PRIVATE NURSING HOME INSURANCE SO THE GROUP IS CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO FOOT THE BILL 
BUT OPPONENTS CHARGE THAT WORKING PEOPLE ARE PAYING TOO MUCH TO PROP UP THE RETIRED AS IT IS 
C. N. N.'S DAVID FRENCH LOOKS AT THE ARGUMENTS 
HOMER OF BALTIMORE IS SEVENTY ONE AND RETIRING FROM HIS SALES JOB AT SEARS 
AS HE FEEDS THE BIRDS OUTSIDE HIS HOME HE SOMETIMES FEELS TO DEATH BY NAGGING DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO AFFORD THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY LONG TERM HEALTH CARE 
AT LUNCH WITH HIS WIFE HIS SISTER AND HER FIANCE IT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT 
THE HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION SAYS LONG TERM CARE COSTS SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR NOW BUT IS EXPECTED TO MORE THAN DOUBLE BY THE END OF THIS DECADE 
THE ELDERLY LOBBY FAMILIES U. S. A. SAYS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS NOW BEYOND MOST AMERICANS AGED FIFTY FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE 
FOR TODAY'S ELDERLY AND FOR TOMORROW'S ELDERLY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WILL NOT MAKE NURSING HOME CARE AFFORDABLE 
EITHER YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE PREMIUMS OR YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE CO PAYMENTS 
GROUP SAYS THAT BECAUSE SO MANY FACE FINANCIAL RUIN WHEN THEY ENTER A NURSING HOME THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP IN DEEPER 
WE NEED A MUCH LARGER SOLUTION AKIN TO THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE OR A PROGRAM LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY TO MAKE NURSING HOME CARE AFFORDABLE 
CONGRESS HAS GRIDLOCKED ON A SOLUTION COMING CLOSEST WITH A PLAN EXPANDING MEDICAID TO COVER IN HOME LONG TERM CARE 
IT'S EXPECTED TO BE REVIVED AGAIN THIS YEAR 
BUT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THAT AND THE ONE PROPOSED BY FAMILIES U. S. A. DRAW CRITICISM FROM PEOPLE LIKE PAUL HEWITT OF THE NATIONAL TAXPAYER'S UNION 
WE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS WHERE WE'RE TAXING HAMBURGER TO PAY THE GOLF FEES OF RETIRED DOCTORS IN BOCA RATON 
THESE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THEIR OWN LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AND WE SHOULDN'T CRY TEARS OVER THEIR PLIGHT 
ELMER HOPES WASHINGTON GETS IT RIGHT 
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S HEALTH CARE REFORM PLAN IS DUE ON CONGRESS' DOORSTEP IN MAY 
I'VE HAD AT LEAST AN OBJECTIVE FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM ALONG AND I CAN SEE THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE AND SO THERE'S THIS FEELING OF FRUSTRATION OF SORT OF HELPLESSNESS THAT I CAN'T 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I CAN'T DO TO CHANGE THE SITUATION
