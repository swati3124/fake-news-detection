SCIENTISTS FIND POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN HUMANS AND CHIMPS 
TWO VOLCANOES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA ERUPTED ON MONDAY CREATING A DISASTROUS SITUATION ON THE ISLAND OF NEW BRITAIN AND POSSIBLY SOME GLOBAL WEATHER RAMIFICATIONS 
CLOUDS OF DUST AND ASH CLIMBED OVER A MILE INTO THE SKY 
LIGHTENING CREATED BY THE THICK CLOUDS STRUCK AND KILLED ONE MAN 
RESIDENTS EVACUATED THE ISLAND AS THE VOLCANOES CONTINUED TO ERUPT ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
THE MASSIVE CLOUDS WERE EVEN SEEN BY THE THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY 
SOME SCIENTISTS PREDICT THE DUST AND ASH COULD LOWER TEMPERATURES ON EARTH IN COMING MONTHS BY BLOCKING SUNLIGHT 
SCIENTISTS THIS WEEK ANNOUNCED THEY MAY BE CLOSER THAN EVER TO FINDING THE HOLY GRAIL OF ANTHROPOLOGY THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN HUMANS AND OUR CLOSEST ANIMAL RELATIVE THE CHIMPANZEE 
SCIENTISTS REVEALED THEY HAVE FOUND THE FOSSILIZED REMAINS OF HUMANS WHICH LIVED IN WHAT IS NOW ETHIOPIA ABOUT FOUR AND ONE HALF MILLION YEARS AGO 
CRAIG HEAPS DUG DEEP FOR THE DETAILS 
SHAPES THAT COULD HOLD THE KEY TO HUMAN HISTORY 
THESE REPRESENT FOSSILS FOUND OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS FROM SEVENTEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO SCIENTISTS BELIEVE LIVED NEARLY FOUR AND ONE HALF MILLION YEARS AGO 
THESE ARE THE OLDEST HUMAN ANCESTORS YET DISCOVERED 
ANTHROPOLOGIST TIM WHITE AND HIS COLLEAGUES FOUND THE FOSSILS IN THE REGION OF NORTHERN ETHIOPIA AN AREA RICH WITH FOSSILS 
THEY DISCOVERED THE BASE OF A SKULL SEVERAL TEETH PART OF A CHILD'S JAW AND AN ENTIRE ARM 
THEY THINK THE BONES COME FROM A SPECIES THAT THEY NAMED ANCESTORS OF HUMAN BEINGS ON THE EVOLUTIONARY SCALE 
UNTIL NOW THE OLDEST FIND WAS THE SPECIES NICKNAMED LUCY WHEN DISCOVERED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE 
SCIENTISTS ESTIMATE LUCY LIVED AT LEAST THREE POINT ONE MILLION YEARS AGO 
THEY PRE DATE THE LUCY SPECIMEN HERSELF BY ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND GENERATIONS AND IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT AND SAY IT FOR ABOUT FIVE AND ONE HALF HOURS 
THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED LUCY IS DELIGHTED 
IT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT OUR MODEL HAS PREDICTED THAT YOU WOULD FIND MORE PRIMITIVE TEETH YOU FIND A MORE APE LIKE CHARACTER 
ANTHROPOLOGISTS HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT HUMANS AND CHIMPANZEES SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR GOING SEPARATE EVOLUTIONARY DIRECTIONS FOUR TO SIX MILLION YEARS AGO 
SO WE'RE GETTING VERY VERY CLOSE TO THAT COMMON ANCESTOR 
BUT DON SAYS EVOLUTION DIDN'T PROCEED AT A STEADY PACE 
SO WE HAVE TO GO BACK ANOTHER MILLION OR A MILLION AND A HALF YEARS BEFORE WE FIND OTHERS 
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TEMPO OR RATE OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE 
MAYBE THERE ARE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR SPECIES 
ANTHROPOLOGISTS SAY EACH NEW DISCOVERY ENHANCES THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND DRIVES THEM TO LOOK FURTHER 
CRAIG HEAPS FOR C. N. N. BERKELEY CALIFORNIA 
COMING UP NEXT THE LATEST IN TECHNOLOGY 
IT'S A COD PLAYER 
JUST KIDDING
