THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA CELEBRATES ITS FIFTH ANNIVERSARY ON BROADWAY TUESDAY NIGHT 
THE ANDREW LLOYD WEBER MUSICAL IS ABOUT A COMPOSER WHO THE PARIS OPERA 
PHANTOM HAS BEEN SEEN BY ALMOST THREE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ON BROADWAY AND HAS HAD MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND PERFORMANCES 
CYNTHIA TORNQUIST HAS MORE 
THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA WHICH HAD ITS UNITED STATES PREMIER ON JANUARY TWENTY SIXTH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AT BROADWAY'S MAJESTIC THEATER WENT ON TO WIN SEVEN TONY AWARDS INCLUDING BEST MUSICAL 
THE STORY OF THE PHANTOM DRAMATICALLY THEREFORE SEEMS TO ME TO BE A VERY CONTEMPORARY ONE 
THE MUSICAL IS A LOVE STORY ABOUT A COMPOSER WHO THE PARIS OPERA HOUSE 
BRITISH ACTOR MICHAEL CRAWFORD WAS THE FIRST TO PORTRAY THE PHANTOM 
THE FACE BEHIND THE CURRENT PHANTOM BELONGS TO ACTOR MARK JACOBY 
THIS CHARACTER IS A CHARACTER 
HE'S YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF MAKEUP ON TO CREATE THAT YET SOMEHOW AUDIENCES STILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE PHANTOM DESPITE THE WAY HE LOOKS 
UH HUH 
I THINK YOU'VE REALLY HIT UPON ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE OVERWHELMING SUCCESS OF THE SHOW IS THAT DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE TERRORIST WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THE PHANTOM IS AND HIS ULTIMATE APPEAL TO CHRISTINE THE MAIN FEMALE CHARACTER AND THE AUDIENCE AS A WHOLE 
THE MUSICAL HAS BROKEN EVERY ADVANCE BOX OFFICE RECORD 
ITS SUCCESS HAS CREATED A DEMAND FOR MERCHANDISE INCLUDING AND T. SHIRTS 
ITS SUCCESS IS SOMETHING THAT'S SHOWN OTHER PRODUCERS THAT A WAY TO BOTH PUBLICIZE THEIR SHOW AS WELL AS TO ADD TO ITS REVENUES IS TO MERCHANDISE IT 
INTERNATIONALLY PHANTOM HAS BEEN SEEN IN TOKYO VIENNA STOCKHOLM TORONTO AND WITH PRODUCTIONS THAT HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE STANDARD OF TOURING COMPANIES 
I WANT EVERYONE IN WHICHEVER CITY THAT THIS PRODUCTION APPEARS TO SEE THE SAME SHOW AS YOU CAN SEE ON BROADWAY OR IN LONDON 
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA CONTINUES TO BE A HOT TICKET WITH A CURRENT ADVANCE TICKET SALE ON BROADWAY OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS 
DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS PHANTOM HAS GROSSED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON BROADWAY AND ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORLDWIDE 
AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU WOULD THINK EVERY PERFORMANCE WOULD BE THE SAME 
NOT TRUE 
THERE WAS ONE TIME WHEN I DID TOTALLY BLANK OUT AND I JUST STOOD THERE AND INTO SPACE AND ON FOR A WHILE 
EVERYBODY LOVES THAT 
THE LEGEND 
OF COURSE BEING ULTIMATE PROFESSIONALS WE JUST LOOKED UPSTAGE AND WENT GO AHEAD SAVE YOURSELF
