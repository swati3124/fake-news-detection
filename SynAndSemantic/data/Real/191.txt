FROM A. B. C. NEWS IN NEW YORK TWENTY TWENTY THS CONTINUES 
IT WAS LAST SPRING THAT WE FIRST BROUGHT YOU THE STORY OF THE LITTLE GIRL AT THE CENTER OF A BITTER CUSTODY BATTLE AND NOW THIS HEARTBREAKING CASE IS DRAWING NATIONAL ATTENTION AND MAKING NEWS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
BABY JESSICA THE TWO YEAR OLD CAUGHT IN A TUG OF WAR BETWEEN HER BIRTH PARENTS AND THE COUPLE THAT HAS RAISED HER SINCE SHE WAS THREE WEEKS OLD 
AFTER A LONG AND NASTY COURT BATTLE THE CASE IS FINALLY REACHING AN END 
MICHIGAN'S HIGHEST COURT HAS MADE A FINAL RULING AND IN JUST SIXTEEN DAYS JESSICA IS TO BE TURNED OVER TO A MOTHER SHE DOESN'T KNOW 
ARE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD BEING SERVED IN THESE CASES 
SHOULD BLOOD ALONE DECIDE THE OUTCOME 
AS TOM JARRIEL REPORTED A WHILE BACK THESE HAVE BEEN THE KEY QUESTIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS VERY DIFFICULT LEGAL FIGHT 
THE COURT CALLS HER BABY GIRL C. SHE'S A TWO YEAR OLD WHO LIVES IN A CAPE COD HOUSE IN ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN WITH JAN AND ROBBIE AND THE DOG MILES BUT BEYOND HER COZY AND COMFORTABLE WORLD IS A BITTER AND PROTRACTED CUSTODY BATTLE 
ON ONE SIDE THE DEBOERS WHO HAVE RAISED ALMOST FROM BIRTH THE CHILD THEY CALL JESSICA 
I HAVE GIVEN MY HEART AND SOUL TO THIS LITTLE GIRL 
SHE IS A PART OF ME 
ON THE OTHER SIDE HER BIOLOGICAL PARENTS CARA AND DAN SCHMIDT FROM IOWA 
THEY BATTLED MORE THAN TWO YEARS IN THE COURTS TO GET BACK THE CHILD THEY CALL ANNA 
THEY HAVE NOT ADOPTED HER AND THEY NEVER WILL 
I WILL NEVER GIVE UP MY RIGHTS 
SHE IS MINE 
A DARK EYED BABY GIRL TOO YOUNG TO KNOW SHE'S THE CENTER OF A SWIRLING CONTROVERSY WHICH PITS TWO FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THE RIGHTS OF THE BIOLOGICAL PARENTS VERSUS THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
THIS EMOTIONAL LEGAL STRUGGLE BEGAN IN A HOSPITAL NURSERY IN CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA 
A HEALTHY BABY GIRL WAS BORN HERE FEBRUARY EIGHTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO AN UNWED MOTHER 
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE BIRTH THE MOTHER TOLD HER DOCTOR SHE WANTED THE CHILD PUT UP FOR ADOPTION 
WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THE BIRTH THE NEW MOTHER SIGNED AWAY HER LEGAL CUSTODY OF THE CHILD AND A BOYFRIEND NAMED SCOTT WHOM SHE IDENTIFIED AS THE FATHER OF THE BABY ALSO SIGNED PAPERS PERMITTING A CHILDLESS COUPLE IN MICHIGAN TO ADOPT THE LITTLE GIRL AND TAKE HER HOME 
END OF THE STORY 
HARDLY 
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A HEART WRENCHING TUG OF WAR WITH THE FUTURE OF AN INNOCENT CHILD AT STAKE 
THE BABY'S MOTHER CARA SCHMIDT IS FROM A SMALL FARM TOWN OF SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE OUTSIDE CEDAR RAPIDS 
SHE WAS TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD WHEN SHE DISCOVERED SHE WAS PREGNANT 
SHE CARRIED HER SECRET ALONE HIDING HER PREGNANCY FROM OTHERS FOR EIGHT MONTHS 
THE STRESS SHE CLAIMS PREVENTED HER FROM THINKING CLEARLY ABOUT WHAT TO DO 
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER DELIVERING HER BABY THAT SHE BEGAN TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ADOPTION 
WHY DID YOU AGREE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE THIS CHILD ADOPTED 
THERE WAS NO THOUGHT LIKE MY MIND CLICKED OFF AND IT WAS JUST THIS ADOPTION THOUGHT POPPED INTO MY HEAD AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY 
I WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON 
IN ORDER FOR THE ADOPTION TO PROCEED THE BIRTH MOTHER AND BIRTH FATHER BOTH WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP CUSTODY OF THE CHILD 
TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS CARA KNOWINGLY NAMED THE WRONG MAN HER BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME SCOTT AS THE FATHER 
DAN SCHMIDT IS THE BIRTH FATHER 
HE AND CARA DATED FOR FIVE MONTHS BUT THE RELATIONSHIP ENDED EARLY IN THE PREGNANCY WITHOUT HIM KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO BE A FATHER 
SOON AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN CARA TOLD DAN HE WAS THE FATHER 
I CRIED MY EYES OUT 
WE SAT THERE AND HELD EACH OTHER AND HUGGED EACH OTHER AND CRIED 
THEY FELL IN LOVE AND LATER MARRIED AND JOINED FORCES TO GET THE BABY BACK 
JUST DAYS AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN 
THE DEBOERS HAD THE CHILD 
THEY HAD TRIED FOR FIVE YEARS TO ADOPT A BABY AND WERE AT LAST SUCCESSFUL THEY THOUGHT 
THEIR WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN THE NIGHT THEIR ATTORNEY JOHN MONROE CALLED TO SAY CARA HAD CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE ADOPTION AND HAD LIED ABOUT THE FATHER 
AT THIS POINT JUST A FEW WEEKS AFTER LEARNING THIS WAS THE TRUE BIRTH PARENTS WHY NOT STEP BACK AND LET THE CHILD GO BACK TO THEM 
IT WAS EXPLAINED TO US THAT THE BIRTH MOTHER'S RIGHT WAS VOLUNTARILY TERMINATED 
WE HAD ALL THE PAPERWORK STATING SO 
THE BIRTH FATHER THE NEW ONE DANIEL SCHMIDT WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT HE WAS THE BIRTH FATHER THROUGH BLOOD TESTING 
IF WE WERE TO BREAK ALL TIES THAT WOULD MEAN THAT JESSICA WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO INTO FOSTER CARE 
THE STAGE WAS THUS SET FOR A LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLE OVER A CHILD 
ROBBIE AND JAN FOUGHT ON VICTORY IN EACH DAY THEY COULD BE WITH THE BABY THE BIRTH PARENTS BELIEVED THEY HAD VIRTUALLY STOLEN AWAY FROM THEM 
THE ACT THEY CONTEND TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER BIRTH WHEN THE LAWYER KNOCKED ON THE NEW MOTHER'S HOSPITAL DOOR 
HE SAID DO YOU WANT TO SIGN THE RELEASE AND SHE SAID THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO 
ACCORDING TO CARA THE ATTORNEY JOHN MONROE CAME TO HER HOSPITAL ROOM FORTY HOURS AFTER THE BABY'S BIRTH WITH PAPERS FOR HER TO SIGN GIVING UP THE BABY 
IOWA LAW REQUIRES A WAITING PERIOD OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS AFTER THE BIRTH 
NOW WITH A BIRTH FATHER DETERMINED TO GET THE BABY BACK AND THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR PROVISION ON HER SIDE THINGS LOOKED GOOD FOR CARA 
BUT THEN AN IOWA JUVENILE COURT RULED AGAINST HER ONE MONTH AFTER THE BABY'S BIRTH 
IT WAS AN ENORMOUS SETBACK 
BEFORE THAT I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ALL THE LITTLE CLOTHES AND THE AND THE DIAPERS AND THE BOTTLES AND FORMULA BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D BE HOME THEN 
THE CASE OF BABY GIRL C. WENT BACK TO THE COURTS 
MORE ARGUMENTS MORE MONTHS PASSED WITH A LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE AND FUTURE STILL IN DOUBT 
WILL SHE CONTINUE TO LIVE HERE WITH JAN A PRINTER AND ROBBIE FORMERLY AN INTERIOR DESIGNER NOW A FULL TIME MOTHER 
THEY HAVE A STABLE MARRIAGE AND ROOTS IN THE COMFORTABLE SUBURBAN ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY 
OR WILL THE LITTLE GIRL WIND UP HERE IN THE SCHMIDT FAMILY A BIG CLOSE KNIT IOWA CLAN OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND KIDS WHO CLOSELY SUPPORT EACH OTHER 
DAN IS A AND CARA AN OFFICE WORKER 
ON THE LEGAL FRONT THE DEBOERS ATTACKED THE HISTORY OF DAN SCHMIDT AS A PARENT OF TWO OTHER CHILDREN 
HE HAS A BOY NOW SIXTEEN YEARS OLD FROM A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE AND A DAUGHTER BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK WHO IS THIRTEEN 
TO YOU DAN THE COURT SAID SPECIFICALLY YOU HAVE A POOR PERFORMANCE RECORD AS A PARENT 
THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT THE DEBOERS HAVE SAID 
IN FACT THE COURT SAID THAT DAN SCHMIDT HAD LARGELY FAILED TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT HIS OTHER CHILDREN AND THAT HE HAD FAILED TO MAINTAIN MEANINGFUL CONTACT WITH EITHER OF THEM 
THE QUESTION OF WHAT KIND OF A PARENT YOU WOULD MAKE SEEMS TO BE VERY RELEVANT 
HOW CAN THE PUBLIC SAY WHAT KIND OF PARENT I'M GOING TO BE 
ASK MY SON 
I MEAN HE TREATS ME LIKE THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD AND THERE'S NOBODY THAT CAN SAY HE DOESN'T BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW AND IF THEY ASK ME THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS 
THE OPINION OF RECORD AS A PARENT 
YOU HAVE TWO CHILDREN OUT THERE 
START CARING FOR THOSE CHILDREN WHO NEED A FATHER 
BOTH OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE FATHERLESS TO THIS DAY 
THE LEGAL WRANGLING FINALLY REACHED THE IOWA SUPREME COURT 
THIS PAST SEPTEMBER BY AN EIGHT TO ONE VOTE THEY UPHELD A LOWER COURT RULING THAT CUSTODY OF THE BABY SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO DANIEL SCHMIDT SAYING HE WAS THE FATHER AND THE ADOPTION PROCESS WHICH HAD EXCLUDED HIM WAS FATALLY FLAWED 
IRONICALLY IN RULING AGAINST THEM THE IOWA COURT SAID THE DEBOERS PROVIDED EXEMPLARY CARE FOR THE BABY GIRL 
HOWEVER THE IOWA COURTS DID NOT EVEN CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD THAT IS WHETHER SHE SHOULD REMAIN WITH THE DEBOERS OR BE RETURNED TO THE SCHMIDTS BASED ON WHAT WOULD BE IN HER BEST INTEREST 
YOU CAN'T SAY THOUGH THAT CARA MIGHT NOT BE JUST AS MUCH OF A LOVING MOTHER 
NO AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ARGUMENT 
WE HAVE GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR JESSICA'S WELL BEING 
THERE MIGHT BE BLOOD THERE BLOOD TIES BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE ANYTHING PSYCHOLOGICALLY IN JESSICA'S MIND 
WE ARE HER PARENTS WE ARE HER ONLY PARENTS 
SHE'S SPENT TWO YEARS IN ANOTHER HOME 
WHEN SHE LOOKS UPON THE FACE OF ANOTHER WOMAN SHE SAYS WHEN SHE LOOKS UPON THE FACE OF ANOTHER MAN SHE SAYS FATHER 
CAN THAT BE REVERSED 
CAN YOU RECAPTURE WHAT THEY SPENT TWO YEARS BUILDING IN TERMS OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS CHILD 
WHEN SHE COMES HOME SHE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY LOVE AND THAT'S THE BEST BUILDING BLOCK THERE IS 
SHE'LL FEEL SAFE SHE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLORE SHE CAN ASK US QUESTIONS AND SAY WE'LL SAY WELL YOU DO THAT BECAUSE YOUR GRANDPA DID THAT 
ALL HER MISSING PARTS ARE HERE 
THE DEBOERS HAVE DEFIED THE IOWA HIGH COURT RULING IN FAVOR OF THE BIOLOGICAL PARENTS' RIGHTS AND HAVE FACED THE THREAT OF BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR KEEPING THE CHILD 
WITH THE LEGAL TIDE RUNNING AGAINST THEM THEY THE COURTS IN THEIR HOME STATE OF MICHIGAN TO HEAR THE CASE TO DETERMINE IF IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE CHILD TO STAY WITH THEM OR BE RETURNED TO THE SCHMIDTS 
THEY WON THE FIRST ROUND 
ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH JUDGE WILLIAM RULED IT WAS IN THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST TO REMAIN WITH THE DEBOERS 
THE DECISIONS WERE A MAJOR SETBACK FOR THE SCHMIDTS BUT THEIR GRIEF DID NOT DETER THEM 
THEY PUSHED ON AND ON JULY SECOND THE SCHMIDTS WON THE FINAL ROUND OF APPEALS IN MICHIGAN'S SUPREME COURT 
BUT DESPITE THEIR LEGAL VICTORY WHAT HURTS THEM MOST IS THE DEBOERS STILL HAVE THE BABY 
DAN WHAT TO YOU IS SO IMPORTANT ABOUT GETTING THIS LITTLE GIRL BACK 
BECAUSE SHE'S MY CHILD 
I WANT TO RAISE HER I WANT TO BE A FATHER TO HER HAVE MY FAMILY 
AS THIS LEGAL MARATHON DRAGS ON A CHILD HAS GROWN OLDER AND CLOSER EACH DAY TO A MAN AND WOMAN WHO IN TWO WEEKS MAY HAVE TO SEND HER TO ANOTHER MOTHER AND FATHER WHO FEEL SHE WAS WRONGLY TAKEN FROM THEM 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON THIS JUSTICE SYSTEM TO FOLLOW THE LETTER OF THE LAW WHICH IS TO CONSIDER THAT SHE'S A HUMAN BEING NOT A PIECE OF LUGGAGE THAT SHE CAN JUST BE TOSSED BACK AND FORTH AND THAT SHE WILL HAVE PERMANENT DAMAGE IF SHE IS REMOVED 
WELL THERE'S YET ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS VERY TANGLED AND EMOTIONAL STORY AND TOM IS HERE HE'S GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT IT WHEN WE COME BACK 
WELL IN THAT CUSTODY BATTLE THE SCHMIDTS HAVE WON BUT BABY JESSICA IS STILL WITH THE DEBOERS 
AND TOM LET ME ASK YOU FIRST OFF HOW DOES IT STAND NOW 
HUGH AS OF AUGUST SECOND THE BABY IS DUE TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE SCHMIDTS BY COURT ORDER 
NOW WHAT THE ACTUAL TRANSFER WHAT'S THAT GOING TO BE LIKE WITH ALL THE ACRIMONY BETWEEN 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS THESE TWO FAMILIES HAVE BEEN AT ODDS GREATLY AND TURNING OVER THE BABY WILL BE DIFFICULT 
THE DEBOERS BY THE WAY ARE STILL CONTINUING TO BATTLE LEGALLY 
THEY RECENTLY WENT TO THE STEPS OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT AND THERE THEY HAD A PUBLIC RALLY PRESENTING THEIR POINT OF VIEW 
AND HUGH THE ATTORNEYS FOR THE DEBOERS HAVE NOW DECIDED TO FILE AN APPEAL WITH THE U. S. SUPREME COURT ASKING THE COURT TO STAY THE EXECUTION OF THE COURT ORDER WHICH CALLS FOR THAT AUGUST SECOND TURNOVER 
SO THEY'RE STILL HOPING TO APPEAL AND CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS TO APPEAL DIRECTLY TO THE U. S. SUPREME COURT 
AND THAT STAY WOULD NOT BE A DECISION IT WOULD JUST BE A STAY 
NO IT WOULD JUST HALT THE TURNOVER 
IT WOULD IN EFFECT PUT EVERYTHING IN LIMBO UNTIL THE U. S. SUPREME COURT MIGHT HEAR THE WHOLE CASE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SOME THINK THE COURT WON'T EVEN ACCEPT THE CASE 
YEAH 
WELL THE CASE WAS COMPLICATED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE LATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER BUT THERE ARE OTHER COMPLICATIONS 
RIGHT 
THE LONG APPEALS PROCESS IS WHAT'S HURT MOST IN THIS CASE HUGH 
NOT THE LAW BUT THE APPEALS PROCESS WHICH HAS GONE ON AND ON
