THEY MAY NOT REALLY BE KILLER BEES BUT THEY ARE DANGEROUS AND THEY ARE ON THE WAY 
BEES ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE SOUTHWESTERN U. S. NEXT YEAR AND THEY COULD CAUSE MAJOR ECONOMIC DAMAGE 
MORE ON THAT FROM C. N. N.'S GREG LEFEVRE 
IT'S TOUGH TO TELL THE MORE PASSIVE CALIFORNIA BEES FROM THE SUPER AGGRESSIVE BEES THAT ARE SET TO INVADE THE WEST 
YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE AND THEN THEY'RE ALL OVER YOU 
THEY TEND TO BE VERY TOUCHY 
BEE EXPERTS EXPECT TO FIND THE BEES AT THE CALIFORNIA SLASH ARIZONA BORDER THIS SPRING 
IF THEY'RE DISTURBED VERY MUCH THEY COME OUT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE INDIVIDUALS STUNG 
BEES DRIVE UP THE COST OF BY FORTY PERCENT 
MOVE COLONIES FARTHER OUT OF TOWN 
THEY SHRINK THE SIZE OF COLONIES BECAUSE THE AGGRESSIVE BEES FIGHT EACH OTHER 
THEY'RE HAVING TO PURCHASE MORE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING FOR THE HELPERS 
YOU CAN'T SEND INTO THESE WITHOUT GLOVES WHEREAS BEFORE THEY TENDED NOT TO WEAR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
SO FAR THE BEST OFFENSE IS TO KEEP THE STOCKED WITH THE CALMER EUROPEAN QUEEN BEES BUT QUEEN BEES MATE IN THE WILD 
NOW IF SHE MATES WITH THE WRONG KIND OF DRONES THE DRONES THEN THAT HYBRID OFFSPRING THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE ARE FAR MORE TOUCHY 
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE GENES START GETTING INTO OUR BEES 
THE BEE INDUSTRY WORRIES BECAUSE IT SHIPS BEES IN AND OUT OF THE STATE TO POLLINATE ORCHARDS 
RANCHERS WORRY THAT OTHER STATES MIGHT BAN CALIFORNIA BEES IF THE BEES INFILTRATE THE 
SCIENTISTS HAVE TRIED TO BREED THE AGGRESSIVENESS OUT OF BEES TURN INTO LAID BACK CALIFORNIA BEES NO LUCK 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME SORT OF GENETIC DOMINANCE FOR THE HIGH DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR THAT'S OBSERVED IN THE AFRICAN BEES OR THE BEES 
THE BEES DON'T CARE WHERE THEY LIVE 
OLD BARRELS PIPES UNDER HOMES 
PEOPLE MIGHT SEE THE BEES IN THE YARD AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THEM AND THEN THEY'LL GO OUT THERE SAY WITH A LAWN MOWER A WEED EATER AND ANTAGONIZE THE BEES AND THEN THEN THEY'LL BE ATTACKED 
BEE EXPERTS SAY THEY'RE NOT PANICKING OVER THE INVASION 
THEY'RE JUST GIVING THESE NEW BEES A WIDE BIRTH
