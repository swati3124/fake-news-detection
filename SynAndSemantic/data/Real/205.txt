GOOD DAY 
INTEREST RATES COULD BE HEADING HIGHER 
ALAN GREENSPAN THIS WEEK TOLD HOUSE MEMBERS THAT WHILE THE PACE OF THE RECOVERY IS IMPROVING INFLATION IS DISAPPOINTING 
IN HIS SEMI ANNUAL TESTIMONY TO THE HOUSE GREENSPAN SAID IF INFLATIONARY PRESSURES INCREASE THE FED WOULD HAVE TO HIKE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES 
LATER IN THE WEEK GREENSPAN CLARIFIED HIS STATEMENT BEFORE CONTENTIOUS SENATE MEMBERS WHO SAID THE THREAT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES SENDS THE WRONG SIGNAL TO BUSINESS 
THE SIGNAL WE ARE TO SEND HERE IS THAT AT SOME POINT RATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE UP 
AND WE DO THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF FOR TWO REASONS ONE FOR THE GENERAL OVERALL STABILITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE INCREASING AND I THINK VERY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT LOW INFLATION MEANS RAPID GROWTH IN PRODUCTIVITY 
DESPITE THE CLARIFICATION BONDS FELL SHARPLY 
EARLY IN THE WEEK LONG TERM YIELDS HOVERED AT ALL TIME LOWS SINKING TO AROUND SIX AND ONE HALF PERCENT 
BUT CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN'S COMMENTS SENT BOND PRICES PLUNGING MORE THAN TWO FULL POINTS PUSHING THE YIELD BACK UP TO SIX POINT SIX NINE PERCENT 
THAT SELL OFF IN THE BOND MARKET SPILLED OVER TO STOCKS 
POSITIVE CORPORATE EARNINGS HELPED PUSH STOCK PRICES HIGHER IN THE WEEK'S FIRST THREE SESSIONS WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS IN FACT HITTING A NEW RECORD WEDNESDAY 
BUT THE SUCCESS SHORT LIVED AS FALLING BOND PRICES INVESTORS 
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ENDED THE WEEK UP EIGHTEEN POINTS FINISHING AT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SIX POINT SEVEN FOUR 
ON THE BROADER AND SECONDARY MARKETS ONLY THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX FINISHED THE WEEK WITH A LOSS 
THE WEEK DIDN'T BRING ANY RELIEF TO THE MIDWEST 
MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF FARMLAND ARE UNDERWATER 
EIGHT MIDWESTERN STATES HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED DISASTER AREAS 
CROP DAMAGE IS NOW ESTIMATED AT TEN BILLION DOLLARS 
AND A CALAMITY OF THE OPPOSITE ORDER IS AFFECTING THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY 
RECORD HEAT AND CONTINUED DROUGHT CONDITIONS ARE CREATING HUGE AGRICULTURAL LOSSES 
CROP DAMAGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE IS APPROACHING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS 
WELL THERE WAS SOME GOOD NEWS THIS WEEK 
OIL PRICES CONTINUE TO FALL 
THE UNITED NATIONS AND IRAQ NEARED AN AGREEMENT TO ALLOW IRAQ TO SELL CRUDE OIL AND OPEC DELAYED A SCHEDULED EMERGENCY MEETING 
BOTH THOSE FACTORS FORCED PRICES LOWER
