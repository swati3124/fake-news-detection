ELECTION DAY IS LESS THAN THREE WEEKS AWAY IN MR. JEFFERSON'S STATE AND THAT TIGHT VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE IS IN ITS FINAL STRETCH THE CANDIDATES VYING THE SUCCEED DEMOCRAT DOUGLAS WILDER 
OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT GENE RANDALL HAS OUR REPORT 
VIRGINIA'S LAST THREE GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN DEMOCRATS 
FOUR YEARS AGO DEMOCRAT DOUGLAS WILDER BECAME THE STATE'S FIRST ELECTED BLACK CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND WITH WILDER UNABLE TO SUCCEED HIMSELF TWO TERM ATTORNEY GENERAL MARY SUE TERRY SEEMED POISED TO EXTEND HER PARTY'S STREAK AS VIRGINIA'S FIRST WOMAN GOVERNOR 
SHE HAD WIDE NAME RECOGNITION A HUGE FUND RAISING ADVANTAGE AND A THIRTY POINT LEAD IN THE POLLS 
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY 
WITH JUST OVER TWO WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION REPUBLICAN GEORGE ALLEN A FORMER CONGRESSMAN AND STATE LEGISLATOR APPEARS TO HAVE PULLED EVEN IN THE RACE 
HOW 
SOME SAY IT'S PARTY BECAUSE OF VIRGINIA'S UNHAPPINESS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT 
CLINTON BY SOME MEASURES IN THE MOST UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT IN VIRGINIA SINCE POLLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
INCREDIBLY IN SOME SURVEYS RECENTLY HE'S SHOWN UP AS HAVING A LOWER POPULARITY RATING THAN RICHARD NIXON DID DURING THE DEPTHS OF WATERGATE 
GEORGE ALLEN'S NEW STANDING HAS SPARKED A FLOW OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
HIS MESSAGE THAT HE IS THE CANDIDATE OF CHANGE THAT TERRY IS SIMPLY A PART OF VIRGINIA'S DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT TIED TO A PAIR OF UNPOPULAR FEUDING INCUMBENTS GOVERNOR WILDER AND SENATOR CHARLES ROBB 
ADVERTISEMENT STATE GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN THE ROBB WILDER TERRY YEARS HAS INCREASED FASTER THAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
ONE REASON CONTRACTS TO POLITICAL ALLIES AND CONTRIBUTORS WITHOUT COMPETITIVE BIDDING 
TERRY HITS BACK WITH THE CHALLENGE ALLEN FACES THE WRONG POLITICAL DIRECTION 
VOTES WILL BEGIN TO SEE THAT THE TYPE OF CHANGE THAT GEORGE ALLEN WOULD BRING WOULD BE CHANGE THAT WOULD TAKE VIRGINIA BACKWARDS AND TO THE RIGHT 
ADVERTISEMENT PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
AGAINST FULL FUNDING 
A TERRY T. V. ADD GEORGE ALLEN AGAINST SO MUCH GUESS WHO IS FOR HIM 
PAT ROBERTSON 
IS THAT WHAT'S BEST FOR VIRGINIA 
THAT'S JUST FEAR MONGERING 
IT'S DISTORTION AND IT ACTUALLY IS FROM A CAMPAIGN THAT IS DESPERATE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING TO TRY TO REGAIN SOME MOMENTUM THAT HAS BEEN LOST OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS 
WHEN THEY'RE NOT BASHING EACH OTHER BOTH CANDIDATES TALK A LOT ABOUT CRIME A MAJOR VOTER CONCERN 
TERRY WANTS A FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR HANDGUN PURCHASES 
IT'S NO FUN BEING THE BRUNT OF THE N. R. A. 
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S TRAGIC TO ENCOUNTER THE FACES OF THE PARENTS WHO'VE LOST CHILDREN TO HANDGUN VIOLENCE 
ALLEN WHO IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OPPOSES FURTHER GUN CONTROLS 
HIS ANTI CRIME PITCH 
PHASE PRISON PAROLES FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS BUILD MORE JAILS AND LENGTHEN SENTENCES 
WE CERTAINLY DO KNOW THAT THAT VIOLENT CRIMINAL IF HE MURDERS SOMEONE OR USES A FIREARM IN A ROBBERY THAT IF THAT PERSON'S IN PRISON THEY WON'T BE COMMITTING MORE CRIMES 
AS THE RACE HAS GOTTEN TIGHTER TERRY HAS GONE ON THE OFFENSIVE 
SHE ACCUSES ALLEN OF ENCOURAGING THE POLITICS OF HATE AIMED AT HER HISTORY OF NEVER HAVING MARRIED 
OLIVER NORTH HAS BEEN CRISS CROSSING VIRGINIA SAYING THAT I'M LESS QUALIFIED TO BE GOVERNOR BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN 
A HIGH RANKING OFFICIAL IN MY OPPONENT'S CAMPAIGN SAID THAT GEORGE IS BETTER QUALIFIED BECAUSE HE'S A FAMILY MAN 
WELL I CERTAINLY DO DISASSOCIATE MYSELF FROM THOSE REMARKS 
I HAVE IN THE PAST AND DO SO RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S A DISTRACTION AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS CAMPAIGN 
ALLEN MANY FEEL WILL BE TESTED BY AN INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE MARY SUE TERRY IN THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN AS SHE SEEKS TO MAKE UP LOST GROUND 
MEANWHILE THE FINAL OF THREE T. V. DEBATES IN THE VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN IS SET FOR MONDAY NIGHT 
REPUBLICANS CAME CLOSE TO WINNING VIRGINIA FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN DEMOCRAT DOUGLAS WILDER WON THE GOVERNOR'S RACE BY FEWER THAN SEVEN THOUSAND VOTES 
THIS ELECTION TOO FIGURES TO BE CLOSE AND THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF WEEKS COULD BE A CASE STUDY IN BRUISING GUBERNATORIAL POLITICS
