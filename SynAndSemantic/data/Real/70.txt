MOBILE HOMES SEEMED TO BE A FAVORITE TARGET OF HURRICANE ANDREW AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE POLITICAL 
SOME CITIES WANT TO BAN THEM AS UNSAFE 
AS C. N. N.'S JOHN ZARRELLA REPORTS THE DEBATE HAS MADE ITS WAY TO CAPITOL HILL 
CONSIDER THESE NUMBERS OF THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MOBILE HOMES IN HOMESTEAD ALL BUT NINE WERE DESTROYED REDUCED BY HURRICANE ANDREW TO HEAPS OF CRUSHED AND DEBRIS 
OUT OF THIS RUBBLE QUESTIONS HAVE EMERGED 
SHOULD FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOUSING STANDARDS BE TOUGHER 
WOULD STRONGER REGULATIONS HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE 
DISASTER RESEARCHERS ENGINEERS FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATION GAVE TESTIMONY TUESDAY BEFORE A HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE 
THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING INDUSTRY WAS HIT AS HARD AS ANDREW HIT SOUTH FLORIDA 
MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES SHARE SIMILAR STORIES OF POORLY BUILT NON YET HUD LABELLED HOMES 
BUT A FEDERAL HOUSING OFFICIAL ARGUED THERE WASN'T MUCH THAT STOOD UP TO ANDREW'S ASSAULT 
IN THE HOMESTEAD AREA THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MANUFACTURED HOMES OBSERVED WERE DESTROYED 
AND MANUFACTURED HOMES HUD OFFICIALS SAY ARE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF LOW COST HOUSING 
IN FLORIDA ALONE MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THEM BUT IN HOMESTEAD THERE MAY BE FAR FEWER IN THE FUTURE 
CITY OFFICIALS HAVE PASSED AN ORDINANCE ALLOWING ONLY TEMPORARY PERMITS FOR MOBILE HOMES 
HURRICANE EXPERTS SAY THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT NO MOBILE HOME WILL EVER STAND UP TO A MAJOR HURRICANE 
BUT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES 
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THOSE MOBILE HOME COMMUNITIES HAVE AN ON SITE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR THEIR RESIDENTS 
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME DEBATE OVER MANUFACTURED HOUSING HAS COME UP 
HURRICANES ELENA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND HUGO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BOTH STIRRED THE ISSUE 
IN FACT A NATIONAL COMMISSION WAS CREATED TWO YEARS AGO TO STUDY THE SAFETY AND REGULATION OF MANUFACTURED HOMES 
THE COMMISSION HAS YET TO MEET STILL AWAITING AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATION FROM CONGRESS
