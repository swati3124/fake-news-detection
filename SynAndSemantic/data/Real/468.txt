A BUSINESS AND RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OF SEOUL SOUTH KOREA TURNED INTO AN INFERNO TODAY THE CULPRIT A DEADLY GAS EXPLOSION AND A FOLLOWING FIRE 
WE GET DETAILS FROM SOHN JIE AE 
A NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION RIPPED THROUGH A SEOUL RESIDENTIAL AREA INJURING DOZENS OF PEOPLE AND KILLING AT LEAST THREE 
ABOUT FORTY HOUSES AND DOZENS OF CARS IN THE AREA WERE DESTROYED WHILE HUNDREDS OF WINDOWS IN NEARBY BUILDINGS WERE SHATTERED 
THE AREA IS IN WESTERN SEOUL AND IS SITUATED NEAR A MAJOR FINANCIAL DISTRICT 
POLICE SEALED OFF THE AREA CAUSING TRAFFIC CONGESTION FOR MILES AROUND 
FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FLAMES SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION BUT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TRAPPED GAS IN THE UNDERGROUND GAS STATION HINDERED EFFORTS TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AND RESCUE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN HOUSES 
POLICE EVACUATED HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS AND WORKERS AT A NEARBY SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE BLAST REPORTS SAY GAS INSPECTORS WERE SEEN ENTERING THE UNDERGROUND TUNNEL ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT TO CONDUCT A REGULAR MAINTENANCE CHECK UP 
THERE ARE SPECULATIONS THAT THE INSPECTORS MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO TRIGGER THE EXPLOSIONS 
THE INSPECTORS ARE AMONG THE PEOPLE MISSING FROM THE EXPLOSION SITE
