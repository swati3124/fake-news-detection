FROM THE WORLD BENEATH THE SEA HUMANS CONSTANTLY ARE DISCOVERING WAYS TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES 
ONE OF THE LATEST COULD LEAD TO SOME EARTH FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY 
C. N. N. SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT MILES O'BRIEN HAS MORE ON THIS PEARL OF A MATERIAL 
PART OF THIS EXTRACTED FROM OYSTER SHELLS IS A PROTEIN CALLED 
IT HELPS SURVIVE BY CONTROLLING HOW THEIR SHELLS GROW AND NOW A SYNTHETIC VERSION OF THE SAME PROTEIN MAY HELP PEOPLE PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT 
SCIENTISTS AT UNIVERSITY HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE THE PROTEIN IN THE LABORATORY 
THEY'RE HOPING IT MAY SOON BE USED IN PRODUCTS RANGING FROM TO DISPOSABLE DIAPERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SOME OF THE NON CHEMICALS NOW IN USE 
AND THEY ARE USED IN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF THESE BEING USED 
THE CHEMICALS CALLED ARE USED TO PREVENT PARTICLES IN WATER FROM CLUMPING TOGETHER 
IN THE CASE OF THEY KEEP DIRT FROM STICKING TOGETHER IN THE WASH WATER AND GETTING BACK ONTO CLEAN CLOTHES OR DISHES 
THEY'RE ALSO USED IN BOILERS AND COOLING TOWERS TO KEEP MINERAL SCALE FROM BUILDING UP AND BLOCKING PIPES AND THEY'RE USED IN THE SUPER MATERIALS THAT SOAK UP LIQUID IN DISPOSABLE DIAPERS 
RESEARCH STARTED WITH THE OYSTER PROTEIN 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT HELPS CONTROL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHELL HE FIGURED IT MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MINERAL BUILD UP IN OTHER SITUATIONS 
AND BECAUSE IT'S A PROTEIN HE KNEW IT WOULD BE 
THE QUESTION WAS WHERE TO GET ENOUGH OF THE PROTEIN TO EXPERIMENT WITH 
WE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THAT ONE COULDN'T USE EITHER NATURAL SYSTEMS TO MAKE ENOUGH PROTEIN OR WE COULDN'T EXTRACT ENOUGH PROTEIN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE FROM OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE KIND OF APPLICATIONS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
SO THEY HAD TO LEARN EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN THE PROTEIN AND THEN COME UP WITH A WAY TO MAKE IT IN THE LAB 
WHEELER SAYS THE PROCESS COULD EASILY BE SCALED UP FOR USE IN INDUSTRY 
A FORM OF THE CHEMICAL THAT WOULD WORK IN DETERGENTS IS ALMOST READY FOR MARKET 
WE'RE TALKING REALLY ABOUT ONLY MONTHS TO LESS THAN A YEAR BEFORE THAT COULD HAPPEN 
BUT WHEELER POINTS OUT IT'S UP TO MANUFACTURERS WHETHER THEY SWITCH TO THE CHEMICALS BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAW REQUIRING THEM TO CHOOSE IT 
DEVELOPING A FORM OF FOR USE IN DISPOSABLE DIAPERS IS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD BUT IT HOLDS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAKING TONS OF LANDFILL GARBAGE MORE
