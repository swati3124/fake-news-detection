THERE'S BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUSION ENERGY 
FUSION HOLD THE PROMISE OF A NEVER ENDING POWER SUPPLY AND UNLIKE OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY THERE WOULD BE NO POLLUTION 
BUT AS C. N. N.'S HARLEY HOTCHKISS REPORTS A CHANGE OVER TO FUSION ENERGY WON'T BE HAPPENING ANY TIME SOON 
SCIENTISTS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY WERE FIRED UP THURSDAY NIGHT 
THEY CHEERED THE SUCCESS OF A FOUR SECOND FUSION REACTION THAT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL EVER CREATED BY SCIENTISTS 
I THINK THIS IS A HISTORIC MILESTONE IN FUSION ENERGY DEVELOPMENT SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE WRIGHT BROTHERS' FIRST FLIGHT 
WHY ALL THE HOOPLA 
BECAUSE FUSION IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF ENERGY 
IT PROMISES A CLEAN AND NEARLY ENDLESS SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY 
FUSION FUELS THE SUN WITH THE NON STOP MEANS OF TREMENDOUS ENERGY 
SCIENTISTS HOPE TO MIMIC THE SUN HERE ON EARTH IN FUSION REACTORS 
THE FUEL FOR FUSION POWER PLANTS WOULD NOT COME FROM COAL GAS OR RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL BUT FROM WATER 
HYDROGEN ATOMS FROM WATER CAN BE FORCED TOGETHER UNTIL THEY LITERALLY FUSE 
THIS RESULTS IN THE RELEASE OF ENERGY 
NUCLEAR FUSION REACTORS WOULD NOT CREATE THE HAZARDS OR DANGEROUS WASTES THAT COME FROM NUCLEAR THE ATOM SPLITTING PROCESS THAT RUNS NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AND GIVES ATOMIC WEAPONS THEIR DESTRUCTIVE FORCE 
WHILE THE RECORD REACTION OFFERS ENCOURAGING NEWS THE HUGE PRINCETON REACTOR ACTUALLY CONSUMED EIGHT TIMES MORE ENERGY THAN IT CREATED 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE REACTOR HAD TO BE HEATED TO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DEGREES FAHRENHEIT TO TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF ENERGY 
THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THIS BILLION DOLLAR EFFORT 
AND SECRETARY OF ENERGY HAZEL O'LEARY IS GLAD TO SEE SOME RETURN ON INVESTMENT 
PART OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT OFTEN A LARGE INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE HAS A TREMENDOUSLY LONG PERIOD BEFORE WE SEE PAYOFF IN BENEFIT 
AND THIS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THE CASE WITH THIS PROJECT 
OH FUSION 
OH WE'VE BEEN FUNDING THIS FOREVER 
SO AFTER THE SIGH OF RELIEF IS LIKE 
DESPITE THE CURRENT SUCCESS SCIENTISTS SAY IT'LL TAKE DECADES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEFORE FUSION REACTORS CAN BE MADE TO CREATE ELECTRICITY CHEAPLY AND EFFICIENTLY
