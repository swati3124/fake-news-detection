THIS IS RON ALLEN IN SARAJEVO WHERE AGAIN LAST NIGHT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A CEASE FIRE 
AND THIS IS WHAT WAS LEFT OF SEVERAL HOTEL ROOMS IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY WHEN MORE ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADES HIT THEIR MARK TODAY 
FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER HAS COME TO A PLACE WHERE JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY CIVILIANS ARE BEING KILLED OR WOUNDED BY SNIPERS 
THE VICTIM SUNDAY WAS LUCKY TO SURVIVE 
A BULLET HIS THIS ELDERLY WOMAN IN THE LEG 
TONIGHT U. N. TROOPS FIRED BACK AT THE SERB GUNNERS NEAR THE ROUTE FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER TOOK INTO TOWN 
WHAT WE ARE FINDING ON THE GROUND THAT THE PROMISES AND COMMITMENTS THEY HAVE MADE TO US IN THE LAST WEEK ARE NOT BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED 
THE MOST POSITIVE SIGN OF SERB GOOD WILL WAS THE ARRIVAL OF SEVERAL PLANES CARRYING FRESH U. N. TROOPS AND SUPPLIES 
BUT THE SERBS HAVE PLACED SO MANY RESTRICTIONS ON FLIGHT AND TRUCK CONVOYS U. N. OFFICIALS FEAR SARAJEVO'S WILL CLOSE ONCE MR. CARTER FLIES HOME 
THE SERB POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE OFTEN MADE PROMISES TO MEDIATORS AND NEGOTIATORS WHICH THE MILITARY FAILS TO EXECUTE ON THE GROUND 
MANY HERE BELIEVE THEY ARE USING FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER'S VISIT TO CARRY OUT THAT SAME STRATEGY ONCE AGAIN 
IN THE BOSNIAN SERB SELF PROCLAIMED CAPITAL PALE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER MUCH CYNICISM 
HE CANNOT HELP THIS MAN SAYS 
AMERICA PRODUCED THIS WAR. JUST ABOUT EVERYONE HERE BELIEVES THE U. S. HAS SIDED WITH THE MUSLIMS 
IF CARTER DOES NOT INTEND TO SUPPORT US THIS SERB WOMAN SAYS HE SHOULD NOT BE COMING AT ALL 
TOMORROW BEFORE HEADING TO PALE CARTER SAYS HE WILL JUDGE FOR HIMSELF WHETHER MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE HE AGREED TO VISIT BOSNIA 
HE'LL TAKE A BRIEF TOUR OF SARAJEVO IN A FULLY ARMORED CAR
