IN CUBAN TERMS LORENZO WAS PRIVILEGED 
CUBA DIDN'T SEND JUST ANYONE TO STUDY IN THE SOVIET UNION ONLY THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST 
AND ONLY THE MOST TRUSTED GOT TO THEMSELVES INTO THE MIG TWENTY THREES OF THE CUBAN AIR FORCE 
LAST YEAR MAJOR LORENZO POINTED HIS MIG TOWARD FLORIDA 
HIS EIGHTEEN MINUTE FLIGHT WENT UNDETECTED BY CUBAN OR AMERICAN RADARS BUT IT HAD A BIG IMPACT ON LORENZO'S WIFE VICKY AND THEIR TWO SONS 
THEY WERE LEFT BEHIND 
SINCE HIS DEFECTION LORENZO HAS BEEN TRAVELING THE WORLD OVER TRYING TO OBTAIN THEIR RELEASE 
MAJOR LORENZO JOINS US NOW IN ATLANTA AND WE MUST NOTE THAT WE ASKED THE CUBAN INTEREST SECTION IN WASHINGTON TO SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO JOIN US BUT THIRD SECRETARY ARIEL RICARDO REFUSED SAYING YOU MAY CONSIDER LORENZO A WE CONSIDER HIM A TRAITOR 
GOOD MORNING MAJOR 
GOOD MORNING 
YOU LIVED A GOOD LIFE IN CUBA 
WHY DID YOU DEFECT 
THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT I AM A TRAITOR 
AND I ASK MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF MY COUNTRYMEN WHO WERE RAISED LIKE ME LIKE AN IDEALIST WHO WERE TO BELIEVE IN CASTRO TO BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM 
WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD I SAID TO EVERYBODY THERE AT THE SCHOOL LOOKING AT THE NATIONAL FLAG BE FOR COMMUNISM WE WILL BE LIKE 
NOW AFTER WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO RECEIVE INFORMATION TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HISTORY OF COMMUNISM 
WE KNEW FOR EXAMPLE THAT STALIN HAD KILLED MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SOVIET UNION 
I KNEW FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE CUBA HOW OUR GOVERNMENT IS KILLING ITS POLITICAL PRISONERS 
BUT YOU HAVE PAID A DEAR PRICE FOR THIS AND I KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY ASKED YOURSELF THIS MANY MANY TIMES 
YOU LEFT YOUR WIFE AND YOUR CHILDREN BEHIND 
WAS IT WORTH IT 
RIGHT 
IT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION I HAVE EVER HAD TO MAKE IN MY LIFE LEAVING BEHIND ME MY WIFE MY CHILDREN 
I COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT COULD KEEP THEM AS HOSTAGES LIKE IT'S DOING NOW IN CUBA 
SO WE HOPE THAT JUST WITH THE PRESSURE OF PUBLIC OPINION WE CAN GET MY FAMILY OUT OF CUBA 
WHAT IS THEIR STATUS NOW IN CUBA SINCE YOU'VE LEFT 
THEY HAVE BEEN GRANTED VISAS BY AMERICAN AUTHORITIES A YEAR AGO BUT AFTER FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS MY WIFE WAS SUMMONED TO THE OFFICE OF THE CUBAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE 
CASTRO WHERE SHE WAS INFORMED THAT THEY COULD NEVER LET HER OR THE CHILDREN LEAVE CUBA THAT MY CHILDREN WILL NEVER SEE THEIR FATHER 
MY CHILDREN OF COURSE CANNOT LAUGH ANYMORE LIKE CHILDREN DO 
THEY CANNOT PLAY ANYMORE LIKE CHILDREN DO 
JUST GOD CAN KNOW HOW MUCH PAIN THEIR SMALL HEARTS STAND NOW 
WE HAD A REPORT ON THIS SHOW SEVERAL DAYS AGO FROM A CORRESPONDENT NAMED DAVID SMITH WHO INDICATED IN HIS REPORT THAT IT SEEMS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE QUITE CONTENT UNDER CASTRO IN CUBA AND UNDER COMMUNISM AND THAT MUCH OF THEIR RESENTMENT IS MORE TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE EMBARGO 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WITH ISSUES LIKE HEALTH CARE INFANT MORTALITY EDUCATION BETTER UNDER COMMUNISM IN THAT COUNTRY THAN COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM IS WORKING IN CUBA 
I DON'T THINK SO 
THE COMMUNISM WAS AN EXCUSE TO OPPRESS OUR PEOPLE IN CUBA TO KEEP A DICTATORSHIP IN OUR COUNTRY 
EVERYBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS THAT FACT NOW IN CUBA 
SO CASTRO USES EXCUSE OF IMPERIALISM LIKE THE UNITED STATES TO DEVELOP A BIG REPRESSION INSIDE THE COUNTRY 
NOW THE NEW MAN WHO WANTS TO PLACE BY CASTRO IS THINKING ABOUT THE PARTY IS THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORY IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE IS SEEING NOW AND THE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPORTING CASTRO 
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE EMBARGO WILL PUT THE FINISH TO CASTRO'S REGIME 
I THINK THE CUBAN PEOPLE NEED INFORMATION 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CUBA WERE THEY WERE SUPPORTING CASTRO 
THEY HAVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH 
CASTRO HAS THE CONTROL OF ALL THE INFORMATION MADE PUBLIC IN CUBA 
HE DOES THOUGH HAVE YOU MUST ADMIT ENORMOUS APPEAL IN CUBA AMONG CUBANS 
RIGHT 
OKAY 
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW STRONG THE OPPOSITION IS TO CASTRO IN CUBA 
THE OPPOSITION IS BASICALLY IN FEELING IT IS NOT VERY STRONG 
BUT MOST OF THE CUBAN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE IS EXISTS OPPOSITION INSIDE CUBA BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO THE MEDIA TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE DOESN'T HAVE REGISTRATION AND TELEVISION OR NEWSPAPER 
SO OF COURSE PEOPLE CANNOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE THEIR OWN COUNTRY 
ARE YOU COMMUNICATING AT ALL WITH PEOPLE INSIDE OF CUBA OTHER THAN YOUR FAMILY 
NUMBER 
I'M COMMUNICATING JUST WITH MY FAMILY 
I'M NOT TO SEE THEM 
SO I JUST WANT TO LIVE LIKE A FATHER LIKE A HUSBAND TO RAISE MY CHILDREN 
I'M GOING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR SUPPORT TO GET MY FAMILY OUT OF CUBA 
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERFUL PEOPLE ARE HELPING US LIKE MRS. CORETTA SCOTT KING WHO WROTE A LETTER TO FIDEL CASTRO ASKING FOR MY FAMILY'S RELEASE 
NOW THE FOUNDATION WHICH IS IN WASHINGTON IS HELPING US TO GET MY FAMILY OUT OF CUBA 
IT IS ORCHESTRATING A CAMPAIGN AN INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN EXPLAINING TO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY FAMILY 
WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO HELP US GET MY FAMILY OUT OF CUBA 
JUST WRITE LETTERS 
FOR EXAMPLE A THOUSAND OF THESE CARDS WERE PLACED BY THE FOUNDATION IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES FOR THIS WRITING 
PLEASE ALLOW THE LORENZO FAMILY TO LEAVE CUBA 
THAT CARD YOU CAN SEND TO FIDEL CASTRO PRESIDENT FIDEL CASTRO AND TO YOUR CONGRESSMEN ASKING TO INTERVENE BEFORE THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO GET MY FAMILY OUT OF CUBA FOR THE RELEASE OF MY FAMILY 
ALL RIGHT 
MAJOR LORENZO THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY
