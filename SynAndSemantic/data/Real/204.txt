HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS TRYING TO WORK OUT A COMPROMISE DEFICIT REDUCTION BILL MADE A LITTLE PROGRESS THIS WEEK 
THE PACKAGE IS AIMED AT CUTTING THE DEFICIT BY FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
THE CONFEREES TENTATIVELY AGREED TO RAISE TAXES ON THE BENEFITS OF SOME SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS BUT AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN PRESIDENT CLINTON ORIGINALLY SOUGHT 
THEY ALSO AGREED TO MAKE RETROACTIVE TO MARCH FIRST A HIGHER TAX RATE FOR UPPER MIDDLE INCOME AND WEALTHY AMERICANS IN ORDER TO RAISE MORE MONEY 
AND THE NEGOTIATORS KILLED A SENATE PLAN TO PUT A SURCHARGE ON THE CAPITAL GAINS EARNINGS OF WEALTHIER TAXPAYERS 
STILL UNRESOLVED IS HOW MUCH OF AN ENERGY TAX TO INCLUDE IN THE PACKAGE 
THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE HAS A HUGE NUMBER OF MEMBERS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED 
NPR'S BRIAN NAYLOR REPORTS ON HOW THIS UNWIELDY NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS ATTEMPT TO DO THEIR WORK 
IN AN ORDINARY HOUSE SENATE CONFERENCE THERE ARE A FEW CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES INVOLVED AND PERHAPS A COUPLE DOZEN MEMBERS 
BUT IN A BUDGET RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE THE MOTTO IS THINK BIG 
EVERY COMMITTEE THAT HAS A SAY IN SETTING TAXES USER FEES RAISING ANY SORT OF REVENUE IS INCLUDED AS ARE THOSE THAT AUTHORIZE SPENDING 
THAT MEANS JUST ABOUT EVERY COMMITTEE 
IT'S RARE THAT THEY ALL COME TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM 
THEY ARE GROUPED INTO SUB CONFERENCES EACH WITH ITS OWN SECTION OF THE BILL TO WORK ON EACH WITH AT LEAST FIVE MEMBERS 
THAT'S A DEPARTURE FROM PAST PRACTICE AND THE REASON WHY THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ITSELF IS SO HUGE 
PETER ROBINSON A FORMER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC STAFF SAYS THE BIGGER SUB CONFERENCES GIVE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS MORE CONTROL THAN THEY USED TO HAVE WHEN THERE WERE JUST THREE MEMBERS 
IF YOU HAVE TWO DEMOCRATS AND ONE REPUBLICAN ON EACH COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVE JUST ONE DEMOCRAT THAT'S UH SQUISHY ON THE ISSUE OR THAT HAS SOMETHING TO GAIN EITHER IN HIS PART OF THE CONFERENCE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE HE CAN BASICALLY PREVENT THE CONFERENCE FROM CONCLUDING BECAUSE EACH SEPARATE COMBINATION OF CONFEREES HAS TO SIGN ON FOR THERE TO BE A SUCCESSFUL CONFERENCE REPORT 
WHILE THE SUB CONFERENCE MEMBERS ARE WORKING ON THEIR TECHNICAL PARTS OF THE BILL DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN CONGRESS ARE CONSTANTLY TAKING THE TEMPERATURE OF MEMBERS SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE 
FOR INSTANCE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE PLAN IS HOW MUCH OF AN ENERGY TAX IT SHOULD INCLUDE 
LOUISIANA DEMOCRAT BILLY TAUZIN IS OPPOSED TO ANY ENERGY LEVY AND HAS TOLD THIS TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INFORMAL CAUCUS OF HOUSE CONSERVATIVES 
W. J. BILLY TAUZIN D. L. A. HE NEEDED TO KNOW THAT 
THAT INFORMATION THEN GETS CHANNELED BACK TO THE LEADERSHIP SO THEY CAN DO A PROPER HEAD COUNT SO THEY CAN KNOW WHETHER OR NOT DECISIONS THEY'RE MAKING IN A CONFERENCE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE A MAJORITY OR FALL SHORT OF A MAJORITY 
THE REAL HEAVY LIFTING IS DONE IN THE SUB CONFERENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE THAT'S THE PANEL WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THE TAXES THE PRESIDENT HAS PROPOSED AND IS RELYING ON FOR HALF OF HIS DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGET 
MOST OF THAT PANEL'S WORK WILL BE DONE OVER THE TELEPHONE OR IN CLOSED DOOR MEETINGS BETWEEN HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DAN ROSTENKOWSKI AND SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN 
MANY OF THE CONFERENCE'S MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS ARE RELATIVELY JUNIOR 
ONE IS FRESHMAN REPRESENTATIVE MIKE OF WASHINGTON STATE 
LOYALTY TO DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP HAS ALREADY BEEN REWARDED WITH A PLUM ASSIGNMENT ON THE POWERFUL ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE 
AND WHILE HE MAY NOT BE A BIG COG IN THE RECONCILIATION MACHINE HIS PART SHOULD HELP HIM WITH THE FOLKS BACK HOME 
WHEN THEY SEE ONE OF THE THE PERSON THAT THEY ELECTED TO FROM A PARTICULAR DISTRICT WHO IS A FRESHMAN MEMBER TAKING LEADERSHIP ROLES WHEN IT DEALS WITH BUDGET RECONCILIATION OR SERVING ON MAJOR COMMITTEES AND AND AND UH AND BEING RECOGNIZED FOR PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE ON CERTAIN LEGISLATION ANY OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE ONES THAT'LL BE LOOKED UPON FAVORABLY BY THE ELECTORATE AS TO SOMEBODY WHO IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN CONGRESS 
NOT ALL MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY 
ROLE ON THE CONFERENCE IS A SMALL ONE 
HE'S PART OF A GROUP WORKING OUT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SENATE ON USER FEES ASSESSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION A BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM 
THAT'S A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT IS A FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE 
ANOTHER KEY COG IN THE MACHINE IS THE CONGRESSIONAL AND WHITE HOUSE STAFF 
THEIR WORK CAN BE MUNDANE 
TOM SCULLEY IS A FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL AND A VETERAN OF NEGOTIATIONS THAT LED TO THE NINETEEN NINETY BUDGET AGREEMENT 
IT'S MUCH LESS UH SINISTER AND COSMIC THAN YOU'D EXPECT PEOPLE SIT AROUND TALK ABOUT THE POLICY AND AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME IS SPENT UNFORTUNATELY ON SCORING 
I MEAN WITH THE BASIC TRYING TO MAKE THE NUMBERS WORK OUT THE POLICIES WORK OUT AND THEY'RE ALL INTERACTIVE 
BY SCORING SCULLEY MEANS COMING UP WITH THE ESTIMATES ATTACHED TO VARIOUS REVENUE RAISING AND SPENDING CUTTING PROPOSALS 
THE CONFERENCE LEADERS HOPE TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK 
THEY'RE MAKING SLOW PROGRESS SAID ONE AIDE ADDING AS WE CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN IT'S GOING TO GET STEEPER
