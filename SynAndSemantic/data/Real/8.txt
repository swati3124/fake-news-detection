WHEN VIOLENCE BROKE OUT FOLLOWING THE RODNEY KING VERDICT SAN FRANCISCO WAS ONE OF THE CITIES HIT 
NOW SOME MERCHANTS IN THE CITY BY THE BAY ARE WORRIED IMAGES OF SHATTERED GLASS POLICE IN RIOT GEAR WILL KEEP TOURISTS AT BAY 
CRAIG HEAPS EXPLAINS 
NEAR SAN FRANCISCO'S UNION SQUARE STORE OWNERS WERE TAKING DOWN THE PLYWOOD MONDAY 
IT WAS A FAR CRY FROM THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN LOOTERS THROUGH THE CITY'S UP SCALE SHOPPING AREA SMASHING WINDOWS AND TAKING ANYTHING THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON 
UNION SQUARE IS A FAVORITE AREA FOR TOURISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
BUT SOME FEAR OF THE VIOLENCE WILL DRIVE AWAY VISITORS AND THEIR MONEY 
HOWEVER AT FABRICS DOESN'T SHARE THOSE FEARS 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK 
THEY SHOULD 
WHY IS THAT 
BECAUSE 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY 
PEOPLE ARE NICE 
WHAT HAPPENED THIS LAST FEW DAYS THEY DON'T PRESENT THE LOCAL 
BUT SOME BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY FEELING THE EFFECTS 
AT THE HOTEL NIKKO ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE GUESTS ARE FROM JAPAN 
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE CANCELED RESERVATIONS HERE 
I THINK THAT IT WILL BE A VERY SHORT TERM IN NATURE AND I THINK WE SHOULD SEE A TURN AROUND CERTAINLY IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER DISTURBANCES WITHIN THIRTY DAYS 
TOURISTS SEEM BY LAST WEEK'S DISTURBANCE 
THE VIOLENCE IN ATLANTA IN MY OPINION WAS FAR WORSE THAN IN SAN FRANCISCO 
WHICH DEGREES OF VIOLENCE 
BUT YOU KNOW NOT REALLY 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE U. S. 
IT JUST HAPPENED AND ITS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY AND I'D LOVE TO COME BACK 
MERCHANTS COMPLAINED CITY POLICIES HURT THEM DURING THE RIOT 
FOR APPEARANCE REASONS CITY PLANNERS WON'T LET NEW SHOP OWNERS PUT UP SOLID ROLLING SAFETY DOORS TO KEEP OUT AT NIGHT 
LOOTERS EASILY BROKE THROUGH THE IRON GATES THAT THE CITY ALLOWS 
ON THE OTHER HAND MANY MERCHANTS ARE HAPPY WITH THE POLICE CRACKDOWN FRIDAY NIGHT 
ACTING UNDER THE CITY'S EMERGENCY ORDINANCE OFFICERS BROKE UP A RALLY IN THE CITY'S MISSION DISTRICT EVEN BEFORE IT BEGAN 
THEY ORDERED PEOPLE TO AND ARRESTED THOSE WHO REFUSED 
WE'RE THE ONLY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAD THIS PROBLEM THAT STOPPED IT BROUGHT IT TO A SCREECHING HALT IN ONE DAY 
BUT SOME SAY THE POLICE WENT TOO FAR AND THAT SUSPENDING CIVIL RIGHTS IS TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY FOR PRESERVING CIVIL ORDER
