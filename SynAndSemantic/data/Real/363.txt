IN LIFE JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS PRIVACY 
MONDAY THE FORMER FIRST LADY WAS LAID TO REST IN ONE OF THE MOST VISITED PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES 
MRS. ONASSIS WAS BURIED AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY ALONGSIDE HER ASSASSINATED HUSBAND JOHN F. KENNEDY 
C. N. N.'S BRUCE MORTON LOOKS BACK AT THE DAY THE WORLD SAID ITS FINAL GOODBYES TO A REMARKABLE WOMAN 
THE LAST DAY BEGAN IN NEW YORK INSIDE SAINT LOYOLA CHURCH THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS FROM OVER THE YEARS 
OUTSIDE SEVERAL THOUSAND OTHERS ALSO COME TO SAY GOODBYE 
EDWARD KENNEDY DELIVERED THE EULOGY 
IT WAS A GIFT OF HERSELF THAT SHE GAVE TO OTHERS AND IN SPITE OF ALL OF HER HEARTACHE AND LOSS SHE NEVER FALTERED 
JACKIE WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE A WIDOW IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND TOO YOUNG TO DIE NOW 
LEAVING THE CHURCH PEOPLE APPLAUDED 
THE MASS WAS IN FACT MEANT TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE NOT MOURN HER DEATH 
AND THEN TO WASHINGTON TO ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY 
IF YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH YOU REMEMBERED OTHER MOTORCADES TO ARLINGTON FOR JOHN KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OR ROBERT KENNEDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
AND NOW FOR JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS THOUGH ONASSIS WAS A NAME NOT SPOKEN AT THIS FAMILY FAREWELL 
SHE SEEMED ALWAYS TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE RIGHT WAY 
GOD GAVE HER VERY GREAT GIFTS AND IMPOSED UPON HER GREAT BURDENS 
SHE BORE THEM ALL WITH DIGNITY AND GRACE AND UNCOMMON COMMON SENSE 
IN THE END SHE CARED MOST ABOUT BEING A GOOD MOTHER TO HER CHILDREN AND THE LIVES OF CAROLINE AND JOHN LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WAS THAT AND MORE 
RETIRED ARCHBISHOP PHILLIP HANNAH LED THE SERVICE HE HAD KNOWN THE KENNEDY'S WHEN JOHN WAS PRESIDENT 
AT THE END OF THE SHORT SERVICE THE MICROPHONES WENT SILENT AND HER CHILDREN HAD A CHANCE TO SAY A LAST PRIVATE GOODBYE 
IN HER LIFE SHE PLAYED MANY PARTS 
THE LOVING PARENT THE GLITTERING FIRST LADY WHO MADE ART AND MUSIC WELCOME IN AMERICA'S FIRST HOUSE 
THE COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL THE DEDICATED DEFENDER OF A PRIVATE LIFE 
SHE SAID OF HER HUSBAND THEY MADE HIM A LEGEND HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO BE A MAN 
NOW SHE IS LEGEND TOO 
AND CAMELOT WHATEVER THAT OLD TIME WAS IS HISTORY THE STUFF THAT DREAMS AND MEMORIES ARE MADE OF
