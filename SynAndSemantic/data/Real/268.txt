EVERYONE COULD USE LITTLE HELPERS DURING THE BUSY HOLIDAY SEASON 
ACTUALLY I COULD USE SOME TALL ONES I'VE GOT THAT ARE ALL FULL OF LEAVES 
BUT SANTA CLAUS APPARENTLY IS NO EXCEPTION 
THAT'S RIGHT THE JOLLY OLD MAN HAS A HARD TIME KEEPING UP WITH THE FLOOD OF MAIL FROM HOPEFUL AND OFTEN NEEDY CHILDREN 
C. N. N.'S DON KNAPP DROPS IN ON SOME HELPERS HOPING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
AND SOME OF THESE KIDS HAVE LIKE REALLY EXTENSIVE LISTS 
THEY JUST GO ON FOR PAGES 
LETTERS FROM SANTA ALWAYS GET READ MOSTLY BY HELPERS LIKE PORTLAND 
WITH ALL THE GREED AND ALL THE VIOLENCE YOU WANT TO SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE THESE GENTLE THOUGHTS THESE KIDS' HOPES 
AND OTHER HELPERS GIVE UP A LUNCH HOUR OR PART OF A DAY TO READ LETTERS TO SANTA 
LARGE POST OFFICES WORK WITH COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS TO HELP SANTA WITH HIS MAIL AND CHRISTMAS GIFTS 
SOME LETTERS GET RIGHT TO THE POINT 
PLEASE BRING ME A TEDDY BEAR 
PLEASE DO AS SAY 
OTHERS APOLOGIZE 
I WAS O. K. THIS YEAR BUT I TOLD SOME 
I'M JUST GOING TO ASK FOR A FEW THINGS 
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL IT STRAIGHT WHEN YOU'RE WRITING DIRECTLY TO SANTA 
IF IT LOOKS LIKE A LETTER TO SANTA IT PROBABLY IS 
ABOUT TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIND THEIR WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO'S POST OFFICE 
CHIEF HELPER LORRAINE ALARCON SORTS OUT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THAT SOUND LIKE THEY'RE FROM ESPECIALLY NEEDY CHILDREN 
WE ASK THE PUBLIC TO COME DOWN HERE AND READ THE LETTERS AND CHOOSE THE ONES THEY WANT TO ANSWER EITHER BY PURCHASING A PRESENT OR ANSWERING IT WITH A LETTER 
AND TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE THAT CAN'T GET YOU KNOW NORMAL THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE EVERYDAY NORMAL THINGS AND THEY CAN'T LIKE FOOD AND A CHRISTMAS TREE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
THEY SEND ME A LETTER THAT TELLS ME IF YOU ARE REAL OR IF MY MOM IS SIGNING THE CARDS WITH YOUR NAME ON IT 
SOME LETTERS ARE PRETTY FUNNY 
I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU 
ARE YOU SUPER FAT 
OTHERS PRETTY SERIOUS 
OFTEN THE LETTERS TO SANTA TELL A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THE KIDS THAT WRITE THEM 
THIS LITTLE GIRL WANTS A LONG SKIRT TO KEEP HER WARM AND SOME GIFTS FOR HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
SHE ALSO WANTS SANTA TO GET HER FATHER OUT OF JAIL SO HE CAN COME HOME AND HELP HER MOM WITH THE KIDS 
HELPERS AREN'T ALL CUTE AND CUDDLY ELVES 
HE WAS AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER 
HE TOLD ME HE ACTUALLY DRESSES UP AS SANTA AND DELIVERS THE PRESENTS 
AND HE SAYS HE LOVED IT HE JUST LOVES IT 
YES VIRGINIA THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF HELPERS DOWN AT THE POST OFFICE
