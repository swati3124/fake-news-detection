AND SO THE PRESIDENT COMPLETES IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES HIS SECOND FORMAL NEWS CONFERENCE HERE IN THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE HAVING TRAVELLED MOST OF THE ALPHABET AT LEAST FROM BOSNIA THROUGH WACO WITH A STOP AT STIMULUS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THE QUESTION WAS RAISED DID YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF BOB DOLE 
LET'S FIND OUT ABOUT THE POWER OF BOB DOLE 
THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER WAS LISTENING TO THE PRESIDENT AS HE WAS SPEAKING TODAY 
HE SAID SIR HE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT GET FOUR DEFECTIONS PRESUMABLY FROM YOUR PARTY BEFORE HE GOT DEFEATED IN THE STIMULUS PLAN 
CAN YOU HELP HIM OUT ON THIS 
WELL HE HAD FOUR OR FIVE DEFECTIONS FROM HIS PARTY I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE DEFECTIONS CAME FROM 
I DON'T THINK WE WERE NEVER IN DANGER OF LOSING ANYBODY ON OUR SIDE BECAUSE WE HAD CONSTANT CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER WE WERE TRYING TO RESOLVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE SENATORS JUSTIFIABLY HAD TO SEE IF WE COULD RESOLVE IT AND COULD SETTLE IT IN GOOD FAITH BUT OUR VIEW WAS THAT SENATOR BYRD SORT OF UNDERSCORED LAST NIGHT HE DIDN'T HE NEVER MENTIONED THE WORD COMPROMISE 
THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT TO COMPROMISE 
I THINK THEY GOT THE RESULT THEY WANTED 
WE SAVED THE TAXPAYERS A LOT OF MONEY 
NOW THEY CAN BLAME US IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG 
BOSNIA WE'RE RE ASSESSING AND THE SAME SITUATION PREVAILS IN THAT TROUBLED BALKAN REGION 
ARE YOU AT ONE WITH THE PRESIDENT ON HIS CURRENT BOSNIAN PLAN 
WELL I THINK SO 
I SHARE THE PRESIDENT'S CONCERN IN BOSNIA 
I THINK THE LEAST WE CAN DO UNILATERALLY IS TO LIFT THE ARMS EMBARGO 
I DO I DO THINK WE SHOULD WORK WITH NATO FORCES AND NATO COUNTRIES BEFORE WE START ANY UNILATERAL AIR STRIKES BUT CERTAINLY I WOULD SUPPORT AIR STRIKES 
ALL RIGHT OUR SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WOLF BLITZER HAS BEEN LISTENING AND HE CAN NOW COME IN AND JOIN THIS CONVERSATION 
WOLF 
O. K. SENATOR DOLE I WAS CURIOUS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE AT GREAT LENGTH ABOUT HIS ASSESSMENT HOW HE'S DONE SO FAR DURING HIS FIRST NINETY OR SO DAYS 
NEXT THURSDAY WILL BE DAY ONE HUNDRED 
WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT 
HOW HAS THE PRESIDENT DONE SO FAR 
WELL I'LL GIVE HIM AN E. FOR EFFORT BUT I THINK BEYOND THAT WE'RE GOING TO RESERVE OUR FINAL JUDGMENT UNTIL THE ONE HUNDREDTH DAY 
I JUST THINK THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY THINGS COMING AT US IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED DAYS 
EVERY DAY IS SOME KIND OF A NEW SPENDING PROGRAM OR A NEW KIND OF A TAX AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A BIT NOW ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON REALLY HAS IN MIND FOR THEM 
IF HE DOES GO FORWARD NEXT WEEK OR IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOW WITH SOME SORT OF NEW POLICY TOWARDS BOSNIA LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO OR PERHAPS EVEN THESE AIR STRIKES WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT 
AND WOULD CONGRESS GO ALONG WITH THAT KIND OF DRAMATIC CHANGE IN POLICY 
WELL I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY PARTY BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS NOT A PARTY VIEW BUT I WOULD SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IN THAT EFFORT 
I THINK THE LONGER HE WAITS THE MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'VE WAITED TOO LONG 
WE WAITED TOO LONG IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION LET'S DON'T WAIT TOO LONG IN THIS ADMINISTRATION 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS OTHER QUESTION THOUGH IN THIS WHOLE CONNECTION WITH BOSNIA 
THE PENTAGON SEEMS TO BE REAL NERVOUS ABOUT STEPPING UP ANY KIND OF MILITARY INVOLVEMENT 
HOW DO YOU GET OVER THAT HURDLE IF GENERAL POWELL AND OTHER MILITARY PLANNERS SAY IT'S A BAD IDEA SIMPLY GOING TO DRAW THE UNITED STATES INTO A CONFLICT THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED IN 
WELL I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS THE PENTAGON POLICY IS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S DOABLE 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN SOMALIA IT'S DOABLE 
BUT I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IN BOSNIA CAN WE GO IN AND DO IT 
NOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT INJECTING GROUND FORCES AT LEAST I'M NOT AND NEITHER IS PRESIDENT CLINTON BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL JUDGMENT TO EITHER DO SOMETHING NOW OR DO IT LATER WHEN THE SERBS MOVE INTO WHERE YOU HAVE TWO MILLION ALBANIANS AND WHERE YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL THERE OF DRAGGING IN OTHER COUNTRIES GREECE AND TURKEY AND MACEDONIA BULGARIA ALBANIA 
SOONER OR LATER IT'S WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME MOVE SO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME WE NEED TO SEND MILOSEVIC A MESSAGE HE CANNOT MISUNDERSTAND 
SENATOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WACO AND THE CONDITION OF YOUR WILLIAM SESSIONS YOUR PARTY'S NOMINEE AND DIRECTOR OF THE F. B. I. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THE F. B. I.'S ACTIONS REQUIRED IN WACO 
WERE THEY CORRECT AND WERE THOSE OF THE A. T. F. BEFORE THEM PROPER ALSO 
WELL YOU KNOW MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING IS A PRETTY STABLE COMMODITY AROUND THIS TOWN 
I'D RATHER WAIT UNTIL WE HAD SOME OBJECTIVE HEARINGS 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE HEARINGS BOTH IN THE SENATE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE WHICH I'M A MEMBER AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
I THINK WE HAVE SOME HARD QUESTIONS TO ASK THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WHY CERTAIN THINGS WERE DONE WHY IT WAS NECESSARY IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS TO EXPOSE PEOPLE WHO DID LOSE THEIR LIVES 
SO BUT UNTIL THAT TIME I THINK WE OUGHT TO WITHHOLD JUDGMENT 
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF CALLS I MUST SAY CALLS FROM MY STATE RAISING CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
MR. CONDITION AS DIRECTOR HAD ALREADY BEEN IMPERILED SOMEWHAT BY SOME OTHER INTERNAL REPORTS THAT WERE NOT TOO PLEASED WITH THE ACTIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WITH RESPECT TO PERKS 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE SHOULD FINALLY BE OH SHOULD WE SAY SACRIFICED ON THE ALTAR OF THE BRANCH DAVIDIANS 
WELL I DON'T BELIEVE SO BUT AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT 
PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID HE'S WAITING ON A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT I ASSUME JANET RENO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT BEYOND THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY INSIDE INFORMATION 
I'VE READ THE STORIES I'VE READ THE ALLEGATIONS 
I'VE ALSO READ WHAT MR. SESSIONS HAD TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO THAT 
NO VISITS WITH HIM BUT IT SEEMS I JUST FEEL ON BALANCE HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB 
SENATOR DOLE THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE'S GOING TO BE OUT OF TOWN THIS WEEKEND WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THE DEMONSTRATION ON BEHALF OF GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE OUT OF TOWN 
DO YOU THINK REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING WHAT THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBES AS AN END OF DISCRIMINATION OF THESE AMERICANS 
WELL NOBODY WANTS DISCRIMINATION REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS 
I THINK BOTH THE SENATE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF TOWN NOT BECAUSE OF THIS BUT BECAUSE OF LONG PLANNED CONFERENCES WE HAVE IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO JAMESTOWN VIRGINIA SO WE'LL BE OUT OF TOWN BUT NOT BECAUSE OF THIS PARTICULAR EVENT 
CERTAINLY WE ALL DISCRIMINATION BUT WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENCES ON WHAT DISCRIMINATION IS 
IS THE PRESIDENT HANDLING THIS ISSUE PROPERLY IN YOUR OPINION 
IS THERE MORE OR LESS HE SHOULD BE DOING 
WELL THAT'S A JUDGMENT CALL FOR HIM 
I THINK HE'S DOING MORE THAN HE SHOULD BE DOING AND I THINK PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO GAYS IN THE MILITARY I THINK HE MADE A BIG MISTAKE THERE 
THAT WAS ONE MISTAKE HE MADE IN HIS FIRST ONE HUNDRED DAYS 
BUT IN ANY EVENT HE'S MADE THIS JUDGMENT THEY WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HIM IN THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THEY NOW HAVE AN AUDIENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND AGAIN I DON'T SUGGEST ANYBODY SHOULD BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN AMERICA AND IF THERE ARE CERTAIN FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION THAT THEY SUFFER FROM I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF IT 
MR. DOLE IT WAS SAID THAT THE LATEST FLAP OVER THE DOCUMENTATION THAT MORE AMERICANS MIGHT HAVE BEEN HELD P. O. W. THAN WERE ADMITTED TO BY HANOI AT LEAST THIS HAS NOW DRAWN HANOI INTO A MORE FORTHCOMING POSITION 
THEY'VE GIVEN GENERAL SOME MORE DOCUMENTS 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS SITUATION IN WHICH MORE DOCUMENTS SEEM YET TO COME 
WELL IN MY VIEW THEY ALWAYS GIVE US A LITTLE MORE WHEN WE GET NEAR THE SMOKING GUN AND I WOULDN'T BE IN ANY HURRY IN FACT I WOULD OPPOSE ANY NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM AT THIS TIME 
I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS TO GIVE US DOCUMENTS AND NOW THEY'RE DOING IT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS LATER 
WE'VE HAD FAMILIES SUFFER FOR ALL THAT TIME NOT KNOWING WHAT THE PRECISE FACTS WERE ABOUT THEIR THEIRS SONS OR THEIR HUSBANDS OR THEIR FATHERS BROTHERS WHATEVER AND I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S NOT A TIME TO DISCUSS NORMALIZATION OR WITH NORTH VIETNAM WITH VIETNAM AT ALL 
WHAT IS THE SMOKING GUN 
WELL I MEAN THERE'S A SMOKING GUN I DON'T KNOW IF THE SMOKING A RUSSIAN DOCUMENT OR NOT BUT YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE GET CLOSE TO SOMETHING THAT MIGHT OR SOMEBODY REVEALS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON NORMALIZING RELATIONS THEN THEY COME UP WITH ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS 
IF THEY'VE GOT ANY MORE DOCUMENTS WHATEVER THEY HAVE OUGHT TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO US SO WE CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT MADE ON EVERYTHING NOT JUST WAIT FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO HAPPEN AND SAY OH BY THE WAY HERE'S ANOTHER DOCUMENT 
MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER 
SENATOR AM I HEARING SOME IMPLIED CRITICISM OF GENERAL WHO SEEMS TO SUGGEST YES THAT DOCUMENT IS AUTHENTIC 
NO NO 
BUT THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS IS INACCURATE 
NO MY CRITICISM IS THE VIETNAM NORTH VIETNAMESE 
I MEAN I THINK THEY GAVE GENERAL THE DOCUMENT ONLY AFTER THE RUSSIAN DOCUMENT THEN UNCOVERED SO NO I DON'T QUARREL WITH GENERAL 
I THINK HE'S A PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID HE'S AN OUTSTANDING AMERICAN HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB PUBLIC SERVICE RIGHT NOW I APPLAUD HIM FOR IT 
NO I DON'T FAULT HIM I JUST FAULT THE VIETNAMESE 
WHAT ABOUT THE REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED TODAY BY THE PENTAGON ON THE TAILHOOK INVESTIGATION 
YOUR THOUGHTS 
IS IT TIME FOR THE SENIOR COMMAND IN THE NAVY AND THE MARINE CORPS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS 
ARE THEY GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS 
HAS THERE BEEN A COVERUP 
I THINK THEY WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT NOW 
I THINK EARLY ON THEY DID NOT AND I THINK NOW THEY UNDERSTAND 
THEY'RE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE AND IF THEY NEED NUDGING FROM CONGRESS IT WILL COME 
AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD SUGGEST THE NAMES SHOULD BE RELEASED BUT I WOULDN'T RELEASE NAMES PREMATURELY AND PERMANENTLY DAMAGE SOMEBODY'S REPUTATION WHO MAY LATER BE PROVEN TO BE INNOCENT 
SENATOR SOMEWHERE IN THIS NEXT ONE HUNDRED DAYS HEALTH CARE AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT HAS GOT TO BECOME I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY CAN SURVIVE ANOTHER GO ROUND AS WE DID ON THE STIMULUS PACKAGE 
AND RATE THIS COMING WAR IN COMPARISON WITH THE LITTLE DUST UP WE'VE JUST HAD 
WELL IT WAS A LITTLE DUST UP I CALL IT A BUMP IN THE ROAD OF THIS SO CALLED STIMULUS PACKAGE BUT IT THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN OUR PARTY PHILOSOPHY PRESIDENT CLINTON LIKES DEFICIT SPENDING HE LIKES TAXES 
WE DON'T THINK MOST AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM AND WE THINK THAT'S WHY HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE DROPPING AND WHY PEOPLE ARE SAYING NOW THAT IN HIS ECONOMIC PLAN SIXTY THREE PERCENT SAY THERE ARE TOO MANY TOO MANY TAXES 
HEALTH CARE IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER THIRTY DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE AND I MUST SAY IF YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AS SOME OF US HAVE DONE THERE'S A LOT OF NERVOUSNESS OUT THERE 
PEOPLE ARE NOT CERTAIN WHETHER THEY OUGHT TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS HIRE MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE PRESIDENT CLINTON IS GOING TO TAKE US TAKE US AS A COUNTRY AND TAKE THEM IN THEIR BUSINESS 
SO I JUST THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE SLOWDOWN A COUPLE OF FORTY HOUR WEEKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND GIVE EVERYBODY TIME TO CATCH THEIR BREATH AND THE PRESIDENT TIME TO FOCUS ON HIS PRIORITIES NOT EVERY DAY HAVE SOME NEW PROGRAM THAT COSTS A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OR SOME NEW TAX LIKE THE VALUE ADDED TAX FLOATED AROUND 
IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY OF THIS COUNTRY 
SENATOR WOULD IT BE HELPFUL TO COMBINE WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE BURGEONING INQUIRIES INTO WACO INTO ONE HEARING OF SOME SORT SOMEPLACE 
THAT ALWAYS MAKES SENSE 
IT RARELY HAPPENS BUT CERTAINLY YES WE'D HAVE ONE HEARING INSTEAD OF FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX WE'LL PROBABLY END UP WITH BEFORE IT'S OVER 
ONE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER 
AND DOES THIS BECOME ULTIMATELY A POLITICAL ISSUE OR DOES IT BECOME A MORAL NATIONAL QUESTION 
I THINK IT'S A MORAL NATIONAL IT'S NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE IN THE SENSE THAT SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO BLAME SOMEONE AND THAT WOULD BE HARD TO DO WHERE YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS INVESTING A DEMOCRATIC YOU KNOW ADMINISTRATION 
IF THEY DID IT LIKE THEY DID INVESTIGATING REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS I WOULD SAY IT WAS POLITICAL 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE POLITICAL WHEN THEY'RE CHECKING THEIR OWN BUT WE DO DESERVE TO HAVE THE HEARING 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED THE ANSWERS AND I THINK THEY'LL COME 
SENATOR ROBERT DOLE OF KANSAS THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR OPINIONS ON WHAT HAS BEEN A PRESS CONFERENCE FROM THE EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE CONDUCTED BY PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON HIS SECOND IN THIS FIRST ONE HUNDRED DAYS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION
