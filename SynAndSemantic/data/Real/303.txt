THE SENATE DEALS WITH A TURBULENT WEEK 
I'M ROWLAND EVANS 
ROBERT NOVAK AND I WILL TAKE A LOOK AT A TURBULENT WEEK IN THE SENATE BY QUESTIONING THE REPUBLICAN LEADER 
HE IS SENATOR ROBERT DOLE OF KANSAS 
THIS WEEK THE SENATE BEGAN AN HISTORIC DEBATE ON THE BALANCED AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION WITH DEMOCRAT PITTED AGAINST DEMOCRAT 
WHAT WE ARE DOING TO FUTURE GENERATIONS WITH THIS BURDEN THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM THAT REALLY IS TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
NOT ONE THIN DIME IN TAXES DOES IT RAISE NOR DOES IT CUT ONE COPPER PENNY OUT OF ANY PROGRAM 
HOW EASY 
WHY HADN'T I THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE 
MY WHAT A GREAT IDEA THIS IS 
BUT THIS WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THE EXPOSURE OF A HIGH LEVEL C. I. A. OFFICIAL SPYING FOR THE RUSSIANS 
AS THE CO AUTHOR OF THE RUSSIAN AID BILL LAST YEAR AND SOMEBODY WHO SUPPORTS FOREIGN AID AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION I CAN TELL YOU THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR FOREIGN AID IS CLEARLY IN DOUBT AS IT RELATES TO RUSSIA 
CAUGHT UP IN THE FUROR WAS THE NOMINATION OF STROBE TALBOTT AS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THIRTY ONE VOTES CAST AGAINST HIS CONFIRMATION 
MR. TALBOTT WAS SOFT ON THE FORMER SOVIET UNION TOUTING ITS LEGITIMACY WHILE THIS NATION'S LEGITIMACY 
WE'RE ATTENDING AN ECONOMIC CONFERENCE IN BOCA RATON FLORIDA 
SENATOR DOLE SINCE YOU AND MANY OF THE REPUBLICANS TALK ABOUT SUSPENDING AID TO THE RUSSIANS HOW LONG WOULD YOU SUSPEND THE AID BECAUSE OF THIS SPY INCIDENT 
WELL I THINK WE MADE A LITTLE PROGRESS WITH THE PRESIDENT EXPELLING AT LEAST ONE RUSSIAN 
HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IMMEDIATELY 
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW REASSESS OUR RELATIONS WITH BORIS YELTSIN AND WITH RUSSIA 
I THINK WE'VE GIVEN RUSSIA THROUGH STROBE TALBOTT HERE TOO MUCH LEEWAY 
THEY DECIDE WHAT OUR POLICY IS IN BOSNIA 
THEY DECIDE WHO CAN JOIN NATO 
YOU KNOW MY VIEW IS WE WANT TO SUPPORT YELTSIN BUT I THINK WE OUGHT TO SUSPEND IT FOR A WHILE SO THEY'LL UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THIS SPYING CHARGE IS 
WELL WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET THE AID BACK IF YOUR POLICY WAS FOLLOWED 
BECAUSE THE AIDE WAS KICKED OUT 
THEY WE HAD ASKED THEM TO THE RUSSIANS TO PULL HIM BACK VOLUNTARILY 
THEY REFUSED 
DO YOU THINK THEIR REACTION HAS BEEN ADEQUATE TO THE AMOUNT TO THE OFFENSE 
NUMBER 
AND I THINK PROBABLY MORE OUGHT TO BE EXPELLED AND I THINK THERE OUGHT YOU KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF OUR AGENTS THERE WHO WERE EXECUTED TRIED AND EXECUTED OVER THE YEARS 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FOR CERTAIN 
BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY SERIOUS BREACH PROBABLY THE MOST SERIOUS BREACH IN A LONG LONG TIME RIGHT IN THE C. I. A. 
SO IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
AND I'LL TELL YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE GIVE AID ON THE ONE HAND AND ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN ON THE OTHER 
THEY THOUGHT WE HAD A NEW RELATIONSHIP 
NOW UNLESS BORIS YELTSIN DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS HAPPENING THEN I THINK WELL WE JUST SUSPEND THE AID FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE BUT I THINK IT WOULD SEND AT LEAST A STRONG MESSAGE 
WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU HEAR COMING FROM MOSCOW AND NOW YOU HEAR COMING FROM WASHINGTON THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENTS IN RUSSIA 
WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING 
WE CAN'T REALLY SCREAM BLOODY MURDER OVER HAVING THAT THEY HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL CLONE IN THE C. I. A. 
WELL I THINK 
MOLE IN THE C. I. A. I'M SORRY 
WE MAY BE A BIT NAIVE OURSELVES 
THERE ARE PROBABLY YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW THE C. I. A. HOW ALL THIS HAPPENED AND HE WASN'T DISCOVERED 
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR OVERSIGHT 
BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS ON THE INSIDE 
IT LASTED OVER SIX YEARS 
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED 
IF THEY FIND ONE OF OURS O. K. THEY CAN TAKE WHATEVER ACTION THEY WANT 
BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS CASE THAT OUGHT TO BE DEALT WITH AND IT OUGHT TO BE DEALT WITH VERY QUICKLY 
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE TO USE NOT ONLY MILD PROTEST BUT TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IN THE MEANTIME SUSPEND AID 
I KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO 
HE MET THIS MORNING MET JUST A DAY OR TWO AGO AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO CUT OFF AID 
THEY DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT RELATIONS 
AGAIN I THINK THIS MAY BE MR. INFLUENCE 
I'M GOING TO GET TO MR. TALBOTT IN A MINUTE 
BUT MR. LEADER BE SPECIFIC 
YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD EXPEL MORE 
HOW MANY MORE 
OH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE 
HOW MANY MAY HAVE HAD CONTACT 
ONE 
I THINK IT'S UP TO HIM TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT 
BUT YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS 
WELL AT LEAST IT'S A MODEST START 
I THINK IT'S BEEN CALLED A MODEST START 
EVEN 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH 
BUT EVEN THEN HE WAITED TO GIVE THE RUSSIANS A CHANCE TO DO IT VOLUNTARILY 
SO IT'S YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT YELTSIN TO FAIL 
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME 
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND TOO THAT WE HAVE SOME INTERESTS AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO PRESERVE OUR INTERESTS FIRST 
NOW BE SPECIFIC ON THE AID SIR IF I MAY ASK YOU 
HOW LONG SHOULD THAT SUSPENSION LAST 
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY DO 
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S SAYING WELL WE CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE MOST OF THE AID IS TO DISMANTLE ALL THESE WARHEADS 
THEY HAVEN'T DISMANTLED A SINGLE WARHEAD YET 
SO I DON'T ONLY ABOUT ONE TENTH OF THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT AND NOT A SINGLE BEEN DISMANTLED 
BUT SO YOU DON'T HAVE A TIME FRAME ON SPENDING IT 
I DON'T HAVE A TIME FRAME 
NOW ON STROBE TALBOTT IT WAS AMAZING TO ME AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS IN WASHINGTON FOR FORTY FIVE FIFTY YEARS 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIRTY ONE VOTES AGAINST SOMEBODY FOR BASICALLY A NONPARTISAN POSITION LIKE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE 
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH STROBE TALBOTT 
IS THIS JUST RANK PARTISANSHIP ON THE PART OF THE REPUBLICANS 
I DON'T BELIEVE SO 
I DON'T BELIEVE SO 
IN FACT I THINK I SAID IN MY STATEMENT I FIRST THOUGHT I'D VOTE FOR HIM IN TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE 
THEN I THINK I THOUGHT I'D VOTE AGAINST HIM TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT MAYBE HE'S HAD ENOUGH PROMOTIONS 
IF HE SHOULD BE ELEVATED ONE MORE TIME HE'D BE SECRETARY OF STATE 
AND I DON'T THINK HE MIGHT GET THE VOTES 
I'M NOT CERTAIN THEY COULD SHUT OFF A FILIBUSTER IN THAT EVENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIS NOMINATION SAID OH WELL IF HE GOES ANY HIGHER THEN WE'LL TAKE A LOOK 
AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF HIS WRITINGS HIS ATTITUDE OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS 
HE SIDED WITH THE DOVES ALL THROUGH THE COLD WAR 
HE CRITICIZED RONALD REAGAN 
AND THEN AFTER YOU KNOW ALL THESE POLICIES PAID OFF GETTING TOUGH BUILDING UP OUR DEFENSE THEN HE SAID THE DOVES HAD BEEN RIGHT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
WELL SPECIFICALLY MR. LEADER WOULD YOU SAY THIS WAS A SHOT ACROSS BILL CLINTON'S BOW BEARING THE MESSAGE DO NOT NOMINATE THIS MAN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE HE WON'T BE CONFIRMED 
I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE A PRETTY CLEAR MESSAGE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAS IN MIND 
I UNDERSTAND I WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS PAST WEEK AND THEY SAID IT DIDN'T START THERE 
THERE WASN'T ANY RUMORS AT THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT HIM GOING UP 
BUT 
WELL THEY'RE ALL OVER TOWN 
WELL THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE AT LEAST ON THE HILL 
SENATOR DOLE YOU KNOW THE SENIOR OFFICIALS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT FEEL THIS WAS PURE PARTISANSHIP 
REALLY 
YES 
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT FROM THEM 
HAVE THEY SAID THAT TO YOU 
NUMBER 
IN FACT WE GOT CALLS 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD ABOUT TEN VOTES AGAINST HIM 
AND I MUST SAY I THINK OUR POLICY LUNCHEON MAYBE STIRRED UP ANOTHER FIFTEEN OR TWENTY 
WE'VE LET MOST OF CLINTON'S NOMINEES GO THROUGH 
MAYBE WE HAVEN'T FOUGHT AS HARD AS WE SHOULD 
BUT WE WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE 
AGAIN IT'S ON I THINK ON THE RUSSIAN POLICY TOO BECAUSE STROBE BEEN ALWAYS THE ONE OVER ALL THE YEARS BE NICE TO RUSSIA 
BE NICE TO RUSSIA 
BE NICE TO RUSSIA 
WELL WE'VE BEEN VERY NICE TO RUSSIA 
IN FACT WE'VE LET THEM IN EFFECT VETO SOME OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO DO THIS PAST YEAR 
AND WE THINK IT'S MR. INFLUENCE ON EXPANDING NATO FOR EXAMPLE ON BOSNIA ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SERBS 
SO IT'S NOT PARTISANSHIP BUT I HOPE IT SENT A STRONG MESSAGE 
DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS THANKS TO THE RUSSIAN INTERVENTION THAT WE DON'T HAVE AMERICAN AIRMEN TONIGHT TODAY FLYING IN HARM'S WAY IN BOSNIA THAT THEY HAVE PREVENTED IT 
I'M NOT CERTAIN IT'S THANKS TO THE RUSSIANS 
I THINK THEY MOVED IN AGAIN TO GIVE THE ADVANTAGE TO THE SERBS 
AND THE SERBS CERTAINLY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE 
YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TURN THEIR GUNS IN 
THEY REMOVED THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
THEY CAN USE THEIR GUNS SOMEWHERE ELSE WHILE THE MUSLIMS HAD TO TURN THEIRS IN 
SO I THINK THERE'S A CLOSE CONNECTION OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE SERBS HAS BEEN FOR A LONG LONG TIME 
BUT AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE RUSSIANS INTEND TO LEAVE WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO 
IT MAY BE HELPFUL IN THE PROCESS 
I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT 
DO YOU 
ON THE QUESTION I'M SORRY 
ALL RIGHT 
ON THE QUESTION OF BOSNIA SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER IS TALKING ABOUT SENDING STILL IF THERE IS A DEAL MADE SENDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AMERICAN TROOPS OR A SIMILAR NUMBER TO BOSNIA 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT IF IT COMES THROUGH 
TO KEEP THE PEACE 
TO KEEP THE PEACE 
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT 
YOU'RE TALKING PEACEKEEPERS PEACEMAKERS 
THESE ARE PEACEKEEPERS RIGHT 
THEY'RE GOING TO 
PEACEKEEPERS 
PEACE IS GOING TO BE MADE 
WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE PEACE 
IF WE HAVE THIS FEDERATION YOU KNOW WITH CROATIA AND BOSNIA THAT MIGHT MAKE IT YOU KNOW A MORE VIABLE STATE 
IF THAT HAPPENS IT MIGHT BE 
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE IT'S PRETTY WE TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER SILAJDZIC JUST A FEW DAYS AGO THAT MANY OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO'VE BEEN SUPPORTING HIM EVEN ON AIRSTRIKES LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO WERE A LITTLE QUEASY ABOUT SENDING AMERICAN TROOPS THERE EVEN AFTER A PEACE AGREEMENT'S SIGNED IF IT'S ONE THAT'S IMPOSED ON BOSNIA 
WELL IF HE COMES TO YOU MR. LEADER AS HE SAID HE WILL FOR AUTHORITY TO SEND PEACEKEEPING TROOPS WOULD THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE APPROVE OF THAT DO YOU THINK AS OF TODAY 
WHAT WOULD YOUR 
NOT AS OF TODAY 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT 
THEY WOULD NOT 
THE PRESIDENT'S GOT TO UNDERSTAND HE'S THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND HE'S GOT TO PREPARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HE'S GOT TO GO TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT HIM 
YEAH BUT HE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL 
CAN HE OR CAN'T HE 
HE COULD 
BUT IF I WERE HIM I WOULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT CONGRESS 
SO HE WOULDN'T 
NOW THERE'S A DIRTY RUMOR AROUND TOWN THAT THE RUSSIANS STEPPED INTO BOSNIA FOR MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH WAS TO ESTABLISH THEIR CREDENTIALS AS PEACEKEEPERS AND THAT THEY WANT THAT TO USE OVER THE WHOLE AREA OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION 
WOULD YOU APPROVE OR SHOULD THE UNITED STATES APPROVE RUSSIA BEING IN EFFECT A U. N. AGENT FOR PEACEKEEPING IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION 
I WOULDN'T THINK SO 
AND AGAIN I THINK THIS AGAIN I WOULDN'T LAY IT DIRECTLY AT STROBE FEET BUT HE'S TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE YOU KNOW GEORGIA WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE THAT MAYBE THAT THAT MAYBE RUSSIA HAD A RIGHT OR AN INTEREST AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROCEED WITH THAT 
BUT I DON'T THINK SO 
YOU THINK THAT YELTSIN HAS THIS IN MIND THAT HE WANTS 
I DON'T KNOW 
TO GET US OUT OF HIS HAIR IN REESTABLISHING THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE THE EMPIRE WITHOUT COMMUNISM 
I KNOW THE I DON'T KNOW THAT 
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YELTSIN HAS 
HE HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS 
EVERY DAY HE'S GOT A NEW ONE 
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S THE LAST THING HE NEEDS TO BE LOOKING AT 
HE HAS TROOPS NOW IN BOSNIA SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
ON FRIDAY THERE WAS A HORRIBLE INCIDENT WHERE AN ISRAELI COMMITTED A MASSACRE IN A MOSQUE IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES HEAVY ONE OF THE HEAVIEST DEATH TOLLS EVER 
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE P. L. O. ISRAELI PEACE NEGOTIATIONS 
NO DOUBT IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT I WANT TO GIVE PRESIDENT CLINTON CREDIT HERE FOR MOVING VERY QUICKLY IN INVITING RABIN AND ARAFAT TO COME TO WASHINGTON 
I THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
IT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE HAVE U. S. LEADERSHIP 
AND THAT MAY PREVENT IT 
IT MAY IN FACT THIS TRAGIC INCIDENT MAY SPUR PEACE 
WE DON'T KNOW YET BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE NEXT THING IS GOING TO BE TRYING TO DISARM THE SETTLERS AND ALL THAT 
I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU 
THE P. L. O. IS DEMANDING THAT THE SETTLERS BE DISARMED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF IT 
I'M NOT CERTAIN 
I THINK THE P. L. O. HAS COMMITTED SOME ATROCITIES TOO 
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO SORT OF EVEN I THINK WHAT WE NEED WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST WHAT THIS HAS DONE JUST LIKE WHAT HAPPENED FEBRUARY FIFTH IN SARAJEVO WHEN YOU HAD SIXTY SEVEN INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED IT MAY SPUR THE EFFORT TO GET THE MIDEAST PEACE THING DONE 
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE PEACE THERE IN THE WEST BANK WITH ALL THOSE SETTLEMENTS LEFT INTACT SENATOR 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT 
WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD LEND ITS WEIGHT TOWARD REDUCING HELPING PERSUADE ISRAEL TO REDUCE SOME OF THOSE SETTLEMENTS 
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT YES 
BUT AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO BE UP TO PRESIDENT CLINTON 
I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY'RE COMING TO WASHINGTON GOING TO PROVIDE SOME U. S. LEADERSHIP HOPEFULLY SOME COUNSEL WE'VE GOT TO GET BRING THIS THING TO A CONCLUSION 
I DON'T THINK IT CAN DRAG ON MUCH LONGER OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE INCIDENTS LIKE WE HAD 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS LEAD MONTHS AGO AND BROUGHT THOSE TALKS RIGHT HERE AFTER THE GREAT CELEBRATION ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN SEPTEMBER THIRTEENTH 
I DON'T WANT TO SECOND GUESS THE PRESIDENT 
WELL NO SECOND GUESS HIM 
NUMBER 
I THINK THEY'VE BEEN MAKING CERTAIN OVERTURES THERE 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP IT TOGETHER 
BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
PUT IT THAT WAY 
SENATOR DOLE THE DEBATE IN THE SENATE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO END UP IN ANOTHER DEFEAT FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FAILURE TO GET THE NECESSARY TWO THIRDS MAJORITY 
IS THAT YOUR ASSESSMENT 
IT'S VERY CLOSE 
WHAT WOULD YOU GUESS 
BUT I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE THE DEMOCRATS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY THEY'RE GOING TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE SO EVERYBODY LIKE SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND SENATOR REID AND OTHERS CAN VOTE FOR THEIR SUBSTITUTE AND VOTE AGAINST THE SIMON CRAIG AMENDMENT 
SO I THINK THEY'VE GOT IT WORKED OUT SO THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO LOSE 
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT THIS IS EVER GOING TO BE PASSED 
I MEAN THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT I KNOW OF 
AND IT NEVER GETS ANYWHERE 
IT'LL PASS WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TAKE OVER THE SENATE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY MISGIVINGS THAT SENATOR PAUL SIMON DEMOCRAT OF ILLINOIS THE SPONSOR OF IT IS A SPONSOR OF SO MUCH ADDITIONAL SPENDING LEGISLATION AND YOU SAY HOW DO YOU HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET 
WELL YOU GET MORE REVENUE 
YOU GET MORE TAXES 
I THINK HE WAS LISTED AS THE THIRD HIGHEST SPENDER HERE IN SOME SURVEY LAST IT BOTHERS ME SOME 
IN FACT WHAT BOTHERS ME EVEN MORE I OFFERED AN AMENDMENT TO PAY FOR THE EARTHQUAKE 
WE WANTED TO HELP THE EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA 
WHY NOT PAY FOR IT 
I GOT FORTY THREE VOTES 
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED AGAINST ME ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT 
SO THERE IS A LITTLE I DON'T SUGGEST SENATOR SIMON BECAUSE HE'S REALLY MADE A COMMITMENT TO DO THIS BUT THERE ARE SOME THERE WHO I THINK ARE 
BUT IT MIGHT MEAN HIGHER TAXES WON'T IT 
IT COULD MEAN HIGHER TAXES 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
WE DON'T HAVE THE TAX LIMIT 
THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S MISSING IN THIS 
WE DON'T HAVE THE SIXTY VOTES FOR TAXES 
YOU COULD STILL HAVE A TAX INCREASE WITH FIFTY ONE VOTES 
SENATOR I WANT TO GO BACK FOR ONE MOMENT TO THE OVERALL FOREIGN POLICY QUESTION WITH THIS PRESIDENT 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM OF HIM 
YOU HAVE SAID YOU SAID ON MEET THE PRESS TWO WEEKS AGO I'M TRYING TO SUPPORT HIM 
DO YOU THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT IS VULNERABLE ON THE WHOLE POST COLD WAR POLICY TOWARD RUSSIA AND EUROPE 
WELL IN MY VIEW I THINK HE IS 
AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING MORE REPUBLICAN I DON'T SAY ATTACKS BUT MORE REPUBLICAN CRITICISM 
YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN AROUND THERE FOR A LONG TIME 
THEY TALK ABOUT INSPECTIONS 
THEY WON'T LET US INSPECT TWO SITES 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE BOMB OR NOT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW MORE CARROTS FOR NORTH KOREA 
WHETHER IT'S BOSNIA WHETHER IT'S THE MIDEAST WHETHER IT'S HAITI WHETHER IT'S SOMALIA THERE ISN'T ANY COHESIVE FOREIGN POLICY 
WHAT MARK DO YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT A B. C. D. OR E. 
ON FOREIGN POLICY 
YES SIR 
ABOUT A C. MINUS 
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN AWFULLY PARTISAN SENATOR THIS YEAR 
I MEAN 
I DON'T THINK SO 
WHEN YOU CRITICIZE HIM ON FOREIGN POLICY IS THAT DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE IMAGE OF THE PARTY TAKING THAT POSITION 
I DON'T BELIEVE SO BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE 
WE HELPED THE PRESIDENT ON BOSNIA 
IN FACT I SUPPORTED WHAT HE SAID IN HIS CAMPAIGN 
I EVEN WENT AS FAR AS AIRSTRIKES 
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES DON'T DO THAT 
SENATOR HELMS WHO WAS ON YOUR PROGRAM SAID I THINK BOB MIGHT BE MAKING A MISTAKE 
SO I WAS OUT THERE ON A LIMB SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT ON LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO TRYING TO HELP HIM 
WE HELPED HIM WITH SOMALIA 
WE WORKED OUT A COMPROMISE 
WE CAN'T HELP MUCH IN HAITI BECAUSE SO I THINK OVERALL FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD BE NONPARTISAN 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK 
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NAMING A VACANCY ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MAYBE TWO ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HIM 
WELL I THINK BLINDER IS IN LINE FOR ONE 
I HOPE THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE FILLED WITH A BLACK OR AN HISPANIC AND THERE ARE SOME GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE 
HAVE YOU GOT A NAME 
WELL A FELLOW NAMED BOB WILSON LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
SENATOR WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK 
AND WHEN WE COME BACK WITH THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER WE WILL HAVE THE BIG QUESTION FOR BOB DOLE 
THE BIG QUESTION FOR SENATOR DOLE 
EVERYBODY SAYS CLINTON'S HEALTH REFORM PROGRAM AS WRITTEN IS FINISHED 
HE SAYS IT'S ALL NEGOTIABLE GENTLEMEN 
ALL I INSIST ON UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
WILL HE GET UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
WELL HE MAY GET A GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
THAT WOULD YOU MIGHT MEET IT IF YOU COULD SAVE THE MONEY 
BUT THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF THE WAGON ON THE CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN 
AND I'LL MAKE A PREDICTION I KNOW YOU MAKE PREDICTIONS ON THIS PROGRAM 
YEAH VERY MUCH SO 
MANDATORY ALLIANCES ARE DEAD EMPLOYER MANDATES ARE DEAD AND PRICE CONTROLS ARE DEAD 
NOW THOSE THREE ARE SORT OF THE OF HIS WHOLE PROGRAM AND I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ENOUGH VOTES EVEN AMONG DEMOCRATS TO PASS ANY OF THOSE THREE 
WELL WHEN YOU WERE AT THE SENATE AT WHITE HOUSE FOR DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON THEY ASKED ALL THE REPUBLICANS THERE IF YOU WOULD GUARANTEE THEM UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
WHAT DID YOU SAY 
WE SAID IT WOULD BE A GOAL 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS A GOAL 
IS THAT A NO 
THAT'S HOW DO YOU DO IT 
WELL YOU DON'T DO IT BY 
YOU CAN'T DO IT IF YOU 
YOU DON'T DO IT IN THE BILL FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
IT CANNOT BE 
WELL WE DON'T DO IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS 
WE DON'T DO IT IN ANY OF OUR BILLS UNTIL WE SAVE THE MONEY 
YOU DON'T GO OUT 
BUT CLINTON WANTS IT RIGHT AWAY 
THEY DON'T HAVE IT IN HAWAII AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING FOR TWENTY YEARS 
THEY ONLY HAVE NINETY FOUR PERCENT COVERAGE 
WILL THAT SATISFY THE PRESIDENT WHAT YOU SAID AS A GOAL 
I THINK SO 
YOU THINK IT'LL SATISFY HIM 
I THINK SO 
WHAT WOULD YOUR DATE BE 
WE DON'T HAVE A DATE 
WE HAVE TO SAVE THE MONEY FIRST IN THE REPUBLICAN BEFORE WE REACH OUT AND DO SOME OF THESE THINGS 
BUT I THINK HEALTH CARE SOME BILL WILL PASS THIS YEAR 
IT WON'T LOOK LIKE THE CLINTON BILL 
HE'LL GET CREDIT FOR IT 
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS 
QUICKLY 
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SENATOR 
IF YOU THERE'S A RUMOR AROUND CAPITOL HILL THERE'S GOING TO BE A DOLE MOYNIHAN BILL DEMOCRATIC SENATOR PAT MOYNIHAN CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE 
TRUE OR FALSE 
WELL IT'S TRUE THERE IS A RUMOR 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'LL BE A BILL I DON'T KNOW 
WE DID PUT TOGETHER SOCIAL SECURITY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH 
ARE YOU WORKING ON IT WITH HIM 
NOT YET 
BUT YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
O. K. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ROBERT DOLE 
THANK YOU 
MY PARTNER AND I WILL BE BACK WITH SOME COMMENTS AFTER THESE MESSAGES 
YOU KNOW BOB DOLE IS GOING TO HOLD THE PRESIDENT'S FEET TO THE FIRE ON THIS SPY ISSUE 
HE WANTS MORE SOVIET DIPLOMATS RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS EXPELLED FROM NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON IN THIS COUNTRY 
AND HE SAYS STOP AID UNTIL WE GET A FULL EXPLANATION 
HELL WILL FREEZE OVER BEFORE WE GET THAT EXPLANATION FROM MOSCOW 
ROWLY I WAS STRUCK BY HOW TOUGH SENATOR DOLE WAS ON THE NEW DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE STROBE TALBOTT 
HE SAID THAT THE THIRTY ONE VOTES AGAINST HIM FOR THE CONFIRMATION WAS JUST NOT PARTISANSHIP AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS 
AND HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO PERMIT A CONFIRMATION OF TALBOTT FOR THE HIGHER LEVEL OF SECRETARY OF STATE 
YOU KNOW BOB HE DID PRAISE BELIEVE IT OR NOT BILL CLINTON FOR INVITING ARAFAT AND RABIN TO WASHINGTON TO CONTINUE THESE TALKS AFTER THAT TERRIBLE DISASTER IN HEBRON WHEN SIXTY SEVEN OR WHATEVER IT WAS SEVENTY PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED 
BUT HE DID NOT SAY NO TO MY QUESTION SHOULD WE DISARM THE SETTLERS SO I THINK HE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM LOSE THEIR ARMS 
THE SENATOR WAS OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. CLINTON ON HEALTH CARE 
THE PRESIDENT WANTED A COMMITMENT FROM HIM FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
HE SAID WELL UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SOMEPLACE DOWN THE LINE 
SENATOR DOLE SAID THAT WILL SATISFY THE PRESIDENT 
I'M NOT SURE IT WILL 
I'M ROBERT NOVAK
