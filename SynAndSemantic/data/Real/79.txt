THE NUMBER TWO DRAW AT THE MOVIE BOX OFFICE THIS PAST WEEKEND WAS A NEW P. G. RATED SPORTS COMEDY CALLED THE MIGHTY DUCKS STARRING EMILIO 
C. N. N.'S CAROL HAS A REVIEW 
THE MIGHTY ASPIRES TO BE THE BAD NEWS ON ICE BUT IT FALLS FAR SHORT OF THAT MOVIE'S SUBVERSIVE 
EMILIO IS AS A HOT SHOT YOUNG LAWYER WHOSE PSYCHE WAS TWISTED WHEN HE FAILED TO SCORE THE CRUCIAL POINT IN A PEE WEE HOCKEY GAME 
HE GETS A CHANCE TO HEAL HIS INNER CHILD WHEN HE'S SENTENCED TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE AS YES YOU GUESSED IT THE HOCKEY COACH OF A BUNCH OF KIDS 
LACKS THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND THE PERFORMANCE ART TO CARRY THIS ROLE 
THE KIDS THEMSELVES ARE OKAY ALTHOUGH THE CHARACTERS THEY PLAY ARE CARDBOARD CLICHES 
THE SCRIPT IS PREDICTABLE THE DIRECTING PEDESTRIAN 
WHILE THE GRADE SCHOOL SET PROBABLY WILL UP OVER THE ON SCREEN ANTICS OF THE MIGHTY DUCKS ANYONE OVER AGE TEN IS LIKELY TO CONSIDER THESE BIRDS A BUNCH OF FROZEN TURKEYS
