THE MEDIA AND MINORITIES MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE MESSENGER TO TASK 
LIVE FROM C. N. N. NEW YORK 
INTELLIGENT TALK FOR INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WITH DOCTOR SONYA FRIEDMAN 
HELLO AGAIN 
I'M DEBORAH MARCHINI FILLING IN FOR DOCTOR SONYA FRIEDMAN 
THE WIDESPREAD MEDIA COVERAGE OF O. J. SIMPSON'S TRIAL MAY HAVE MORE TO DO WITH HIS CELEBRE THAN HIS RACE 
BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED MANY FROM USING THIS CASE AS A SPRINGBOARD FOR DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING DISTRUST OF THE NEWS MEDIA 
THE DARKENED PHOTO ILLUSTRATION OF SIMPSON ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE AND EARLY FOOTAGE OF HIM IN HANDCUFFS INFURIATED MANY MINORITIES 
THEY BELIEVE THE CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED DIFFERENTLY IF SIMPSON WERE A WHITE SUSPECT AND HAVE ONLY SERVED TO PERPETUATE RACIAL STEREOTYPES 
MY FIRST GUEST IS ROBERT 
HE'S A PROFESSOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AT NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY 
HE HAS SPENT HALF A DOZEN YEARS STUDYING THE PORTRAYAL OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ON NETWORK NEWS 
WE'VE SEEN POLLS PROFESSOR SHOWING THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE A BEEF WITH THE WAY THEY'RE PORTRAYED ON NETWORK NEWS 
IS IT A VALID ONE 
YES 
MY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BLACKS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY STEREOTYPED BY LOCAL NEWS AND NETWORK NEWS 
IN WHAT WAY 
BASICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME STORIES WHICH ARE VERY HEAVILY COVERED ON THE LOCAL NEWS BLACKS ARE MADE TO APPEAR MORE VIOLENT DANGEROUS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ACCUSED IN THE SAME TYPE OF CRIMES AS WHITE SUSPECTS 
FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE SHOWN TWICE AS MUCH PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED BY A POLICE OFFICER THAN WHITES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ACCUSED OF SIMILAR CRIMES 
IS NETWORK NEWS BETTER OR WORSE THAN NETWORK NEWS 
WELL 
IN ITS TRACK RECORD ON TREATMENT OF MINORITIES 
NETWORK NEWS IS DIFFERENT 
SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ISN'T AS MUCH COVERAGE OF YOU KNOW YOUR AVERAGE STREET CRIME 
ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE OF POLITICS IS PROBABLY WORSE 
SO YOU GET ONLY THE OCCASIONAL BLACK LEADER WHO'S USUALLY THERE BECAUSE HE'S COMMITTED A CRIME OR DONE SOMETHING HEINOUS AND IT GIVES A OF BLACK POLITICS 
O. K. 
WE ARE ALSO JOINED NOW WITH FROM ANOTHER GUEST WITH ANOTHER GUEST 
FELIX GUTIERREZ WITH THE FREEDOM FORUM FOUNDATION IS JOINING US FROM ATLANTA GEORGIA 
HE IS AMONG OTHER THINGS THE CO AUTHOR OF THE BOOK MINORITIES IN THE MEDIA 
FELIX YOU'VE JUST HEARD WHAT PROFESSOR HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE WAY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE TREATED IN THE MEDIA 
DOES THE SAME THING APPLY TO HISPANIC AMERICANS AND MEMBERS OF OTHER MINORITIES 
I THINK YOU CAN SAY SO 
IT'S A FAIR COMMENT TO SAY THAT WHEN WE'RE COVERED WE'RE COVERED AS PROBLEM PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER BY PROBLEMS IN THAT WE MAY BE POOR WE MAY COME FROM ANOTHER CULTURE AND WE SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE 
OR PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR THE LARGER SOCIETY 
AND THAT FOCUS GETS INTO COVERAGE OF CRIME AND OTHER KINDS OF ISSUES 
O. K. 
LET ME PLAY THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE AND ASK YOU A QUESTION WHICH IS TO WHAT EXTENT ARE MEMBERS OF MINORITIES PROBLEM PEOPLE 
ARE MINORITIES BEING COVERED AS PARTICIPANTS IN CRIME BECAUSE THEY ARE PARTICIPANTS IN CRIMES MORE OFTEN 
I THINK WE'RE BEING COVERED AS PARTICIPANTS IN CRIMES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE OR SEEING OR HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THE WHITE SOCIETY 
WE'RE PORTRAYED AS A THREAT 
WE'RE PORTRAYED AS SOMEONE WHO HAS COME IN TO CHANGE THINGS WHO PERHAPS IS BRINGING SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
AND FOR THAT REASON THAT'S WHERE THEY PERCEIVE US 
WE ARE COVERED THROUGH ANGLO EYES NOT AS WE REALLY ARE 
AND UNTIL THAT LENS IS REMOVED AND WE ARE ABLE TO PORTRAY OURSELVES IN OUR OWN LIGHT AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO APPRECIATE US IN OUR OWN LIGHT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS KIND OF COVERAGE 
PROFESSOR IN TERMS OF THE WAY AND FREQUENCY WITH WHICH AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE PORTRAYED IN THE NEWS MEDIA IN CRIME SITUATIONS TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION RATES IN CRIME 
WELL THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO SAY 
NUMBER ONE IT IS TRUE THAT ON AVERAGE STATISTICALLY YOUNG BLACK MALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES THAN YOUNG WHITE MALES 
BUT A LOT IS LEFT OUT OF THAT STORY IF YOU DON'T GIVE THE WHOLE CONTEXT 
WHAT'S LEFT OUT 
WHAT'S LEFT OUT IS FIRST OF ALL MIDDLE CLASS BLACKS ARE NO MORE LIKELY THAN MIDDLE CLASS WHITES TO COMMIT CRIMES 
AND NUMBER TWO THERE'S THE WHOLE CONTEXT OF RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION LACK OF OPPORTUNITY WHICH PROBABLY CAUSES THAT INCREASED CRIME 
BUT YOUR POINT WOULD BE THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SKIN COLOR 
I DON'T THINK CERTAINLY IT SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING INHERENTLY WITH SKIN COLOR 
IF IT DID THEN MIDDLE CLASS BLACKS WOULD BE OUT COMMITTING ALL OF THESE CRIMES AND THEY'RE NOT 
O. K. 
I'VE ALSO SEEN STATISTICS THAT SHOW THAT BLACK AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF CRIMES THAN WHITE AMERICANS 
DOES THE MEDIA COVERAGE REFLECT THAT 
IT DOES SHOW A LOT OF BLACK VICTIMS 
BUT WHAT I'VE ONE OF MY RESEARCH PROJECTS FOUND THAT IF THE STORY IS ABOUT A BLACK VICTIM THEY GET ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THE COVERAGE OF WHITE VICTIMS 
SO THERE'S LESS ATTENTION TO BLACK VICTIMS IT WOULD APPEAR 
O. K. 
FELIX GUTIERREZ THERE'S BIAS HERE YOU THINK ISN'T THERE 
I THINK THERE IS AND IT'S BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE MANAGEMENT LEVEL AND UPPER LEVELS OF THESE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT FULLY REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE COVERING 
AS THIS NATION BECOMES INCREASINGLY MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR THESE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT 
WHAT YOU SEEM 
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO BRIDGE AND TO BUILD CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE COMMUNITIES 
WHAT YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING SIR IS THERE ARE TOO MANY WHITE PEOPLE MAYBE TOO MANY WHITE MALES RUNNING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS 
I'M SAYING 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
I'M SAYING IT BUT I'LL SAY IT IN A POSITIVE WAY 
THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE RUNNING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS 
NEWSPAPERS TODAY ARE STILL ONLY TEN PERCENT MINORITY WHEREAS WE'RE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION 
AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE ONLY ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT AGAIN 
SO THERE'S A BIG GAP THERE 
CAN I 
AND UNTIL WE BRIDGE THAT GAP 
O. K. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES 
PROFESSOR 
I JUST WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE I AGREE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT GOAL 
THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT NO MATTER WHO'S RUNNING THESE ORGANIZATIONS UNLESS YOU REDEFINE NEWS AND LOOK AT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF NEWS ORGANIZATIONS DIFFERENTLY IT DOESN'T MATTER 
I MEAN THERE ARE BLACK PRODUCERS BLACK ANCHORS OUT THERE WHO ARE TELLING THE STORIES THAT ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM WHAT WHITE PEOPLE WOULD BE SAYING IF THEY WERE IN THE SAME POSITION 
SO THE PROBLEM GOES EVEN DEEPER THAN JUST THE MANAGEMENT 
THE PROBLEM GOES DEEPER THAN JUST THE MANAGEMENT 
MR. GUTIERREZ WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
I WOULD SAY IT'S THE OTHER WAY 
IT GOES HIGHER THAN THE MANAGEMENT THAT HE LEVELS THAT HE MENTIONED 
PRODUCERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
NEWS DIRECTORS ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE NETWORK PRESIDENTS 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VERY TOP LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP FOR THESE CORPORATIONS 
BUT SIR 
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LINE PRODUCERS 
IN MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST SIR TOP MANAGEMENT HAS VIRTUALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DAY TO DAY CONTENT OF THE BROADCAST 
THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE DAY TO DAY CONTENT EXCEPT HIRE THE PEOPLE AND SET THE AGENDA AND TO TARGET THE AUDIENCE THAT THEY WANT TO REACH 
AND IF THEY TARGET A RACIALLY DIVERSE AUDIENCE I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE GROWTH OF MINORITY FOCUS MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING CHANNELS DIRECTED TO PEOPLE WHO SPEAK SPANISH AND OTHER LANGUAGES IS THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY ATTENTION TO THE MEDIA THAT PAYS ATTENTION TO THEM 
AND IF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DON'T WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO US WE WILL GO TO OTHER ALTERNATIVES 
ALL RIGHT 
UNTIL THEY LEARN THIS LESSON THEY'RE GOING TO END UP LOSING AUDIENCES AND WE'RE GOING TO END GET THE SHORT END ON COVERAGE 
ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK RIGHT HERE 
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA LOSING AUDIENCES AND TALK TO SOME MINORITY JOURNALISTS WHEN SONYA LIVE CONTINUES 
NATIONAL T. V. NEWS SHOWS MAKE RACE RELATIONS WORSE 
WHITES FORTY FOUR PERCENT 
AFRICAN AMERICANS FORTY TWO PERCENT 
HISPANICS TWENTY NINE PERCENT 
ASIANS NINETEEN PERCENT 
SAMPLE ERROR IS SIX PERCENT POINTS 
IS THE MEDIA MINORITIES 
JOINING ME NOW IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN JOURNALIST ASSOCIATION PAUL 
HE'S IN ATLANTA ATTENDING THE UNITY NINETY FOUR CONFERENCE WHICH IS EXAMINING THE ROLE AND INFLUENCE OF MINORITIES IN THE MEDIA 
HE SAYS THE MEDIA HAS DEFINITELY MISREPRESENTED AND HIS COMMUNITY 
AND HERE WITH ME IN NEW YORK IS TELEVISION PRODUCER RAY NUNN 
HE'S WORKED FOR A. B. C. AND N. B. C. AND IS NOW EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AT THE MEDICAL NEWS NETWORK 
HE SAYS THAT DURING HIS TIME WITH A MAJOR NETWORK A MAJOR BROADCAST NETWORK HE WAS ALWAYS BATTLING COVERAGE WHICH HE FELT PROMOTED STEREOTYPES 
LET ME ASK YOU RAY FIRST OF ALL WHAT WE'VE SEEN SOME POLLS THAT INDICATE THAT WHITES AND BLACKS THINK THAT NETWORK NEWS RACE RELATIONS ALMOST TO THE SAME DEGREE 
IS IT A VALID POINT 
I THINK IT IS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS WE TEND TO IN THE MEDIA WE GO FOR THE QUICK SELL STORY 
AND QUICK SELLS SIMPLISTIC SOLUTIONS TEND TO EITHER ONE CONFIRM STEREOTYPES OR SOMETIMES QUITE FRANKLY THEY PANDER TO PEOPLES' FEARS 
O. K. 
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU AS A TELEVISION PRODUCER HAVE DONE THAT YOURSELF 
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IN STORIES THAT I COVERED EARLY ON IN MY CAREER I WOUND UP COVERING AND PRODUCING STORIES THAT INDEED DID HAVE THAT EFFECT I THINK 
AS I WENT ALONG IN THE CAREER AND WIND WOUND UP HAVING A BIT MORE INFLUENCE AT A. B. C. AND C. B. S. AND PRINCIPALLY AT A. B. C. 
I NEVER WORKED AT C. B. S. 
BUT I THINK THAT IN THOSE PLACES THAT I HAD A BIT MORE INFLUENCE I WAS ABLE TO TRY TO THE STORIES IN WHAT I FELT WAS A MORE BALANCED DIRECTION 
WHY EARLY IN ON YOUR CAREER DID YOU PRODUCE STORIES THAT YOU FELT WERE NOT BALANCED AS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED 
QUITE FRANKLY 
LACK OF EXPERIENCE 
OR PRESSURE FROM MANAGEMENT 
I THINK IT'S ONE A LACK OF EXPERIENCE 
TWO QUIT WITH AN EQUAL ISSUE IS THE PRESSURE 
I MEAN YOU ARE INSIDE OF A SITUATION 
AND AS THE PROFESSOR MENTIONED EARLIER THERE IS A CERTAIN KIND OF DYNAMIC INSIDE THESE INSTITUTIONS 
AND YOU MUST FIRST PROVE THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT WITHIN THAT SYSTEM 
AND IT YOU TO SOME EXTENT 
AND ONLY ONCE YOU'VE PROVEN THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THEIR DO WILL SOMEONE THEN LISTEN TO YOU WHEN YOU SAY BUT I BEG TO DIFFER 
UNTIL YOU'VE ESTABLISHED YOURSELF YOU'RE REALLY WITHOUT PORTFOLIO 
AND REALLY YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO 
SO FOR A WHILE YOU'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO HELP 
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF GO ALONG 
THAT'S RIGHT 
TO GET ALONG 
THAT'S WHY THE EMPHASIS ON BRINGING MORE MINORITIES IN 
UH HUH 
ESPECIALLY AT THE LOWER LEVELS IS IT THIS ACTUALLY CREATES A FALSE IMPRESSION 
PAUL IF NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE A BEEF WITH THE WAY THE MEDIA THEM WHAT IS IT 
WELL I THINK THAT FAR TOO OFTEN WE'RE NOT PORTRAYED AT ALL 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLL THAT WAS JUST UP ON THE BOARD A LITTLE BIT EARLIER YOU'LL FIND THAT IT TALKS ABOUT HISPANICS BLACKS ASIAN AMERICANS BUT THERE ARE NO NATIVE AMERICANS 
AND MAYBE PEOPLE COULDN'T FIND ANY NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO POLL 
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THAT WE SEEM TO BE NOT ONLY UNREPRESENTED BUT INDEED WHEN OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DEALING WITH ISSUES ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS AND CROSS CULTURAL STORIES PART OF OUR EXPERIENCE IS SIMPLY THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND COLLEGES WHICH IS ANOTHER INSTITUTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT NATIVE PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY HISTORICAL BUT THEY'RE PRESENT IN THEIR FUTURE TENSE 
SO WE NEED TO DEMAND ACCESS IN PORTRAYAL AT ALL 
IT'S FAR TOO OFTEN WE'RE JUST SIMPLY ABSENT FROM THE FORMULA ALTOGETHER 
PROFESSOR 
YES 
I SPEAK I SEE YOU NODDING IN AGREEMENT 
I WAS AGREEING PARTICULARLY WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING OUT WHAT NATIVE AMERICANS THINK BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY OF POLLING 
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF POVERTY IN NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE TELEPHONES 
AND THAT BECOMES A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING OUT WHAT THEY THINK 
BUT I THINK EVERYTHING ELSE THE GENTLEMAN SAID IS QUITE TRUE 
ALL RIGHT 
WHAT ABOUT POLLING WHITES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF BLACKS 
DO YOU THINK WHITES THINK MEDIA COVERAGE OF BLACKS IS FAIR OR UNFAIR 
WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT SOME WHITES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE STEREOTYPING BUT MANY MORE BLACKS FEEL THAT WAY PERHAPS NATURALLY 
O. K. 
RAY DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT 
WELL I THINK IT'S TRUE 
THE BLACKS AND WOULD FEEL THAT WE'RE BEING STEREOTYPED BECAUSE IF WE KNOW THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE LIVE 
ACTUALLY I'VE RUN INTO A NUMBER OF WHITES WHO MAKE THE POINT THAT WELL THEY THINK IT'S AN SOMETIMES THE COVERAGE ON MINORITIES 
AND BLACK HISPANIC INDIANS WHATEVER THEY JUST THINK WELL WHY YOU'RE OBSESSING WITH IT 
AND I THINK THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE THE JOB OF EXPLAINING TO THE REST OF THIS SOCIETY HOW DRAMATICALLY THE SOCIETY IS CHANGING 
WE HAVEN'T PREPARED THEM FOR CHANGE 
WE HAVEN'T EDUCATED THEM ABOUT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS COUNTRY 
FELIX GUTIERREZ WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY OF BIASED NEWS 
SHOULD MINORITY JOURNALISTS COVER MINORITY STORIES 
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS AN ABILITY THERE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE USE OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL SKILLS THAT YOU MAY HAVE 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MINORITY PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONFINED ONLY TO THOSE STORIES NOR DO I THINK THAT WHITE REPORTERS WHO HAVE AN INTEREST AND ABILITY IN COVERING THOSE STORIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
IF IT'S A GOOD NEWS STORY IF IT'S A TOP STORY IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT SAY SOMETHING THAT CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD AND AFFECTS ALL OF US THEN ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO COVER IT 
IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO DISAGREES WITH THAT STATEMENT 
I IT JUST WHAT MR. GUTIERREZ SAID REMINDED ME TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE DEFINITION OF NEWS IS THAT AN ISOLATED INSTANCE OF CRIME THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT PROBABLY DOESN'T AFFECT MANY PEOPLE 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK NEWS ORGANIZATIONS TO REDEFINE WHAT THEY MEAN BY NEWS 
UH HUH 
AND I THINK THAT IF YOU ADD TO THAT ONE OTHER POINT IS THAT IN DEFINING NEWS WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE 
YOU DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE MINORITIES AFRICAN AMERICANS OR HISPANICS FROM COVERING STORIES ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY 
NOR DO YOU WANT TO EXCLUDE WHITES 
WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS THAT THE PERSPECTIVE THE SPIN ON THE STORY REALLY BEGINS IN THE EXECUTIVE SUITE WHERE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER IF YOU'RE IN A TELEVISION OPERATION SAYS O. K. 
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO GO AFTER 
AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE SAYING INCLUDE US IN THE PERSPECTIVE MAKING PROCESS 
INCLUDE US IN THEIR MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE DEFINITELY ABSENT 
PAUL AS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION LET ME ASK YOU 
YOU SAY THAT NATIVE AMERICANS ARE BASICALLY BEING LEFT OUT OF THE NEWS COVERAGE ALTOGETHER PERHAPS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CASINO GAMBLING HERE ON THE EAST COAST 
WHAT STORIES ARE WE THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA MISSING 
WELL I THINK THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS MISSING HORDES OF STORIES 
WE CAN GO JUST DOWN THE LINE OF THE TYPICAL STORIES THAT MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS DEALING WITH AND APPLY THEM TO THE NATIVE COMMUNITY 
WE HAVE LEADERS 
WE HAVE ISSUES 
WE HAVE MANY THINGS THAT THE CAN BE CAST IN A WAY THAT HELPS EDUCATIONAL EDUCATE THE PUBLIC SO THAT SOME OF THE CRISES THAT PEOPLE FACE AS NATIVE AMERICAN GAMBLING CAME ABOUT CERTAIN TREATY RIGHTS ISSUES ON AND OFF THE RESERVATION OCCURRED WE WOULD HAVE SUCH A CRISES TO DEAL WITH 
WHAT CRISES 
WHAT ISSUES SPECIFICALLY 
WELL THERE'S ALL KINDS OF ISSUES 
DEFINITELY RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS MASCOTS AND LOGOS AND THEIR USE IN THE SPORTS AND IN THE MEDIA OF THESE CARICATURES WHICH ARE INSENSITIVE 
ANYTHING FROM THE ATLANTA BRAVES 
INCLUDING THE ATLANTA BRAVES 
WHICH IS OWNED BY TURNER BROADCASTING WHO 
MANY MANY OFFENDERS 
UH HUH 
LAST NIGHT AT ONE OF THE FORUMS IN WHICH A NUMBER OF EXECUTIVES WERE ADDRESSED WAS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW WHAT KIND OF A POLICY CAN BE ADOPTED IN TERMS OF THE USE OF MASCOTS LOGOS AND CARICATURES FOR BUSINESS OR SPORTS PURPOSES 
NOBODY ANSWERED THE QUESTION 
AND ONE ANSWER THAT CAME OUT FROM ARTHUR WAS SIMPLY THAT HE WAS FROM A TOWN WHERE THERE WAS THE NEW YORK YANKEES 
AND WHILE HE'S APOLOGIZED FOR THAT I THINK THE ABSENCE SPOKE FOR ITSELF 
ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK RIGHT HERE 
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU IN THE AUDIENCE 
THE NUMBER IS TWO ONE TWO SIX FOUR THREE ZERO ZERO SEVEN SEVEN 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACE AND THE MEDIA AND WHETHER THE MEDIA IS FAIR 
SONYA LIVE CONTINUES 
WELCOME BACK TO SONYA LIVE 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MEDIA RACE AND FAIRNESS 
AND WE HAVE A CALLER KATHERINE FROM WISCONSIN 
KATHERINE WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT 
YEAH 
WELL I HAVE A COMMENT 
IN NINETY THREE I TOOK THE YEAR TO DO RESEARCH INTO LOCAL NEWSROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND TO WHAT EXTENT THEIR INTEREST WAS IN DEVELOPING WOMEN AND MINORITIES 
UH HUH 
AT MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVES LEVELS 
I FOUND THAT NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THE NEWSROOMS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WERE COVERED BY WHITE MALES 
AND I FIND IT VERY DISGUSTING 
AND SO I TOOK NINETY FOUR TO START AN APPROACH INTO THE PUBLISHERS OF NEWSPAPERS AND THE EXECUTIVES AT THE TELEVISION STATIONS TO SOLICIT AND TO RECRUIT FOR THEM MINORITIES 
I AM A TWENTY YEAR IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 
UH HUH 
AND I FOUND THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THEIR PART IN MY WORKING FOR THEM AND BRINGING IN MANAGEMENT WITH MY EXPERIENCE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING MORE DIVERSITY 
WHAT 
I ALSO FOUND THAT THE INTEREST LEVEL IN THE MINORITY SUCH AS THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS AND ASIAN JOURNALISTS WAS NOT THAT STRONG 
AND SO I WONDER HOW I AS ONE INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTING TO HELP IN CAN DO MORE 
RAY NUNN IS IT TOUGH TO CRACK MANAGEMENT IN NETWORK TELEVISION AT LEAST 
IT'S EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO CRACK MANAGEMENT 
THERE ARE CEILINGS 
WOMEN THAT I'VE COLLEAGUES OF MINE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT 
AND INSIDE A. B. C. AS WELL AS MEN ESPECIALLY MINORITY MEN THAT I'VE TALKED TO 
THERE IS A CEILING 
WE KNOW IT IN ITS SENSE YOU SENSE THAT IT IS THAT IF YOU ARE AN O. K. PRODUCER A VERY GOOD PRODUCER INDEED THAT'S JUST FINE 
BUT WHEN YOU START PRESSING AND SAYING BUT I CAN MAKE DECISIONS AND I WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT BECOMES INHERENTLY DIFFICULT 
THAT SOMEHOW RAISES THE IRON AND THE CEILING STARTS LOWERING 
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW BOOM 
YOU'VE HIT IT 
AND I WANT TO MAKE JUST ONE POINT 
RIGHT NOW IN ATLANTA THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSAND MINORITY JOURNALISTS ASSEMBLED 
AND I'LL BET YOU DOLLARS TO DONUTS THAT WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM EVERY EXECUTIVE DOWN THERE IS WE'RE DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIND TALENT 
THE REASON WHY WE DON'T HAVE TALENT IN THE EXECUTIVE SUITE IS BECAUSE WE THEY JUST AREN'T TRAINED AND WE CAN'T FIND ANY 
THAT'S THE BIGGEST LIE 
THEY'VE BEEN TELLING IT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS 
AND ENOUGH ALREADY 
WE HAVE SOMEBODY DOWN THERE 
IT'S PAUL AS A MATTER OF FACT 
PAUL IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING 
WELL I THINK THAT WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF COMMITMENT 
THE REASON WE'RE DOWN HERE IS TO TRY TO A POSITIVE PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH WE'RE A FULL PARTNER IN JOURNALISTS UP AND MAKING SURE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH RESOURCES 
INDEED THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT SOME OF THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE WHEN WE WALK THROUGH THE NEWSROOMS LIKE WHEN WE WALKED THROUGH THE C. N. N. NEWSROOM WE SEE VISIBLY HOW COLORLESS SOME OF THESE NEWSROOMS STILL ARE 
SO WE'RE NOT SEEING THE RESULTS OF THE WORDS THAT ARE BEING SPOKEN 
FELIX GUTIERREZ WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MINORITIES IN THE NEWSROOM AND THEIR REPRESENTATION THERE AS OPPOSED TO IN OTHER WORKPLACES 
WELL IT'S STILL A VERY SEGREGATED PROFESSION 
REALLY 
WITH ONLY TEN PERCENT OF NEWSPAPER REPORTERS AND EDITORS BEING FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR 
AND FOR US IN TERMS OF THEM MOVING UP THE GLASS CEILING ISSUE 
THE HARD PART FOR US ISN'T DOING THE JOB IT'S GETTING THE JOB BECAUSE WE JUST SIMPLY ARE NOT AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITIES 
THIS IS STILL A SUPPLY AND DEMAND SITUATION 
AND IF THERE WAS A DEMAND FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AT THE VERY TOP LEVELS THEY COULD BE FOUND 
ALL RIGHT 
WE HAVE A CALL ALSO FROM TOM IN OKLAHOMA WHOM I BELIEVE HAS A COMMENT OR A QUESTION ON THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE 
YES I DO 
IN DEALING IN LISTENING TO THE INITIAL OF THE O. J. SIMPSON HIS ALLEGED MURDER I HEARD VERY LITTLE IF NOTHING ABOUT THE PERCEIVED RACISM THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT'S FLOATING TO THE MEDIA RIGHT NOW UNTIL IT WAS MENTIONED BY MEDIA PERSONNEL COVERING THE STORY 
AND I WAS WONDERING THIS IS A QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOUR PANELISTS IF THIS IS AN ISSUE NOT CREATED BY THE DEFENSE OR THE PROSECUTION BUT CREATED BY MEDIA'S TO THE ISSUE FOR INSTANCE ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE 
THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD AND VERY INTERESTING QUESTION 
PROFESSOR LET ME START WITH YOU 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY WAY TO ESCAPE THE ISSUE OF RACE 
EITHER WE TALK ABOUT IT OVERTLY OR WE MAKE BELIEVE IT DOESN'T EXIST 
WELL HAS THE DEFENSE 
BUT IT'S THERE 
HAS THE DEFENSE BEEN DRUMMING UP INTEREST IN RACE AS AN ISSUE 
SURE THEY HAVE AND THE PROCESS WELL THEY THEY'RE THE YOU KNOW 
THE RACIST WHITE COP ALLEGEDLY AND SO FORTH 
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF HIGH TECH DEFENSE NOW 
BUT OUR BUT OUR CALLER IS CORRECT IN A SENSE THAT A LOT OF THE TALK ABOUT RACE AS AN ISSUE IN THIS TRIAL STARTED BEFORE THOSE ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE 
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IT'S ALWAYS THERE IN AMERICA 
AND EITHER WE CAN BRING IT OUT AND BE HONEST ABOUT IT OR MAKE BELIEVE IT DOESN'T EXIST 
THE QUESTION IS THEN AND I'LL ASK YOU RAY IS THE MEDIA MAKING RACE MORE OF AN ISSUE THAN IT IS 
NO I DON'T THEY REALLY AREN'T 
AND I NOT IN THE AND NOT IN THE CASE OF O. J. 
IT'S A MATTER OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE PUTTING IT IN PERSPECTIVE 
BUT THEY AREN'T MAKING IT MORE OF AN ISSUE 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT OVER OUR BACK YARDS 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE AT SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 
AND LET'S FACE IT AMERICANS DO THAT 
WHAT WE TALK MAYBE WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING AS MEDIA IS PUTTING IT IN AN EFFECTIVE CONTEXT WHERE WE ARE ALLOWING THIS NOTION TO PERSIST THAT THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A FALLEN BLACK ROLE MODEL 
INSTEAD OF ASKING OURSELVES WAIT A MINUTE 
IS ROLE MODEL THE RIGHT IS THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT PLACE TO PUT ANYBODY WHO'S AN ENTERTAINER OR PERFORMER 
BEING A MOST VALUABLE PLAYER DOES NOT MAKE YOU A MOST VALUABLE PERSON 
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THAT ROUTE 
WE HAVE ACCEPTED IT IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S A SHORTCUT TO THE NOTION OF PROVING AND DEMONSTRATING EQUALITY 
ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK RIGHT HERE 
WHEN SONYA LIVE CONTINUES WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT RACE AND THE MEDIA 
WE'LL LOOK AT ENTERTAINMENT AND WHETHER ITS TRACK ANY BETTER THAN THE NEWS MEDIA'S AND TAKE MORE CALLS 
SONYA LIVE WILL CONTINUE 
NATIONAL T. V. NEWS SHOWS GIVE TOO MUCH COVERAGE TO CRIME 
WHITES FIFTY NINE PERCENT 
HISPANICS FIFTY ONE PERCENT 
ASIANS FORTY THREE PERCENT 
AFRICAN AMERICANS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT 
SAMPLE ERROR IS SIX PERCENT POINTS 
AS THE TIME SLASH C. N. N. POLLS HAVE SHOWED WHITES SURVEYED BELIEVE THE NATIONAL MEDIA SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME COVERING CRIME WHILE AFRICAN AMERICANS THINK THERE ISN'T ENOUGH CRIME COVERAGE 
WELL JOINING ME NOW U. S. A. TODAY COLUMNIST BARBARA REYNOLDS 
SHE SAYS MEDIA COVERAGE OF MINORITIES IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL 
BARBARA GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US 
GLAD TO BE HERE 
IF WHITES THINK WE'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME COVERING CRIME AND MINORITY MEMBERS THINK WE'RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH COVERING CRIME WHO'S RIGHT 
IS THIS A SYMPTOM OF BIAS 
I THINK THEY'RE BOTH RIGHT 
IT'S WHO YOUR PUTTING THE CAMERAS ON 
FOR EXAMPLE MOST STATISTICS HAVE SAID THAT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO USE DRUGS ARE INDEED WHITE 
SO COVER THE CRIME SCENE AND TAKE YOUR CAMERAS TAKE YOUR PENCILS 
GO OUT INTO THE SUBURBS 
LET'S GET TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM 
THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OR MORE OF ALL DECISIONS ARE MADE BY WHITE MALES IN THIS INDUSTRY 
YOU LOOK AT WHO ARE THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS 
YOU LOOK AT WHO ARE THE TALKING HEADS THE T. V. PUNDITS 
YOU HAVE THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN COLUMNISTS WHO ARE FEMALE IN THIS COUNTRY 
I'M ONE OF THEM 
CERTAINLY THERE ARE MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WHO CAN WRITE AND REPORT 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WORLD THAT IS 
BUT 
THAT IS DEFINED REPORTED AND ANALYZED THROUGH THE EYES OF WHITE MALES 
BARBARA REYNOLDS I HAVE TO ARGUE WITH YOU HERE 
I HAVE TWO GENTLEMEN SITTING RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK IN THIS STUDIO WITH ME BOTH OF WHOM HAVE SAID THAT SOMETIMES THE BIASED COVERAGE COMES FROM BLACK ANCHORS 
NOW LET ME EXPLAIN WHY THIS EXISTS 
THERE WAS A REPORT BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS LAST YEAR THAT SAID ONE THIRD OF THE BLACKS ARE NO 
IT WAS TWO THIRDS OF THE BLACKS IN NEWSROOMS ARE AFRAID TO EVEN RAISE THE ISSUE OF RACE 
THAT THE NEWSROOMS ARE SO HOSTILE TO PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT MANY OF THEM ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT AND RAISE THE QUESTIONS OF RACE BECAUSE THEY FEAR THAT THEY WILL BE FIRED OR WON'T BE PROMOTED 
I THINK I I DON'T I THINK POINT IS SIGNIFICANT HERE 
WE DON'T HAVE A REAL DISAGREEMENT WITH THE EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY THAT I HAVE HAD AND IN THE IN THE NEWSROOM SUGGESTS THAT BOTH PERSONALLY WHEN I BEGAN YOU NO ONE WAS GOING TO LISTEN TO ME 
AND TOO IT TOOK A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU I FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO BUCK THE SYSTEM MYSELF AND SAY WAIT A MINUTE 
THIS IS ALL WRONG 
AND THEN YOU STILL ARE TRYING TO LOOK FOR A SYMPATHETIC EAR 
AND WHY SHOULD YOU ALWAYS BE TRYING TO FIND THIS SYMPATHETIC EAR 
WHY IT WOULD BE MUCH QUITE FRANKLY IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER 
WE WOULD BE I WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE IF THAT EAR AND THAT PERCEPTION ON HOW TO COVER A STORY HAD EXISTED INSIDE THE EXECUTIVE SUITE 
RIGHT 
AND IF YOU PUSH AND YOU RAISE THESE ISSUES YOU GET THE LABEL OF A AND OFTEN YOUR CAREER DOES NOT TAKE OFF 
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO JOURNALISTS 
WE ALL CARE ABOUT THE MEDIA 
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GO TO THE O. J. SIMPSON STORY YOU SAY HOW DID THE ISSUE OF RACE GET STARTED 
I CAN TELL YOU HOW 
ON JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH WE HAD THIS COVER IN TIME MAGAZINE OF A SHADED OF A SINISTER LOOKING MAGAZINE COVER OF O. J. SIMPSON THAT WAS DOCTORED TO SHOW HIM OR SUGGEST THAT HE WAS SINISTER AND THEREFORE GUILTY 
HE WAS DOCTORED ACTUALLY TO MAKE HIM LOOK DARKER 
I'D LIKE TO POLL ALL OF MY GUESTS 
WELL NO NOT DARKER BUT 
NOT DARKER 
NUMBER 
NO IT WASN'T JUST HIS FACE IT WAS HOW THE WHOLE COVER I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE 
IT WASN'T JUST HIS FACE BECAUSE DARK IN ITSELF IS DOES NOT SAY YOU'RE GUILTY 
BUT IT WAS THE THEME THE SHADES OF THE WHOLE THING THAT WAS DOCTORED 
ARE YOU 
IT WAS 
ARE 
IT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE HIM LOOK MORE MENACING 
YES 
EXACTLY 
AND 
YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE HIM LOOK MORE BLACK 
NO 
THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING 
NUMBER 
NOT 
NUMBER 
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING 
IT WAS FOR DRAMATIC IT WAS FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT 
AND THE VERY NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE EDITORS DIDN'T KNOW IT 
UH HUH 
I THAT THIS WOULD BE OFFENSIVE 
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE 
RAY YOU'VE YOU SOUND ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE DEFENDING THEM THOUGH 
NUMBER 
I AM NOT DEFENDING THEM 
I I MEAN IT WAS DONE WE KNOW WHAT THIS BUSINESS IS ABOUT 
A LARGE PART OF IT IS WE WANT PEOPLE TO BUY THE MAGAZINES AND THE NEWSPAPERS 
AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO WATCH THE SHOWS 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU ALLOW THOSE FORCES TO INFLUENCE KEY DECISIONS ABOUT SIGNIFICANT STORIES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE LION KING HERE 
WE'RE TALKING ALSO NOT ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT BUT WE'RE TALKING ALSO ABOUT THE BROADER ISSUE OF RACE IN AMERICA 
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO THROW OUT THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW I'VE GOT TO SELL PAPERS MAGAZINES AND STORIES 
RIGHT 
AND SAY LET'S BE STRAIGHT UP ABOUT IT 
EXACTLY 
IT'S NOT JUST WITH THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE 
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE JUNE THIRTEENTH ISSUE OF NEWSWEEK BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST LET IT APPEAR THAT TIME DID SOMETHING WRONG AND OTHERS DON'T 
O. K. 
WHAT'D NEWSWEEK DO 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS NEWSWEEK YOU SEE THREE PEOPLE ON THE COVER UNDER THE CAPTION VIRTUE PENNY WILLIAM BENNETT AND HILLARY CLINTON 
NOW THE ISSUE IS THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT DECLINING MORALS 
WELL THEY'RE ALL WHITE 
IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMETHING ANGELIC SOMETHING PIOUS IS ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE 
THOSE WHO CAUSED THE MORAL DECLINE WOULD BE BLACKS 
BUT 
SO WOULD YOU HAVE A COVER OF EVIL AND HAVE IT UNDER BLACK FACES THE 
WELL THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION 
BUT YOU RAISE ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION AND A SERIOUS ONE BARBARA 
AND THAT IS WHAT KINDS OF ROLE MODELS ARE WE PORTRAYING HERE FOR MINORITY MEMBERS 
LET ME PUT THAT QUESTION TO FELIX GUTIERREZ 
WELL THE KIND OF ROLE MODELS WE'RE PLAYING IS WHERE WE'VE SEEN THE OPPORTUNITY 
THAT'S WHY O. J. SIMPSON'S SUCH A HERO 
WE'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES IN SPORTS 
WE'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES IN MUSIC 
WE'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES WHERE TALENT IS THE REAL BASIS FOR HOW FAR YOU GO 
WHAT IS THE NEWS COVERAGE 
AND WE'VE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER KINDS OF PROFESSIONS AND NEWS COVERAGE IS THE CAUSE OF THAT 
BUT I DON'T THINK 
SO YOU THINK THE NEWS COVERAGE IS MERELY REFLECTING THAT 
AND YOU DON'T THINK THE NEWS COVERAGE IS BIASED AND THAT IT ONLY COVERS MINORITY ATHLETES OR MINORITY ENTERTAINERS 
NO I THINK IT IS BIASED IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOES NOT COVER US IN OUR FULL RANGE 
WE HAVE DOCTORS WE HAVE LAWYERS WE HAVE ECONOMISTS 
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW THEIR EXPERTISE IN A WIDE RANGE OF AREAS BUT THE MEDIA DON'T GO TO THAT 
THEY STILL FOCUS ON PROBLEM PEOPLE AND THEY FOCUS US IN NEWS STORIES IN OUR FULL GLORY AS MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE DAY OR POW WOWS OR CHINESE NEW YEARS 
BUT 
RIGHT 
ASIDE FROM THAT AND ASIDE FROM A FEW CELEBRITIES YOU DON'T SEE US IN THE MEDIA 
I'M REMINDED 
AND THAT'S INTENTIONAL 
I'M REMINDED OF SOMETHING THAT GOES TO WHAT MR. GUTIERREZ IS SAYING 
WHEN WE DID A DOCUMENTARY AT A. B. C. CALLED BLACK AND WHITE AMERICA ONE SEGMENT HAD TO DO WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO WERE IN WHO WERE MIDDLE CLASS AND IN PROFESSIONS 
ONE PROMINENT CRITIC FOR A NEWSPAPER WROTE WHAT WAS THE POINT 
WHY HAVE THEM IN THERE 
AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN YOU DON'T REALLY GET IT DO YOU 
THAT THIS IS A CHANCE TO SHOW THE FULL RANGE OF WHO WE ARE 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ATHLETES 
IT'S NOT JUST PERFORMERS 
BUT THE FACT THAT AN OPINION MAKE A CRITIC MISSES THE BOAT ON IT TELLS YOU I CAN'T IF HE MISSES THE BOAT I HAVE NO HOPE THAT THE AVERAGE JOE SITTING ON THE WALKING DOWN THE STREET IN ATLANTA IS GOING TO GET IT 
LET'S AS PROFESSOR ROBERT 
YES 
BUT WHAT 
WHO SAYS SIX 
I HAVE TO WEIGH IN HERE ON THIS ISSUE 
ALL RIGHT 
I'LL GIVE YOU A SECOND 
OF THE HEROES 
GO AHEAD 
YES 
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT AN ATHLETE IS A HERO WHICH RULES OUT WOMEN 
YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT US 
IF WE CAN'T PLAY FOOTBALL 
THERE ARE FEMALE ATHLETES 
WELL WE CAN'T PLAY FOOTBALL WE'RE NOT HEROES 
THIS IS A WAY THAT THE MEDIA DEFINES HEROES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR 
AND I WOULD SAY THAT JUST YOU'RE AN ATHLETE OR HAVE ON A UNIFORM THAT DOES NOT MAKE YOU A HERO NOR A ROLE MODEL 
I WANT TO ASK ROBERT SINCE YOU'VE SPENT NEARLY SIX YEARS STUDYING THE SAY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE PORTRAYED IN NETWORK NEWS 
DO WE SEE ANY AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS LAWYERS OR OTHER PROFESSIONALS 
OR ALL IS ALL WE SEE ENTERTAINERS AND ATHLETES 
WE SEE RELATIVELY FEW OF THOSE PROFESSIONALS IN STORIES THAT AREN'T ABOUT SOME KIND OF BLACK ISSUE LIKE CRIME OR POVERTY 
RIGHT 
AND IS THAT ACCURATE OR IS IT BIASED 
I THINK THE IMPRESSION IT LEAVES IS BIASED AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING 
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF MOST OF THOSE BLACKS YOU SEE BEING SPORTS FIGURES AND CRIMINALS 
ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK RIGHT HERE 
I'M AFRAID WE'RE OUT OF TIME 
WE'LL COME BACK IN JUST A MINUTE AND TAKE MORE OF YOUR PHONE CALLS ON SONYA LIVE 
WELCOME BACK TO SONYA LIVE WHERE WE'RE DISCUSSING MINORITIES AND THE MEDIA 
WE HAVE A CALL FROM LISA IN WASHINGTON STATE 
LISA WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT 
WELL MY COMMENT IS THAT I WITNESSED A DRUG DEAL GO BAD 
AND I KNEW THE GUY WAS A DOPE DEALER 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS BY THE TIME IT GOT TO THE NEWS THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION 
OH IT'S A CARJACKING 
AND OH YOU KNOW OOH 
IS IT A GANG FROM IS IT A GANG FROM L. A. 
ARE WE HAVING GANGS IN SEATTLE 
THEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T IT WAS A WHITE PERSON THAT CAME FROM THE SUBURBS TO BUY DRUGS IN MY SISTER'S NEIGHBORHOOD 
UH HUH 
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE 
UH HUH 
AND SAW THE WHOLE THING 
DO YOU THINK IT REFLECTED ANY BIAS ON THE PART OF THE NEWS MEDIA 
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THAT WAS BIAS 
HOW 
HOW SO 
IN WHAT WAY 
IT WAS OBVIOUS BECAUSE HERE WHAT PEOPLE SAW WAS A WHAT PEOPLE SAW WAS BLACK PEOPLE BEING PORTRAYED AS YOU KNOW THESE VIOLENT TYPES THAT YOU KNOW WANT TO STEAL WHITE PEOPLE'S CARS 
AND WHITE PEOPLE BETTER BE THEY BETTER WATCH OUT 
AND THEY BETTER BUY GUNS AND KEEP BLACK FOLKS IN ONE LITTLE SPACE YOU KNOW 
KEEP THEM IN THE C. D. AND STAY OUT OF THE C. D. 
OH YOU KNOW SHE WAS A WHITE WOMAN 
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DRIVING IN THE C. D. 
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT I SAW 
PROFESSOR ROBERT DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT 
YEAH 
THIS BRINGS TO MIND THE COVERAGE OF THE LOS ANGELES RIOTS 
UH HUH 
IN WHICH IT WAS FOUND THAT BLACKS MADE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE YOU SAW ON THE SCREEN 
BUT IN FACT LATINOS WERE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED DURING THE RIOT 
PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR MINDS A SENSE THAT WELL IF IT'S A RIOT IT MUST BE BLACK 
AND THAT IN FACT WAS A VERY INTEGRATED ACTIVITY OF MAYBE ONE OF THE FEW THAT WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY 
FELIX GUTIERREZ I WANT TO PUT THAT QUESTION TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD ONE 
DO HISPANICS GET NOT AS BAD A RAP AS AFRICAN AMERICANS WHEN IT COMES TO THE MEDIA 
WE DON'T GET AS MUCH INCLUSION ACROSS THE BOARD 
UH HUH 
THE MEDIA STILL FRAMES RACIAL ISSUES IN BLACK AND WHITE 
BUT THAT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN ISSUE THAT WAS FRAMED IN BLACK AND WHITE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ALSO A LATINO SITUATION 
IT WAS A LATINO AND IT WAS ASIAN 
AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE OUT THERE FOR WHATEVER REASON HAD REASONS TO BE OUT THERE TO RIOT OR TO LOOT 
THEY WERE FEELING THE SAME IMPRESSION THAT THE BLACKS WERE 
AND UNTIL 
WE CAN ONLY THINK 
UNTIL WE LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY AS THE MULTIRACIAL COUNTRY THAT IT IS THE NEWS MEDIA ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING AN EFFECTIVE JOB OF TELLING PEOPLE WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING 
SO YOU WOULD ALMOST MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE WHITE NEWS MEDIA WAS SO BIASED AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THAT SITUATION THAT THEY DIDN'T BOTHER TO LOOK TO SEE WHO WAS REALLY DOING THE DOING THE RIOTING 
AND THEY DIDN'T DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON 
WELL IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT CAN SPEAK SPANISH 
IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN GOING BEYOND THE WHAT THEY FEEL IS THE OBVIOUS STEREOTYPE 
THIS IS A MULTIRACIAL COUNTRY 
AND CERTAINLY LOS ANGELES I'M A NATIVE OF EAST LOS ANGELES IS AN AREA THAT HAS THE MOST RACIAL DIVERSITY OF ANY CITY 
AND THAT STORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED IN THAT WAY 
AND ONE OTHER POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE THERE 
UH HUH 
GO AHEAD 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COVER A RIOT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT A RIOT IN LOS ANGELES WHEN THE KEY ARE SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY 
AND WHAT YOU WIND UP DOING OFTENTIMES IS FULFILLING THEIR EXPECTATIONS THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE STORY 
BECAUSE LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE A BUREAU CHIEF IN L. A. IF THAT EXECUTIVE PRODUCER SAYS I WANT THIS 
I'M LOOKING FOR THAT 
OR YOU SENSE THAT'S WHAT HE OR SHE WANTS AND BASICALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MEN YOU GO GIVE IT TO THEM 
ALL RIGHT 
WE HAVE ANOTHER CALL FROM IN TENNESSEE 
WHAT'S YOUR COMMENT OR QUESTION 
IS WITH US 
THIS IS PAUL 
O. K. 
WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST 
I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ALSO 
BARBARA 
YES 
YES 
UH HUH 
I WANTED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION 
SURE 
FIRST OF ALL YOU THE EXPECTATION ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
IT'S SO HARD TO GET GOOD NEWS OUT ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS 
FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SHOW THAT THE MAIN GROUP WHO IS WINNING IN SAYING NO TO DRUGS ARE YOUNG BLACK TEENAGERS 
THE SECOND GROUP OF PEOPLE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY THOSE WHO ARE SAYING NO TO CIGARETTES ARE YOUNG BLACK MEN 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF YOUNG TEENAGERS SMOKED BOTH BLACK AND WHITE 
NOW THAT HAS GONE DOWN TO EIGHT PERCENT OF YOUNG BLACK MEN 
YOUNG BLACK MEN ARE SAYING NO TO DRUGS BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THESE ARE FROM OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REPORTS 
YOU TRY TO GET THE NEWS OUT BUT THE MEDIA FOR SOME REASON HAS IT LOCKED IN THEIR MINDS THAT YOUNG BLACK MEN ARE THUGS OR ARE GANGSTERS AND ARE 
AND THIS HAS BEEN 
THERE'S A 
THIS OF COURSE IS PERPETRATED 
I CAN ALL RIGHT 
BARBARA 
BY ENTERTAINMENT 
I CAN MAKE A SIMILAR OBSERVATION AND ADDRESS IT TO PAUL 
WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS AMERICAN INDIANS HAVE TO DO WITH ALCOHOLISM 
ABSOLUTELY 
I THINK IT JUST SHOWS THE POWER OF THE PRESS TO CREATE CERTAIN IMAGES BECAUSE IN THE NATIVE COMMUNITY THERE IS THERE ARE MANY SOBER PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE 
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF HOW THE PRESS HAS DEALT DIFFERENTLY ON A RACIAL AND A FINANCIAL BASIS WHICH INCLUDES THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE HISTORICALLY WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW PATTY HEARST WAS DEALT WITH IN TERMS OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED WHEN SHE WAS WITH THE S. L. A. AND HOW THE CRIMES AND SCENARIO WAS BUILT AROUND LEONARD 
LEONARD WAS POOR 
HE WAS IN THE MINORITY 
AND PATTY HEARST THOUGH WAS A VICTIM ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE STRINGS OF CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED THERE BUT SHE HAD MONEY 
AND SHE WAS WHITE AND SHE WAS FEMALE 
AND EVERYBODY FEELS THAT THE MEDIA WAS MORE SYMPATHETIC TO PATTY HEART 
ABSOLUTELY 
DO WE HAVE AGREEMENT ON THAT POINT HERE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
O. K. 
WE HAVE FROM TENNESSEE BACK ON THE LINE UNDERSTAND 
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT 
YES 
I HAVE A QUESTION AND A COMMENT 
ONE IS YOUR NOT ONLY THE MEDIA BUT YOUR SHOWS ON T. V. PORTRAY BLACKS IN TROUBLE ALWAYS 
UH HUH 
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU'VE GOT YOUR THIRTY MINUTE SHOWS THE COP SHOWS ALWAYS PORTRAYING A BLACK BEING ARRESTED AND MOTHERS LEAVING KIDS UNATTENDED 
AND ALSO MY QUESTION IS WHAT CAN WE DO IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN SCHOOL TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AND TEACHERS TO TEACH PEOPLE THAT THIS IS REALLY NOT TRUE 
THAT WE CAN PREVENT THINGS LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING AND WE SHOULDN'T LISTEN WE SHOULDN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT THE MEDIA SAYS 
MAKES A REALLY INTERESTING POINT TOO 
BECAUSE SHE'S TALKING NOT ONLY ABOUT NEWS PROGRAMMING BUT ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMMING 
LET ME ASK YOU ROBERT 
WHO DOES THE WORST JOB OF PORTRAYING MINORITIES 
THE NEWS OR ENTERTAINMENT 
WELL IT'S A CLOSE CALL BUT I WOULD SAY THE NEWS BECAUSE THE NEWS IS REAL AND PEOPLE KNOW IT'S REAL 
AND I THINK IT'S SCARY 
AND WHAT I WAS GOING IN RESPONSE TO THAT EARLIER CALLER 
SURE 
IS THAT THE NEWS DOESN'T AND ALSO WHAT BARBARA REYNOLDS SAID 
THE NEWS RARELY SHOWS SOLUTIONS 
IT SHOWS A WORLD OUT OF CONTROL IN WHICH NOTHING MUCH GOOD IS HAPPENING 
AND PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GRASP THE WORLD AND MAKE IT BETTER 
SO I THINK PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT GENERAL TENDENCY 
BUT AT LEAST IN ENTERTAINMENT I THINK YOU ACTUALLY GET A WIDER RANGE OF BLACKS DOING A WIDER RANGE OF THINGS THAN SOME OTHER MINORITIES ALTHOUGH I THINK OTHER MINORITIES ARE MORE IGNORED 
ALL RIGHT 
WELL I THINK ENTERTAINMENT IS EVEN WORSE 
YOU HAVE 
UH HUH 
SHOWS THAT ARE POSITIVE SHOWS LIKE ROC BEING TAKEN OFF THE AIRWAYS 
AND SHOWS THAT ARE NEGATIVE PROJECT BLACKS NEGATIVELY LIKE LAWRENCE ARE THAT STAYS ON 
YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY WHO REFUSE TO GIVE RECORD CONTRACTS TO GROUPS THAT AREN'T TALKING NEGATIVELY ABOUT WOMEN OR SWEARING OR THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO YOU HAVE A I THINK A SORT OF A DISEASE HERE AN INFECTION OF CERTAIN NEGATIVE IDEAS THAT YOU PEOPLE JUST SEEM TO HOLD 
ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK RIGHT HERE 
MORE ON RACE RACISM AND THE MEDIA WHEN SONYA LIVE CONTINUES 
WELCOME BACK TO SONYA LIVE 
WE'RE DISCUSSING RACE AND THE MEDIA 
BARBARA I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO YOU AND JUST ASK BE A LITTLE BIT OF A CYNIC IF I CAN AND SAY O. K. 
SO THE CONSENSUS HERE IS THE MEDIA'S BIASED 
SO WHAT 
WHOSE LIFE IS BEING AFFECTED HERE 
I THINK THE LIFE OF EVERY AMERICAN 
FIRST OF ALL WE OPERATE IN A DEMOCRACY 
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DEMOCRACY IF YOUR INSTITUTIONS AREN'T FREE 
THE MEDIA ARE THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD FREEDOM AND FAIRNESS 
IF WE AREN'T BEING FREE NOR FAIR WE ARE THE PUBLIC THE READERSHIP AND THE VIEWERSHIP 
FOR EXAMPLE IF I SAW ALL OF THE NEWS AND I LOOKED AT ALL OF THE AND ALL OF THE ANCHOR PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE REPORTERS AND ALL OF THE EDITORS WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IT MIGHT OCCUR TO ME THAT HMM 
I DON'T THINK WE DESERVE THAT 
WHY WHITE MALES CAN'T SEE THAT WE'RE HAVING A BROWNING OF AMERICA TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC THE POPULATION ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR 
AND OF COURSE I DON'T 
WE'VE GOT ONE 
I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THIS WORD MINORITY BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER LABEL THAT YOU PIN ON PEOPLE 
THE WORD MEANS INSIGNIFICANT AND SMALL 
WE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR 
ALL RIGHT 
NOT MINORITY PLAYERS 
ALL RIGHT 
WELL WE'VE GOT ONE WHITE MALE SITTING HERE WHO HAS DONE SOME STUDYING OF THIS ISSUE AND PERHAPS CAN SHED MORE LIGHT ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THE BIASES THAT YOU HAVE SEEN 
I HAVE I HAVE DONE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PEOPLE WHO RELY MORE ON LOCAL T. V. NEWS FOR THE FOR THEIR NEWS TEND TO BE MORE RACIALLY BIASED EVEN CONTROLLING FOR THEIR PARTISANSHIP AND IDEOLOGY AND SO FORTH 
SO YES IT IS HEIGHTENING RACIAL ANXIETY AND TENSION AMONG WHITE PEOPLE 
BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS IT IS IN WHITE PEOPLE'S TO BECOME MORE UNDERSTANDING AND EMPATHETIC WITH OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS 
ALL RIGHT 
LET ME ASK MY GUESTS IN ATLANTA FELIX GUTIERREZ FIRST OF ALL LET ME START WITH YOU 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE SETTLED AT THIS CONFERENCE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL CHANGE 
ANYTHING 
THE KEY THING IS THAT WE'RE NOT HERE AS ADVERSARIES TO THE MEDIA 
WE'RE PARTNERS WITH THE MEDIA 
WE'RE PART OF THE MEDIA 
I'VE BEEN IN JOURNALISM FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS NOW STARTED IN COLLEGE 
THIS IS PART OF MY PROFESSION 
THIS IS PART OF WHO I WANT TO BE PART OF 
AND I CAN BE AS MUCH A PART OF THE MEDIA AS THEY WILL ALLOW MY COMMUNITY TO BE IN 
WE STILL THOUGH SEE BLOCKAGES 
WE STILL THOUGH SEE THE GLASS CEILING 
AND IN TERMS OF THE BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE IT IS STILL FRAMED IN ISSUES BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND WHITES 
THE TRUE OF ASIAN AMERICANS LATINOS NATIVE AMERICANS WHICH IS WHERE THE GREATEST GROWTH POPULATION WISE IS COMING IS STILL NOT REFLECTED 
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE FIGURES THAT BARBARA MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WHO ARE COLUMNISTS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY 
AND IN TERMS OF NETWORK TELEVISION AND PRIME TIME VIEWING WE'RE STILL THE INVISIBLE MINORITY 
IT'S WE HAVE TRAINED AMERICA ESSENTIALLY IN BLACK AND WHITE 
AND THAT'S NOT WHERE AMERICA IS AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT WHERE AMERICA IS GOING 
PAUL IS THIS JUST JOURNALISTS BASHING JOURNALISTS 
OR DO YOU SEE ANY SIGNS THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE 
WELL I HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT I THINK TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE KIND OF CONVENTION THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN ATLANTA GEORGIA PROBABLY COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN PLACE 
IN FACT EVEN A FEW YEARS AGO IT NOT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE 
SO THIS IS POSITIVE MOVEMENT 
I THINK THAT YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNITED AT UNITY NINETY FOUR ON THE AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE SIMPLY ASKING JUST TO BE FULL PARTNERS IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND PORTRAYAL 
ALL RIGHT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK RIGHT HERE 
I'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT 
I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR GUESTS HERE IN NEW YORK TELEVISION PRODUCER RAY NUNN AND PROFESSOR ROBERT OF NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY 
FELIX GUTIERREZ IN ATLANTA 
ALSO PAUL PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL AMERICAN JOURNALIST ASSOCIATION 
AND U. S. A. TODAY COLUMNIST BARBARA REYNOLDS 
AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY 
JOIN ME AGAIN TOMORROW AS WE CONTINUE TO ASK WHY THINGS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE A LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM THE INSIDE OUT 
NOW WE GO TO BOBBIE BATTISTA FOR A LOOK AT WHAT'S AHEAD ON NEWSDAY
