THE WAR ON DRUGS 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO PUNISH THOSE WHO BRING DANGEROUS NARCOTICS ONTO AMERICA'S STREETS 
AS LAWMAKERS RACE TO JOIN THIS WAR THEY TALK TOUGH ABOUT LOCKING UP CRIMINALS WITH LONGER SENTENCES AND NO PAROLE 
IT'S A PRACTICE CALLED MANDATORY AND IT TAKES CHOICES ABOUT PUNISHMENT OUT OF THE HANDS OF JUDGES 
BUT AS SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT'S KEN BODE LEARNED WHILE THESE LAWS ARE GREAT POLITICS THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY 
WE'RE OUR SYSTEM 
I'VE SEEN YOUNGER AND YOUNGER PEOPLE COME IN WITH LONGER AND LONGER SENTENCES AND IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING 
THERE'S NO REHABILITATION THIS IS PUNISHMENT FOR SAKE 
BILL HART HAS SPENT FIVE YEARS IN THE FEDERAL PRISON AT PETERSBURG VIRGINIA 
A FIRST TIME NON VIOLENT OFFENDER SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS FOR OF COCAINE WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE 
HART WAS SENTENCED UNDER A MANDATORY MINIMUM LAW STRAIGHT TIME NO CHANCE FOR PAROLE 
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME BUT HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH HOW FAR MUST WE GO 
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME EVEN THIS FIVE YEARS TO LEARN THE LESSON 
MANDATORY SENTENCES DETERMINED PRECISELY AND SPECIFICALLY BY LAW NO LEEWAY FROM THE JUDGE AND NO PAROLE 
THESE WERE PASSED BY CONGRESS AIMED MAINLY AT DRUGS AND FIREARMS 
THEY WERE PART OF THE WAR ON CRIME OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
NOW PROSECUTORS POLICE PRISON OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL JUDGES ARE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT MANDATORY 
ARE THEY WORKING 
OR HAVE THEY CREATED MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY'VE SOLVED 
CRIME WAS PROMINENTLY ON THE PUBLIC AGENDA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
BASKETBALL STAR LEN BIAS DIED OF A COCAINE OVERDOSE WITHIN TEN MILES OF THE CAPITAL 
THE PUBLIC FUROR CREATED BY HIS DEATH SET CONGRESS ON A MANDATORY MINIMUM BINGE 
WE ENACTED ONE LAW AFTER ANOTHER EACH ONE TOUGHER THAN THE NEXT SO THAT THE MEMBER COULD SAY I'M REALLY TOUGH ON DRUG PEOPLE 
MANDATORY SENTENCES PART OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BINGE HAVE INDEED BEEN TOUGH ON DRUG OFFENDERS 
THE NUMBER OF INMATES IN FEDERAL PRISONS HAS DOUBLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
DRUG CASES ARE DRIVING THAT POPULATION EXPLOSION 
IN FACT SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF ALL OF THE INMATES IN OUR FEDERAL PRISONS ARE THERE ON DRUG RELATED OFFENSES 
AND THAT'S AN ASTOUNDING AMOUNT 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE THERE AT ALL 
THE JUDGE WHO'S SENTENCING THE PRISONER HAD NO DISCRETION AT ALL BUT TO GIVE THIS PERSON A NOT LESS THAN THREE FOUR FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS 
MORE THAN HALF THE INMATES WHO ARE IN FEDERAL PRISONS ON DRUG CHARGES ARE FIRST OFFENDERS 
MANY OF THEM SMALL FRY IN DRUG DEALS OR MARIJUANA GROWERS OR USERS 
ALL SENTENCED UNDER LAWS REQUIRING MANDATORY 
SOME SENIOR FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE REFUSED TO HANDLE DRUG CASES SAYING THAT THEIR HANDS ARE TIED BY LAWS THAT ARE UNFAIR COSTLY AND UNPRODUCTIVE 
ANOTHER VOICE AGAINST MANDATORY IS THE NATION'S CHIEF JUSTICE 
ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE EFFORTS HAS BEEN THE NEAR TRANSFORMATION OF SOME FEDERAL COURTS INTO WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED NATIONAL NARCOTICS COURTS 
BUT SENATOR PHIL GRAMM SAYS MANDATORY HAVE WORKED AND CONGRESS SHOULD LEAVE THEM ALONE 
I'M WILLING TO BUILD A PRISON CELL FOR EVERYBODY WHO IS OUT THERE TRYING TO SELL OUR CHILDREN DRUGS EVERYBODY WHO HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MY OWN MOTHER TO WALK AROUND THE BLOCK AT NIGHT 
SENATOR GRAMM GOT HIS WAY SO FAR
