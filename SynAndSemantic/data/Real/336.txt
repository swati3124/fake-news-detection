CURRENTLY AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE GATES THERE IS TALK NOW OF A LEGAL DEFENSE FUND OF SOME SORT 
WELL THE TALK COMES BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD SOME PRETTY SEVERE LEGAL FUNDS WITH THE PAULA JONES CASE AND WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL PROBE INTO WHITEWATER HE'S HAD TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY 
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT COULD GO AS HIGH AS ONE MILLION DOLLARS 
THE PRESIDENT ACCORDING TO SPECIAL ADVISER BRUCE LINDSEY IS NOT IN ANY FINANCIAL TROUBLE YET BUT THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING INTO WAYS TO SET UP A SPECIAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND 
THEY SAY IT IS LEGAL UNDER WHITE HOUSE RULES 
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL THE WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS HAVE LOOKED INTO THAT IT'S O. K. TO DO THAT BUT IF THEY DO THEY'D SET IT UP SPECIALLY SO THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T KNOW WHO GAVE MONEY TO THAT 
THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED TO DO IT YET BUT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT REID
