THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ESTIMATES THERE ARE FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE INFECTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS ABOUT THREE FOURTHS OF THEM THROUGH HETEROSEXUAL INTERCOURSE 
RECENT STUDIES SHOW MORE WOMEN ARE CHANGING THEIR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR TO AVOID CONTRACTING THE DISEASE MAINLY BY INSISTING THEIR PARTNER WEAR A CONDOM 
ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF THEM SAY THEIR PARTNER USES A CONDOM FREQUENTLY TEN PERCENT SAY EVERY TIME 
NOW A FEMALE CONDOM IS BEING MARKETED 
THE USERS SAY IT'S NOT PERFECT 
C. N. N.'S NORMA QUARLES HAS MORE IN OUR NEWS FROM MEDICINE 
NATAL A COLLEGE STUDENT IN NEW YORK WORRIES BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES AIDS IS NOW THE FOURTH LEADING OF DEATH IN WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY FOUR 
YOU GET VERY PARANOID AND YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO PROTECT YOURSELF AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE EXCEPT FOR ABSTINENCE 
SINCE SHE AND HER PARTNER DON'T WISH TO ABSTAIN SHE'S DECIDED TO BE AMONG THE FIRST WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES SAMPLING THE F. D. A. APPROVED FEMALE CONDOM 
IT COMES IN A PACKAGE LIKE THIS 
THEY'RE TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR ONE 
THEY'RE NOT REUSABLE 
I FIND THEM COMFORTABLE 
THE MATERIAL LOOKED STRONGER THAN THE MATERIAL THAT THE MALE CONDOM IS MADE OF AND THEREFORE I FELT MORE COMFORTABLE 
THE FEMALE CONDOM RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE F. D. A. IS SEEN AS A WAY FOR WOMEN TO EMPOWER THEMSELVES 
WOMEN UNTIL REALITY CAME OUT WITH THE FEMALE CONDOM HAD NO WAY TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES 
ALREADY IN USE IN EUROPE FEMALE CONDOMS WILL GET WIDER U. S. DISTRIBUTION IF THE F. D. A. APPROVES A MANUFACTURING PLANT IN GREAT BRITAIN 
IN THE MEANTIME FIFTY THOUSAND FEMALE CONDOMS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED AT HEALTH CLINICS IN THE UNITED STATES 
REACTION AT THIS AIDS CLINIC WAS MIXED 
WELL IT WASN'T A PROBLEM GETTING IT IN 
IT WASN'T REALLY A PROBLEM 
IT WAS GETTING IT OUT 
YOU JUST COULDN'T USE IT 
I HAVE TO CONVINCE MY HUSBAND TO USE THAT YOU KNOW BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT IT'S SO EXPENSIVE 
WELL MY PARTNER HE SAID THAT HE FELT LIKE HE WAS DOING IT WITH A GARBAGE BAG 
YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT 
I KNOW THIS IS NOT QUITE WHAT MANY WOMEN HOPED FOR 
I MEAN HOWEVER IN A SENSE IT IS A STEP FORWARD 
IN THE UNITED STATES WOMEN NOW ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND OF THE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES OF AIDS 
THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE MARRIED TO BISEXUAL MEN WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS 
THERE ARE ALSO WOMEN WHO ARE MARRIED TO MEN WHO ARE FORMER INJECTION DRUG USERS AND THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF THIS 
DESPITE ITS FLAWS THE FEMALE CONDOM IS THE FIRST DEVICE DESIGNED FOR WOMEN TO USE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST AIDS
