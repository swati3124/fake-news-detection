AN EXPLOSION IN LONDON THIS ONE OCCURRING IN GREEN NORTH OF LONDON 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM AS YET WHETHER IT WAS CAUSED BY A BOMB 
BAKER WHO IS A C. N. N. EMPLOYEE IN LONDON JOINS US ON THE TELEPHONE 
WHAT'S THE LATEST YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS 
WELL THE LATEST IS THAT THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE ARE TELLING C. N. N. THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED A CALL TO AN INCIDENT EARLIER THIS EVENING ABOUT AN HOUR AGO IN WHICH A CAR HAD EXPLODED IN THE NORTH AREA 
THIS IS NOT THE GREEN AREA AS INITIALLY WAS REPORTED 
AND POLICE HAVE CORDONED OFF THAT WHOLE AREA AND ARE SEARCHING FOR OTHER DEVICES 
IT IS NOT YET KNOWN YET WHAT THE MOTIVES ARE FOR THIS ATTACK AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER SERIOUS INJURIES PERHAPS NOT CERTAIN YET 
BUT THERE'S AT LEAST THREE CASUALTIES AND IT'S LATE AT NIGHT HERE BUT SIGNIFICANT NEVERTHELESS 
ANY IDEA WHAT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN IN THE AREA 
THE DAMAGE HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GOING IN ANY OF THE AREAS 
THEY'VE ALL BEEN CORDONED OFF AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF POLICE AND FIRE BRIGADES HAVE BEEN CALLED 
TWO PUMPS ARE THERE AND THREE INJURED TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL 
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE AREA FOR US 
IS IT PRIMARILY RESIDENTIAL 
IT'S A VERY RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT'S RIGHT 
IT'S IN THE HEART OF NORTH LONDON'S SUBURBS NORTH AND THERE IS VARYING COMMUNITIES THERE SOME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JEWISH COMMUNITY IN CENTRAL LONDON HERE BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL EXACTLY WHAT THE MOTIVATIONS WERE FOR THIS AND WHAT THE EXPLOSION ACTUALLY WAS 
SO DO THE POLICE HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE ANY LINKAGE PERHAPS TO THE EXPLOSION ON TUESDAY IN FRONT OF THE ISRAELI EMBASSY IN THE KENSINGTON DISTRICT 
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL 
THE INJURIES EARLIER ON TODAY SOME TWELVE OR THIRTEEN HOURS AGO CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN THE CENTER OF LONDON 
THIS IS IN THE PERIPHERY OF LONDON 
IT'S IN ONE OF THE NORTHERN SUBURBS AND AT THE MOMENT IT'S FAR TOO EARLY TO TELL 
BUT EVERYONE IS VERY CONCERNED BY THE INCIDENT AND THE WHOLE AREA'S ON A HEIGHTENED STATE OF SECURITY 
HOW ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED FARING 
AT THE MOMENT THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL AND THEY'RE IN SHOCK AND AT THE MOMENT IT SEEMS THAT IT'S FAIRLY MINOR AND THEY'RE HOPING THAT PEOPLE WILL BE RELEASED OVER NIGHT 
BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN TELL JUST HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS 
OKAY BAKER C. N. N. EMPLOYEE IN LONDON THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
