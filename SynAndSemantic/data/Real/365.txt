FROM THE FUTURE OF THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE PLAN TO A SHAKE UP OF HISTORICALLY THE MOST POWERFUL COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE WHAT WOULD BE THE REAL FALL OUT FROM A CONGRESS WITHOUT DAN ROSTENKOWSKI 
JOINING US FROM CAPITOL HILL WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS WISCONSIN REPUBLICAN JAMES AND MARYLAND DEMOCRAT BENJAMIN CARDIN 
GENTLEMEN THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
IT'S A PLEASURE 
CONGRESSMAN LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU 
ASSUMING THERE IS A PLEA BARGAIN WORKED OUT AND LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT THERE WERE WOULD THIS BE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION 
WELL I WOULD HOPE THAT IF THE PLEA BARGAIN INCLUDES A FELONY CONVICTION IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE RESIGNATION OF MR. ROSTENKOWSKI FROM CONGRESS 
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THAT 
FELONS DON'T BELONG IN CONGRESS AND WE'RE IN A BUSINESS WHERE A FEW BAD APPLES SPOIL THE WHOLE BARREL AND IF THERE IS A BAD APPLE IN THE BARREL I THINK CONGRESS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE A RESOLUTION OF EXPULSION PREPARED SO THAT IF MR. ROSTENKOWSKI IS A CONVICTED FELONY HE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
CONGRESSMAN CARDIN ARE YOU COMFORTABLE THAT A PLEA BARGAIN MAY BE BEING WORKED OUT OVER THIS WHOLE AFFAIR 
WELL I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAVE TO RESOLVE THIS 
MR. ROSTENKOWSKI'S ENTITLED TO HIS RIGHTS 
BUT HE'S ALSO EVERYONE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS 
SO I THINK WE SHOULD STAY OUT OF THIS AND LET THE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE JUDICIARY DO WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE JUST REALLY HAVE TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES AND WAIT 
IF THERE WERE A PLEA BARGAIN CONGRESSMAN CARDIN DO YOU BELIEVE ITS APPROPRIATE FOR THE FINAL ARRANGEMENT TO INCLUDE THE DISPOSITION OF WHETHER THAT CONGRESSMAN ROSTENKOWSKI REMAINS IN CONGRESS OR NOT 
I THINK A LOT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE PLEA BARGAIN IS ALL ABOUT OR HOW THIS ISSUE IS FINALLY RESOLVED 
THERE'S TWO ASPECTS HERE 
ONE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS AS FAR AS ANY CRIMINAL WRONGDOING AND THAT MUST BE HELD FULLY ACCOUNTABLE 
THE SECOND IS HOW OUR INSTITUTION NEEDS TO PROCEED 
AND WE THE MEMBERS OF THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE ARE FULLY PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE ISSUES AT HAND AND WE'LL DO THAT 
BUT I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO SEPARATE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN CONGRESS AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ANY INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING MR. ROSTENKOWSKI AS IT RELATES TO ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES 
CAN THAT BE DONE CONGRESSMAN 
CAN YOU SEPARATE THE TWO 
WELL I AGREE WITH MR. CARDIN THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE JUDICIAL PROCESS SHOULD ACT FIRST 
I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT THE LOOP WON'T BE CLOSED AND A VERY POWERFUL MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO WOULD ADMIT TO WRONGDOING AS A PART OF A PLEA BARGAIN WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE IN CONGRESS 
AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WON'T SIT STILL FOR THAT AND THAT'S WHY THE EXPULSION RESOLUTION HAS BEEN PREPARED TO CLOSE THE LOOP 
IF THERE WERE 
WE HAD PASSED A RESOLUTION BEFORE THE HOUSE THAT ASSUMED AS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS COMPLETED ITS WORK THE HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL TAKE UP THE POST OFFICE AND ANY ETHICAL VIOLATIONS 
SO SURE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
BUT ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE UNTIL THIS MATTER HAS BEEN HANDLED BY THE JUDICIARY 
WELL A PLEA BARGAIN IS DIFFERENT THAN EVEN A JURY VERDICT OF GUILT 
A PLEA BARGAIN A MEMBER OF CONGRESS ADMITS THAT HE DID WHAT IS ALLEGED IN THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
WE DON'T HAVE TO DELAY WITH AN EXTENSIVE ETHICS COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION 
THE CONGRESS OUT TO DO THE RIGHT THING IF THE PLEA BARGAIN DOES NOT REQUIRE THE MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO HAS PLEADED TO A FELONY TO RESIGN 
WELL YOU'RE ASSUMING WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE PLEA BARGAIN 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT 
BUT CONGRESSMAN CARDIN WHAT ABOUT HIS POINT THAT A PLEA BARGAIN IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF GUILT 
WELL IT DEPENDS WHAT HE'S PLEADING TO 
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE PLEA BARGAINING IS GOING TO INVOLVE 
OBVIOUSLY ONCE IF THERE IS A PLEA BARGAIN WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR CONGRESS TO TAKE AS AN ENTITY TO TAKE ACTION 
AND WE DON'T WANT TO RULE THAT OUT 
BUT I JUST THINK ITS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO SPECULATE UNTIL WE KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES HERE 
I GUESS WHAT I URGE IS THAT NO ONE'S ABOVE THE LAW 
THIS MATTER SHOULD BE HANDLED LIKE ANY OTHER MATTER AS FAR AS THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE CONCERNED 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONGRESS ITSELF AND TAKING ACTION AGAINST A MEMBER WE NEED TO KNOW THE FACTS FIRST BEFORE WE SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
CONGRESSMAN IF THE PLEA BARGAIN IF THERE WERE NO PLEA BARGAIN WORKED OUT AND IF THERE WERE AN INDICTMENT OF CONGRESSMAN ROSTENKOWSKI WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AT THAT POINT 
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN FROM YOUR STANDPOINT 
HE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE FORCED OUT AS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN PENDING THE TRIAL 
AND I DON'T ADVOCATE DOING ANYTHING UNTIL THE TRIAL IS OVER FOR TWO REASONS 
FIRST THE MEMBER IS PRESUMED INNOCENT UNTIL HE IS PROVEN GUILTY JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY AND SECOND THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE INDICTED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN FOUND INNOCENT INCLUDING THE CASE OF REPRESENTATIVE FORD OF TENNESSEE WHERE THE JURY FOUND HIM NOT GUILTY 
AND NOBODY SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF CONGRESS UNTIL THE JURY ACTUALLY MAKES A DETERMINATION OF GUILT 
CONGRESSMAN CARDIN I ASSUME YOU AGREE 
THAT'S CORRECT 
IN FACT WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN OUR ETHICS RULES TO DEFER UNTIL AFTER A CRIMINAL CASE HAS BEEN COMPLETED CASE HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN ORDER THAT THAT MATTER IS HANDLED FIRST 
WELL ALSO THE CONGRESS HAS GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT NO MATTER WHAT IT DOES IT DOES NOT ENGAGE IN PREJUDICIAL PRE TRIAL PUBLICITY THAT A DEFENSE ATTORNEY WOULD USE TO TRY TO GET A TRIAL MOVED OUT OF WASHINGTON TO SOMEPLACE ELSE OR TO DISMISS THE CHARGES ALTOGETHER ON THE BASIS THAT AN IMPARTIAL JURY CANNOT BE PICKED 
I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD GET INVOLVED IN INTERFERING WITH THE CRIMINAL PROCESS IF THERE IS A JURY TRIAL 
CONGRESSMAN CARDIN JUST QUICKLY WE HAVE LESS THAN A MINUTE 
MRS. CLINTON HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON SAID TODAY THAT IF CONGRESSMAN ROSTENKOWSKI WERE TO HAVE TO STEP ASIDE REMOVE HIMSELF FROM THIS PROCESS IT WOULD BE AN OBSTACLE BUT THAT HEALTH CARE REFORM WOULD STILL MOVE FORWARD 
IS SHE RIGHT ABOUT THAT 
OH I AGREE WITH HER COMPLETELY 
OUR COMMITTEE HAS MOVED FORWARD ON HEALTH CARE REFORM 
THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS ALREADY REPORTED OUT A BILL 
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE COMMITTED TO MEETING ANY DEADLINE WE NEED TO IN ORDER TO MOVE HEALTH CARE REFORM 
SO I AGREE WITH MRS. CLINTON 
CONGRESSMAN 
WELL THESE ISSUES ARE BIGGER THAN ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE CONGRESS WITH OR WITHOUT DAN ROSTENKOWSKI WILL ADDRESS ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE IT LIKE HEALTH CARE AND G. A. T. T. AND THE TAX QUESTIONS THAT GO BEFORE THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE 
IS THE REPUTATION OF THE HOUSE HURT BY THIS WHOLE THING GENTLEMEN JUST QUICKLY 
ANY TIME A MEMBER OF CONGRESS GETS IN TROUBLE ALL OF US GET HURT 
THE INSTITUTION AND THE MEMBERS WHO KEEP THEIR NOSES CLEAN AND ITS REALLY A VERY SAD DAY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS 
ALL RIGHT GENTLEMEN CONGRESSMAN CARDIN CONGRESSMAN WE THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH US 
THANK YOU 
BERNIE 
THANK YOU JUDY
