NEW JERSEY REGISTRATION HOTEL BRAVO CHARLIE 
ANOTHER FRIDAY NIGHT IN NEWARK NEW JERSEY 
AUTO SQUAD DETECTIVES RECORD ON A DASHBOARD MOUNTED VIDEO CAMERA THEIR HIGH SPEED CHASE OF ONE OF THE NATION'S LATEST HOODLUMS A A CRIMINAL WHO TAKES A CAR AWAY FROM ITS DRIVER BY FORCE 
POLICE SAY THERE ARE THIRTY TO FORTY CARJACKINGS A WEEK IN NEWARK 
THIS SUSPECT GETS AWAY 
NOT ALL ARE SO LUCKY 
AFTER CRASHING THE CAR HE HAD STOLEN FROM A WOMAN AT A THIS ONE TRIED TO ESCAPE ON FOOT 
POLICE CAUGHT HIM 
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CAR THIEVES 
TRADITIONALLY THEY'VE USED TOOLS TO STEAL PARKED CARS BUT THE ELEVEN MAJOR CITIES CONTACTED FOR THIS REPORT ARE SEEING A GROWING NUMBER OF ARMED ROBBERIES OF CARS 
THE TOOLS OF THIS TRADE ARE MOST OFTEN HIGH POWERED WEAPONS AND THESE MODERN DAY HIGHWAY ROBBERS ARE NOT AFRAID TO OR KILL TO GET THE CAR THEY WANT 
THE IN VOGUE THING TO DO IS TO TAKE A CAR AT GUNPOINT 
THAT HAS BECOME THE TREND 
IT'S FASHIONABLE 
LOU IS A TWENTY TWO YEAR VETERAN OF THE NEWARK POLICE DEPARTMENT 
WE'VE CONCEALED HIS IDENTITY TO PROTECT HIS UNDERCOVER WORK 
THE WAY I INTERPRET IT IS ANYBODY WHO DOES SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE IS A POTENTIAL MURDERER BECAUSE IF IT COMES TO PUSHING AND SHOVING HE'S GOING TO EITHER HAVE TO RUN AWAY OR PULL THE TRIGGER AND KILL THE PERSON 
AS HE WAS COMING UP I SEEN THE GUN AND HE JUST JUMPED UP SLAMMED THE GUN IN MY HEAD AND PULLED THE TRIGGER 
AND WHEN THE GUN WOULDN'T GO OFF WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE ME IN THE FACE AND THEN HE PUT THE GUN AGAIN AND HE PULLED THE TRIGGER A SECOND TIME 
LORETTA WAS ACCOSTED BY A LAST YEAR IN HER OWN DRIVEWAY IN A TOUGH NEWARK NEIGHBORHOOD 
AFTER THE GUN LORETTA SAYS SHE GOT ANGRY 
AND HE WAS STARTING TO LEAVE AND I GRABBED THE TOP THREW MY LEG UP ON HERE AND I JUST HELD ON FOR THE RIDE THIS WAY 
I HAD ONE FOOT UP ON THE TOP OF MY CAR ALMOST 
YOU WERE RIDING ON THE HOOD OF THIS CAR HANGING ON TO YOUR CAR 
WELL HANGING ON THE SIDE OF IT AND HE TOOK ME DOWN THE BLOCK MADE A RIGHT AND ALMOST TO THE END BY TWELFTH STREET IS WHERE I BROKE LOOSE 
HE FIRED A GUN AT YOUR HEAD TWO TIMES 
YES HE DID AND HE TRIED TO KILL ME AND I STILL WANTED TO IMPRESS UPON THIS MAN THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE THAT EASY 
DO YOU EVER LOSE SLEEP THINKING YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD 
NUMBER 
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME IS I HAVE RECURRING NIGHTMARES THE GUN CLICKING AND I WAKE UP IN A COLD SWEAT 
AND I GUESS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME 
WELL ONCE THEY SEE THE GUN THE EYES IS ON THE GUN AND WHATEVER YOU SAY WHATEVER YOU SAY GOES 
TWENTY YEAR OLD TUCKER IS NOT THE MAN WHO TOOK CAR BUT HE BEGAN STEALING CARS WHEN HE WAS TWELVE 
HE FITS THE PROFILE OF A A YOUNG MINORITY MALE FROM A POOR FAMILY LIVING IN AN INNER CITY NEIGHBORHOOD 
ADMITS TO AT LEAST TEN CARS 
YOU'LL CATCH THEM AT A AND YOU JUST APPROACH THEM 
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY STOPS IN FRONT OF THE CAR AND YOU GO TO THE DRIVER YOU GO TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE CAR AND TELL THEM TO GET OUT 
YOU KNOW YOU PUT ON THE ROUGHEST FACE THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY WHIP UP AND MAKE THEM GET OUT 
LOU THE POLICE DETECTIVE HAS SEEN OTHER METHODS USED IN CARJACKING 
WELL THEY HAVE THE FAKE ACCIDENT THE BUMP AND RUN THE BUMP AND ROB WHERE THEY'LL HIT THE BACK OF YOUR CAR 
THEY'LL COME UP BEHIND YOU AND HIT THE BACK OF YOUR CAR 
AND YOU'LL STOP PULL OVER TO GET THE INFORMATION ON THE DRIVER AND AT LEAST TO LOOK AT YOUR CAR IF NOTHING ELSE 
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT THEY TAKE YOUR CAR AND YOUR WALLET AND YOUR RINGS AND WATCH AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU HAVE OF ANY VALUE 
DID YOU FEEL GOOD WHEN YOU HAD THAT POWER OVER SOMEBODY 
FEEL REAL GOOD 'CAUSE THEN YOU GET RESPECT FROM YOUR PEERS 
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO SEE FEAR ON PEOPLE'S FACES WHEN YOU'D STEAL THEIR CARS AT GUNPOINT 
SOMETIMES IT WAS FUNNY 
YOU KNOW YOU REALLY COULD IF YOU WAS INTO IT YOU'D REALLY GET A KICK OUT OF IT 
OUT OF SEEING SOMEBODY FRIGHTENED TO DEATH 
SEEING SOMEBODY FLINCHING OR WHATEVER 
YOU REALLY GET A KICK OUT OF THAT 
ALL IT TAKES TO BE A IS A BAD ATTITUDE AND A GUN 
NEWARK POLICE CONFISCATED THESE WEAPONS FROM ARMED STREET ROBBERS INCLUDING CONVICTED 
SAYS WITH GUNS SO CHEAP AND ACCESSIBLE ON THE STREETS CAN TAKE ANY CAR THEY WANT FROM ALMOST ANYONE 
HEY IT CAN BE A ACTUAL VAN WITH TWELVE PEOPLE IN IT 
THEY SEE FOUR BLACK KIDS WITH FOUR GUNS THEY'RE GETTING OUT OF THE VAN THE QUICKEST WAY AS POSSIBLE COMING OUT THE WINDOWS PROBABLY TRYING TO MAKE A NEW DOOR 
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF CARJACKING 
IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO AVOID IT OR ANY POTENTIAL VICTIM CAN DO TO AVOID IT 
NOTHING YOU CAN DO 
THE RUSH IS ON 
AIN'T NO WAY YOU CAN GO BUT OUT THE CAR 
IT WAS A YEAR AGO IN BROAD DAYLIGHT 
I WAS AT THIS SHOPPING CENTER NEAR MY HOME IN SUBURBAN WASHINGTON D. C. 
I WAS GETTING OUT OF THE CAR TO LOAD MY GROCERIES IN THE TRUNK WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE A MAN APPEARED 
HE HAD A ZERO POINT NINE MILLIMETER SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL 
HE THREATENED TO BLOW MY HEAD OFF IF I DIDN'T COOPERATE 
I GAVE HIM MY PURSE AND MY CAR 
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER MY CAR WAS USED TO ROB A BANK WITH A HAND GRENADE 
I GOT THE CAR BACK FIVE DAYS LATER BUT I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO DRIVE IT AGAIN 
THE EXPERIENCE WAS TERRIFYING 
CARJACKING IS A GROWING CRIME IN THE WASHINGTON AREA BUT IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS 
THIS CITY HAS MORE LUXURY CARS AND MORE AUTO THEFTS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY 
ACCORDING TO THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND CARS STOLEN IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WERE TAKEN BY FORCE USUALLY AT GUNPOINT 
THAT'S AN AVERAGE TEN TO TWELVE CARJACKINGS A DAY 
POLICE SAY CARJACKINGS ARE ON THE RISE BECAUSE CAR THIEVES ARE HAVING MORE AND MORE TROUBLE THE COMPLICATED LOCKS AND SECURITY SYSTEMS ON MANY NEW CARS 
IT'S A LOT EASIER TO USE FORCE TO GET THE KEYS AWAY FROM THE OWNER AND SIMPLY DRIVE THE CAR AWAY 
THERE ARE TWO MAJOR REASONS CARS ARE JACKED 
THEY ARE USED TO COMMIT OTHER CRIMES OR STRIPPED AND SOLD FOR PARTS 
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT NISSAN OVER THERE THAT ONE THAT CAR WAS STOLEN FOR PARTS 
L. A. DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN SAYS ALTHOUGH ANYONE CAN BE A VICTIM OF CARJACKING CRIMINALS OFTEN TARGET SOME IN PARTICULAR 
IT'S DANGEROUS OUT THERE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF LONE FEMALES EXPENSIVE CARS EXPENSIVE JEWELRY AND THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE ION THE BIG CITY 
IT'S GETTING SLIGHTLY OUT OF CONTROL 
DETECTIVE FUHRMAN SAYS THE CRIME MAKES GOOD SENSE TO CRIMINALS 
YOU GO INTO A GROCERY STORY AND YOU ROB IT YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF TIME IN JAIL IF YOU GET CAUGHT PLUS YOU HAVE A LOT OF WITNESSES 
YOU TAKE A NINETY THOUSAND DOLLAR NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN PORSCHE AND TURN IT OVER FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR ABOUT TWENTY WORTH OF WORK YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME YOU'RE LOOKING 'CAUSE IT'S STILL A SECOND DEGREE ROBBERY AND VERY HIGH PROFIT AND YOU CAN DO QUITE A FEW OF THEM 
DO YOU THINK THE WORD IS OUT ON THE STREET 
I THINK THE WORD'S OUT IN PRISON 
I HAD A SPECIFIC CASE WHERE A MAN GOT OUT OF JAIL AND STARTED A BUMP AND ROB RING AS SOON AS HE GOT OUT 
HE TOOK STREET ROBBERS THAT WERE PURSES AND GETTING TWENTY DOLLARS AND HE WAS SHOWING THEM HOW TO MAKE THOUSANDS 
THE MAJORITY OF VICTIMS ARE NOT PHYSICALLY HARMED BUT TODD DOW WAS SHOT EVEN THOUGH HE GAVE UP HIS CAR 
HE WAS DRIVING A JEEP THROUGH AN AFFLUENT BLACK COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES WHEN HE WAS CONFRONTED AT A BY A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GUNMAN 
AND WHEN I LOOKED THERE WAS A GUN AND HE SAID GET OUT OR LOSE YOUR LIFE 
AND I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH THE GUY SO I GOT OUT 
AND WHEN I GOT OUT THE CAR I DON'T KNOW IT WAS JUST SOMETHING IN HIS EYES JUST LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT ME ANYWAY IT WAS LIKE HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT THROUGH ME LIKE HE DIDN'T CARE AND HE JUST SHOT ME 
THE BULLET PASSED THROUGH HIS ARM AND LODGED IN HIS SPINE AND TODD WAS TOLD HE WOULD NEVER WALK AGAIN 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOOT ME 
HE COULD HAVE TOOK THE CAR AND GONE ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BUT HE SHOT ME FOR NO REASON AND TOOK AWAY A PART OF MY LIFE THAT I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET BACK 
WITH DETERMINATION AND HARD WORK AND THERAPY TODD CAN WALK NOW WITH A BRACE BUT WITH DIFFICULTY 
HE LOST MOBILITY BUT TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD LOST HIS LIFE 
WHEN HE TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM A GANG OF HE WAS MURDERED IN A CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT 
POLICE TOLD HIS MOTHER CHERYL THAT THE GROUP OF TEENAGERS WANTED THE WHEELS ON HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HONDA CIVIC 
THEY FIRED ON HIM WITH A ZERO POINT NINE MILLIMETER GUN 
THEY FIRED CONTINUOUSLY 
THEY FIRED SO THAT EVERYONE IN THE SEVEN ELEVEN FELL TO THE FLOOR 
EVERYBODY WAS AFRAID TO COME UP AT ONE POINT 
THAT'S HOW GRUESOME IT WAS 
I WAS TOLD THAT AFTER THE SHOOTING THEY WALKED AWAY LAUGHING AND I WOULD ASK THEM IS THE JOY STILL GRATIFYING YOU KNOW DO THEY STILL FEEL HAPPINESS ABOUT THE DEPTH OF HURT THAT THEY HAVE CAUSED THIS FAMILY 
AFTER SPENDING THREE YEARS IN A JUVENILE DETENTION HOME FOR SELLING DRUGS TUCKER SAYS HE DOESN'T PLAN TO ANYMORE 
HE SAYS HE'S CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF HIS LIFE 
HE'S NOW ENROLLED IN A SPECIAL YOUTH PROGRAM AND WORKING ON HIS HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA 
I'LL PROBABLY SEE MYSELF COMING BACK YOU KNOW COMING BACK HERE AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING IN THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW 'CAUSE THIS IT'S LIKE YOU JUST GOT TO GIVE BACK YOUR DUES PAY YOUR DUES MAKE UP FOR THE WRONG THAT YOU MADE 
WHAT IF SOMEBODY WERE TO COME UP TO TODAY AND SAID LET'S GO STEAL A 
I SAY I SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK 
IT'S NOT REALLY OUT THERE 
ONCE YOU REALLY GET YOUR EYES OPEN IT'S NOT REALLY OUT THERE BUT A QUICK WAY TO DIE 
CAROLE WHAT ARE HIS CHANCES OF TURNING HIS LIFE AROUND DO YOU THINK 
WELL HUGH I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL BE ABLE TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND THE WAY HE WANTS TO BUT HE COMES FROM AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH HE'S PRETTY MUCH TRAPPED IN A SITUATION WHERE THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST HIM 
HE COMES FROM A BROKEN HOME HE COMES FROM AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE FEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES POOR SCHOOLS POOR HOUSING LOTS OF GUNS AND LOTS OF CRIME AND PEER PRESSURE FOR CRIME 
NOW THAT SITUATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOMEBODY MUST TURN TO A LIFE OF CRIME BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEE ANY STAKE IN THE FUTURE SOMETIMES DO TURN TO CRIME 
HE APPEARS TO SEE SOME FUTURE AND MAYBE 
THAT'S THE HOPEFUL SIGN RIGHT 
AS A RESULT OF YOUR HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WHAT TIPS WOULD YOU HAVE FOR PEOPLE DRIVING CARS TO AVOID BEING CARJACKED 
WELL THERE AREN'T MANY 
I MEAN SOMETIMES IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT 
BUT THE POLICE DO ADVISE TO KEEP YOUR WINDOWS ROLLED UP TO KEEP YOUR DOORS LOCKED 
WOMEN SHOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR PURSES ON THE FRONT SEAT OF THE CAR 
AND YOU SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYTHING AROUND YOU ALWAYS AWARE OF SUSPICIOUS PEOPLE AND SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR 
THEN IF YOU ARE STOPPED AND A GUNMAN DOES APPROACH YOU COOPERATE 
GIVE THEM THE CAR GIVE THEM YOUR VALUABLES 
THEY CAN BE REPLACED 
WELL IT'S A NEW AND NOT A HAPPY ONE BUT VERY INTERESTING AND THANK YOU CAROLE 
WELL LATER AN AMAZING WOMAN WHO ENGINEERED THE CAMPAIGN TO PUT ELVIS PRESLEY ON A STAMP 
BOB BROWN HAS HER STORY 
BUT FIRST A RARE LOOK INTO THE LIFE OF THE INFAMOUS IVAN WHO WENT TO JAIL FOR INSIDER TRADING 
FOR THE FIRST TIME HIS WIFE SPEAKS OUT 
HIS WALL STREET DEALINGS MADE HIM ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN AMERICA 
NOW WANTS ALIMONY FROM HIS WIFE 
WHY 
AND WHY IS SHE FINALLY TALKING
