NINETEEN NINETY THREE WAS A BANNER YEAR FOR STOCKS AND BONDS AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE SET SOME THIRTY RECORDS AND INTEREST RATES TUMBLED BUT BUYER BEWARE SOME SAY INVESTORS ARE POISED FOR A FALL 
WHERE SHOULD YOU PUT YOUR MONEY IN NINETY FOUR 
WE'LL ASK THE EXPERTS TONIGHT ON INSIDE BUSINESS 
WELCOME RISK AND REWARD THAT'S THE CLASSIC TRADE OFF FOR INVESTORS AND IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DECIDED TO ROLL THE DICE AND TAKE THEIR CHANCES ON STOCKS AND BONDS 
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS FUNNELED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO MUTUAL FUNDS AS THEY SOUGHT HIGHER RETURNS THAN THEIR LOCAL BANK COULD OFFER AND THAT HELPED PROPEL STOCKS TO RECORD HIGHS AND LONG TERM INTEREST RATES TO RECORD LOWS 
BUT WILL THE TURN OF THE NEW YEAR BE MORE SOBERING THAN FOR INVESTORS 
WHILE MANY EXPERTS SAY THIS BULL HAS JUST BEGUN OTHERS WARN OF TROUBLE AHEAD 
FORECASTING A TEN PERCENT DROP IN STOCK PRICES EARLY NEXT YEAR PUTS DAVID SHULMAN IN THE MINORITY ON WALL STREET 
WE THINK NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WILL BE A DIFFICULT YEAR FOR INVESTORS HARDER THAN THIS YEAR 
MORE ANALYSTS SOUND LIKE THIS 
I THINK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE STOCK PRICES MOVING HIGHER BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT IT WILL BE A VERY DRAMATIC YEAR FOR THE MARKET OVERALL 
THE WALL STREET CONSENSUS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN WHAT'S BECOME A CLICHE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC 
BUT A NUMBER OF WILD CARDS COULD DIVERT THE THAT HAS CARRIED STOCKS TWELVE PERCENT HIGHER THIS YEAR 
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST ONE IS INTEREST RATES 
IF THE ECONOMY STARTS TO GROW MORE QUICKLY AND INFLATION HEATS UP RATES WILL HEAD HIGHER 
THAT COULD SIPHON OFF THE FLOW OF FUNDS INTO STOCKS THAT'S HELPED PROPEL THE DOW INDUSTRIALS TO SUCCESSIVE RECORDS 
ANOTHER WILD CARD THE INVESTORS THEMSELVES 
SMALL INVESTORS CAME BACK INTO THE MARKET IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN FORCE AND THAT WORRIES SOME ANALYSTS WHO SAY THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO DUMP SHARES AT THE SLIGHTEST VOLATILITY 
BUT TALK OF A BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME AND SO FAR STOCKS ARE STILL AT RECORD HIGHS 
I THINK INVESTORS RATHER THAN JUMPING OFF THE SHIP SHALL WE SAY AS TIME HAS GONE ONE THEY'VE SORT OF ADJUSTED TO THESE WORRIES AND THESE SCARES AND SAY LOOK SHOW ME 
SHOW ME SOMETHING THAT'S CHANGED 
THEN I'LL SELL 
UNTIL THEN MOST ANALYSTS ARE LOOKING FOR STILL MORE MONEY TO FLOW INTO THE STOCK MARKET IF ONLY BY DEFAULT 
WITH BANKS PAYING THE LOWEST RATES IN YEARS THERE AREN'T A LOT OF ALTERNATIVES 
WHEN WE COME BACK I'LL BE TALKING WITH TWO INVESTMENT STRATEGISTS ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR NINETEEN NINETY FOUR MICHAEL METZ FROM OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY AND RONALD HILL OF BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN 
STAY WITH US 
WELCOME BACK TO INSIDE BUSINESS 
BY SOME ACCOUNTS THIS IS THE LONGEST BULL RUN OF THE CENTURY 
CAN THE GOOD TIMES CONTINUE OR IS THIS BULL GETTING A LITTLE OLD 
JOINING ME NOW WITH THE INVESTMENT OUTLOOK FOR NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND A TAKE ON NINETEEN NINETY THREE ARE MICHAEL METZ HE IS CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST OF OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY AND RONALD HILL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST FROM BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN 
WELCOME BOTH OF YOU 
THANK YOU 
NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE HAVE A BULL AND A BEAR HERE 
RON HOW BULLISH ARE YOU 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC HERE 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC O. K. 
YES LET'S ADMIT THE MARKET'S HAD A NICE RUN 
WE'RE IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF A BULL MARKET 
WE ONLY HAVE ONE OF THOSE ON RECORD SINCE WORLD WAR TWO THAT WAS EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN AND SO AT HIGH LEVELS OF P. SLASH E. RATIOS LOW LEVELS OF DIVIDEND YIELD YOU DON'T WANT TO EXPECT TOO MUCH BUT STILL LIKE THE LONG TERM AVERAGE NINE TEN PERCENT TOTAL RETURN BASIS ON THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED PROBABLY A LITTLE BETTER ON THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS FOR NINETEEN NINETY FOUR LOOKS DOABLE TO US 
O. K. WHAT ABOUT YOU MICHAEL 
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT DO YOU 
NO I DON'T 
I THINK AS THEY SAY IN THE BEER COMMERCIALS IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS 
I THINK WE'VE HAD THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS LOW INFLATION LOW INTEREST RATES AND ORDERLY BUSINESS RECOVERY 
I THINK BOTH BOND AND STOCK MARKETS PEAKED IN OCTOBER 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
TRANSLATE THAT INTO NUMBERS FOR ME 
WHAT IS A DIFFICULT NINETEEN NINETY FOUR MEAN 
WELL DIFFICULT THAT'S THE EUPHEMISM FOR DOWN 
I THINK IF YOU'RE AN YOU'LL LOSE MONEY IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
ANY IDEA HOW MUCH 
ENOUGH TO BE PAINFUL I'D SAY 
MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN PERCENT ON THE DOWN SIDE DURING THE YEAR 
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD CORRECTION 
ALL RIGHT YOU OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE RATHER SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE OUTLOOK 
LET ME ASK IF WE AGREE AT LEAST ON THE SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
AM I RIGHT IN SAYING THAT WHAT WE SAW WAS LIQUIDITY 
WE SAW LOW INTEREST RATES DRIVING PEOPLE INTO THE STOCK MARKET AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT INTO BONDS AS WELL 
IS THAT CORRECT MICHAEL 
I THINK BASICALLY THAT IS THE STORY AND THE REAL QUESTION FOR NINETY FOUR IS WHETHER THAT URGENCY TO GET HIGHER YIELDS FROM STOCKS CONTINUES AND IN MY JUDGMENT WE'VE SEEN THE LOW IN INTEREST RATES FOR A VARIETY OF FACTORS AND AS INTEREST RATES MOVE UP PARTICULARLY IN THE LOAN SECTOR I THINK THAT URGENCY TO JUMP INTO STOCKS WANES AND I THINK THE STOCK MARKET WILL SUFFER FROM MALNUTRITION 
IT WON'T GET THAT MUTUAL FUND INFLOW 
DO YOU THINK THAT INTEREST RATES ARE HEADED BACK UP 
WELL I THINK I WOULD LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION WHICH IS SHORT TERM MONEY MARKET RATES 
THE MONEY THAT'S COMING INTO THE STOCK MARKET BEING DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY PEOPLE EXITING THE C. D. MARKET BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T LIVE WITH TWO AND ONE HALF TO THREE PERCENT RETURNS FROM THEIR BANK 
I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING ANY TIME SOON 
THE LOAN DEMAND REMAINS LOW 
THE BANKS DO NOT NEED MONEY 
THERE IS NO LOAN DEMAND 
UNTIL YOU GET A REALLY STRONG ECONOMY AND THE BANKS WANT TO BID UP FOR YOUR DEPOSITS THEY'RE STILL GOING TO PAY YOU TWO AND ONE HALF TO THREE PERCENT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET FED UP WITH THAT 
SO IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR YOU DON'T THINK AMERICANS HAVE ANY INCENTIVE TO PUT THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK ANYMORE THAN THEY DID IN NINETY THREE 
NOT AT THE OUTSET THEY CERTAINLY DON'T 
ACTUALLY YOU SAW A LOW POINT IN COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL LOAN DEMAND ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO 
IT'S STARTING TO PICK UP 
ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS THAT LONG TERM RATES WENT DOWN IS THAT BANKS ACCUMULATED BOND POSITIONS TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE IN HISTORY 
IF YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE BANKING FIGURES THAT ACCUMULATION ENDED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO 
I THINK YOU'RE SEEING A SWITCH 
SO AM I CORRECT WHAT YOU'RE BOTH SAYING TO ME IS THAT YOU THINK INTEREST RATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WILL REMAIN LOW UNLESS AND UNTIL THE ECONOMY REALLY TAKES OFF 
NO THAT'S NOT MY VIEW 
I THINK INTEREST RATES HAVE SEEN THEIR LOW 
NO 
I THINK THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS LONGER TERM RATES 
I THINK SHORT RATES WILL PROBABLY EDGE UP A LITTLE BIT ALTHOUGH MY GUESS IS THE FED WILL PROBABLY PUSH SHORT RATES UP IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THE BOND MARKET LONG TERM 
ALL RIGHT SO SHORT RATES ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE MUCH 
WHERE YOU SEE THE BIGGEST CHANGE COMING IS IN THE LONG TERM END OF THE MARKET 
THAT'S CORRECT 
BUT THAT'S AN INFLATION SENSITIVITY ARGUMENT AND RIGHT NOW LET'S FACE IT METALS PRICES AND THE ECONOMY ARE LOOKING QUITE STRONG BUT THEY LOOKED WONDERFUL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR ALSO ONLY TO GET BY A VERY WEAK FIRST QUARTER FOLLOWING 
AND I THINK YOU HAVE A VERY REAL PROBABILITY THAT THE FIRST QUARTER OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IS GOING TO BE A LOT WEAKER THAN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND THAT AGAIN TAKES A LOT OF PRESSURE OFF THAT 
IT PROBABLY TAKES AWAY SOME OF THAT INFLATION ARGUMENT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MIKE 
NO I THINK THE MOVE IN INDUSTRIAL COMMODITY PRICES IS FOR REAL 
THE MAJOR INFLUENCE HAS BEEN LIQUIDATION FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES 
I THINK THAT'S RUN ITS COURSE 
MICHAEL WHAT ABOUT OIL PRICES 
THEY'VE BEEN GOING DOWN 
THAT HELPS PRODUCE DEFLATION 
YES BUT MY POINT ON THERE IS THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY AT THE BOTTOM FOR OIL PRICES AND THAT'S ALREADY HAD IT'S INFLUENCE 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK THE OTHER WAY IN NINETY FOUR 
SO YOUR SENTIMENT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A BIT OF INFLATION COMING AND THAT'S GOING TO PUSH LONG TERM RATES UP 
YES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I'D SAY THIS 
FOR THE MARKET TO GO HIGHER YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE FLAT INFLATION HAVE TO HAVE LOWER INFLATION 
IN MY OPINION IT DOESN'T GET LOWER 
RON 
I THINK FOR THE MARKET TO MOVE HIGHER YOU NEED TO HAVE STABLE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND RISING EARNINGS WHICH I DO FORESEE BECAUSE I SEE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKING UP 
WHAT I THINK IS REALLY CRUCIAL IS THAT THE NOMINAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DOESN'T IMPROVE THAT MUCH 
IT'S JUST THAT THE MIX GETS BETTER 
THERE'S MORE REAL GROWTH LESS INFLATION IN COMPONENTS THERE 
THEREFORE I THINK THE FED DOESN'T MOVE BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY I THINK ON THE NOMINAL GROWTH RATE IN THE ECONOMY 
ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE YOU THINK THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUSHING INTEREST RATES HIGHER AT THE SHORT END 
NUMBER 
I THOUGHT I HEARD A POINT OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU THERE ON ONE THING PART OF WHAT'S BEEN DRIVING THE STOCK MARKET UP IS INDIVIDUALS PUTTING THEIR MONEY INTO MUTUAL FUNDS CHASING HIGHER YIELDS THAN THEY CAN GET AT THE BANK 
WHAT KIND OF INVESTORS ARE THESE INDIVIDUALS 
ARE THEY LONG HAUL PLAYERS MIKE OR ARE THEY NERVOUS 
THAT'S THE TRILLION DOLLAR QUESTION 
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM WERE NEVER IN THE MARKET BEFORE AND THEY'RE IN THERE BECAUSE OF YIELD 
SO I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS DO THEY PANIC OR CHANGE THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGY OR THEIR ASSET PREFERENCES IF THEY SENSE THAT INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP 
I THINK THAT DOES HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S A MAJOR POTENTIAL NEGATIVE 
SOMETHING THAT COULD HASTEN THE CORRECTION 
I THINK IT WOULD IT 
MAKE IT HAPPEN FASTER IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF DAYS 
THAT'S RIGHT YES 
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A CRASH HERE 
NO BUT I THINK WE ARE CAUGHT 
I FRANKLY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A MINI CRASH IN THE BOND MARKET 
I THINK TREND FOLLOWERS THERE INCLUDING BANKS HIGHLY LEVERAGED POSITIONS BY INDIVIDUALS WILL SENSE THE DIRECTION OF LONG TERM RATES AS UP AGAIN AND I THINK YOU COULD SEE A REALLY DEEP DEEP CORRECTION IN THE BOND MARKET VERY QUICKLY 
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR REALLY A CORRECTION IN STOCK OR BONDS TOO MUCH RON BUT LET ME ASK YOU IF YOU THINK THESE ARE A BUNCH OF NERVOUS FIRST TIME EQUITY MARKET INVESTORS OUT THERE 
I DIDN'T USE THOSE TERMS 
YOU DIDN'T USE THEM 
I USED THEM 
I THINK THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT USED TO OWNING EQUITIES THAT IS CORRECT 
HOWEVER THEY ARE BEING FORCED INTO EQUITIES AND LONGER TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE LONGER 
THEY'RE LEARNING I THINK THROUGH FOUR OH ONE K. PLANS THROUGH DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS THAT THEY MUST MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS FOR THEIR INVESTMENT HORIZON AND WE LIVE LONGER NOW AND THE FACT IS YOU CAN'T GO TO BONDS AT SIXTY AND EXPECT AT EIGHTY FIVE TO HAVE ANY KIND OF LIFESTYLE RELATIVE TO WHAT YOU EXPECTED WHEN YOU DID THAT 
DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW PUTTING MONEY IN MUTUAL FUNDS FOR THE FIRST TIME REALIZE THIS 
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE IN THERE FOR THE LONG HAUL OR THEY'RE GOING TO YANK THEIR MONEY OUT AT THE FIRST SIGN OF ANY TROUBLE 
THERE WILL BE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WILL YANK THEIR MONEY BUT I THINK THERE'S A MAJOR PORTION OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FOR THE LONG HAUL AND REMEMBER A LOT OF THAT MONEY WHICH IS FLOWING IN THROUGH FOUR OH ONE K. PLANS CANNOT BE ANYWAY IN A SENSE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET AT IT UNTIL YOU'RE FIFTY NINE AND ONE HALF AT A MINIMUM 
SO I THINK THAT THERE IS AN INCENTIVE THERE TO STAY LONGER TERM FOR SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AND ALSO REMEMBER AS LONG AS INFLATION STAYS LOW OWNING HARD ASSETS DOESN'T REALLY DRIVE UP YOUR NET WORTH QUITE AS MUCH AS IT HAS IN THE PAST IN THE EIGHTY'S FOR EXAMPLE 
AND SO WE'RE GOING FROM A REGULAR LOW POINT OF OWNERSHIP OF EQUITIES UP TO I THINK A LEVEL THAT'S MORE LIKE WE SAW IN THE SIXTY'S 
ONE FACT I'D LIKE TO BRING OUT IS ACCORDING TO THE S. E. C. SURVEYS OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS FULLY A THIRD OF THEM THINK THAT THEIR MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
THIS TO ME IS A TERRIFYING STATISTIC 
IF YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE MARKET'S DIRECTION THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR A RUDE AWAKENING 
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING STOCKS REALLY DON'T KNOW THE RISKS INVOLVED IN IT 
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREAK ON THAT NOTE RIGHT HERE 
WHEN INSIDE BUSINESS RETURNS I'M GOING TO TALK TO MY GUESTS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL NOT YOURS BUT YOUR MONEY'S 
STAY WITH US 
WELCOME BACK TO INSIDE BUSINESS 
WE'RE DISCUSSING THE INVESTMENT OUTLOOK FOR NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
I WANT TO ASK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 
MICHAEL IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR A TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT CORRECTION IN THE STOCK MARKET IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE ON THE REAL ECONOMY 
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION VERY DIFFICULT ONE TO ANSWER 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE IMPACT OF THE MARKET DECLINE ON THE REAL ECONOMY WAS NIL BECAUSE THE TRAUMA REALLY WAS RESTRICTED TO A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND MARGIN PLAYERS 
MY POINT IS TODAY YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE A WEALTH EFFECT WHO WILL FEEL POOR IF THE MARKET GOES DOWN SO MY FEELING IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE MARKET WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CONSUMER DEMAND IN THE REAL ECONOMY 
RON DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
TO GET TO YOUR DECLINE THOUGH WE'D HAVE TO HAVE RISING INFLATION WHICH MEANS THE VALUE OF OUR HOMES WOULD GO UP AGAIN WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE KEY IN EIGHTY SEVEN BECAUSE HOUSE PRICES DIDN'T COLLAPSE AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAD OUR SENSE OF REAL NET WORTH AND CONSUMPTION ACTUALLY PULLED BACK AS HOUSING PRICES CAME DOWN MORE THAN ANY STOCK CORRECTION 
BUT YOU COULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT PEOPLE FEEL LESS GOOD ABOUT THE VALUE OF THEIR HOUSES NOW AND THEY FEEL LIKE MORE OF THEIR FUTURE'S TIED UP IN THEIR PORTFOLIO 
BUT IF YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE YOUR HOUSE ROLL UP AGAIN IN PRICE I THINK YOU KNOW YOU BEGIN TO FEEL 
RON YOU CAN HAVE INFLATION WITHOUT HOUSE PRICES GOING UP 
SO YOU'RE BULLISH ON REAL ESTATE 
YOU'RE SAYING MAYBE SKIP THE STOCK MARKET AND BUY A HOUSE 
NO ONLY IF HIS SCENARIO COMES TRUE 
O. K. WHAT IS YOUR SCENARIO 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR STOCKS TO APPRECIATE MODESTLY 
WHAT DID YOU SAY MAYBE NINE TEN PERCENT ON THE S. AND P. A LITTLE BETTER ON THE DOW 
RIGHT 
IF THAT HAPPENS DO A LOT OF PEOPLE GET WEALTHIER AND SPEND MORE MONEY 
THEY DON'T 
IT'S LIKE THIS YEAR 
IT DOESN'T FEEL TREMENDOUSLY GETTING RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS YOU KNOW NINE TEN PERCENT IS NOT A SPECTACULAR GOLLY I MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET THIS YEAR KIND OF FEELING 
WHAT IT IS IS I MADE MORE MONEY THAN I MADE IN CASH AND I FEEL A LITTLE BETTER 
O. K. ONE PLACE WHERE THE STOCK MARKET'S RUN UP IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE HELPED THE REAL ECONOMY IS IT MADE IT EASIER FOR A LOT OF BUSINESSES TO RAISE MONEY WITH INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS 
RON DO YOU THINK THAT GIVEN YOU'RE A LITTLE BULLISH ON THE STOCK MARKET HERE THE PACE OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS WILL CONTINUE 
WE'VE DONE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR NET HERE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
WE DID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OUT FROM EIGHTY THREE TO EIGHTY NINE 
SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING A LOT OF EQUITY WE TOOK OUT OF THE MARKET IN THE EIGHTY'S 
SO I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY MORE TO GO AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A NEGATIVE 
AND YOU THINK THERE'S AN APPETITE OUT THERE 
PEOPLE WILL THE STUFF UP 
AND ALSO WE'RE REPLACING EXPENSIVE DEBT FOR CHEAP EQUITY WITH CHEAP EQUITY FOR 
AND WE'RE REPLACING CHEAP STOCK WITH VERY OVERPRICED STOCK IN I. P. O.'S 
O. K. I HEAR SEEDS OF DISAGREEMENT HERE 
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME 
NO BUT THE I. P. O. MARKET IS REALLY A FUNCTION OF GENERAL EUPHORIA AND GENERAL MARKET LEVELS 
IF I'M CORRECT AND THERE'S A VAGUE CHANCE I MIGHT BE THAT THE MARKET GOES DOWN IN NINETY FOUR YOU'LL SEE THAT I. P. O. MARKET DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY AND BY THE WAY I THINK THE BIG DISASTERS OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR ARE GOING TO BE THE I. P. O.'S OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
REALLY YOU THINK SO 
YES 
THOSE STOCKS ARE GOING TO SUFFER THE MOST IN THE DIRECTION YOU ANTICIPATE 
INDEED A LOT OF THEM WERE FAD STOCKS A LOT OF THEM IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS OTHER AREAS HAD NO EARNINGS NO DIVIDENDS NO REAL BUSINESSES 
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISASTERS 
THE HIGH STOCK PRICES IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE RISE IN STOCK PRICES ALSO FUELED A BIT OF A BOOM IN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY 
BRIEFLY MICHAEL DO YOU SEE THAT CONTINUING 
OH YES AND IT'S TAKEOVERS FOR STOCK RATHER THAN CASH 
AND YOU THINK THAT'LL CONTINUE IN NINETY FOUR EVEN IF THE MARKET GETS CORRECTED 
YEAH THERE'S AN INDUSTRIAL RATIONALE FOR IT I THINK IT DOES CONTINUE 
YOU AGREE SO WE CAN SEE THE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS PEOPLE THE INVESTMENT BANKERS CAN BE HAPPY ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR NINETY FOUR AT LEAST 
LET ME TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL INVESTING 
THE BIG INTERESTING STORY THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE TUMBLING OF THE TOKYO STOCK MARKET 
THERE'S BEEN A REAL RADICAL DROP THERE 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AFFECTED ECONOMIES MUCH IN THE REST OF THE WORLD 
ARE AMERICANS VERY EXPOSED TO WHAT HAPPENS IN TOKYO AND DOES IT HAVE ANY FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICANS OR ANYBODY ELSE 
I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY REAL IMPACT FOR OUR MARKET 
THE BIG QUESTION MARK IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE CAPITAL AND SELL THEIR HOLDINGS HERE 
I THINK THEY'RE SELLING THEY'RE REAL ESTATE HERE MAKING THE BOTTOM PERHAPS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE MAJOR NEGATIVE NO 
RON 
THEY'VE ALREADY SOLD MOST OF THE BOND HOLDINGS AS WELL AND I THINK THE STOCK HOLDINGS ARE MORE LONGER TERM FROM THE PEOPLE I TALK TO IN JAPAN 
SEEING BIG RALLIES IN EUROPEAN MARKETS 
IS THAT GOING TO SIPHON A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF THE U. S. 
IT HAS ALREADY 
BUT FRANKLY MY GUESS IS WE'RE SYNCHRONIZED FOR A WORLD WIDE MAJOR CORRECTION BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF NINETY FOUR 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT TOO 
IN EUROPE AND SOUTHEAST IN MY GUESS YES 
RON 
I STILL THINK THERE'S PROBABLY ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED BASIS POINTS TO GO ON GERMAN INTEREST RATES ON THE DOWN SIDE 
EUROPE FLOATS UP ON LIQUIDITY AND I THINK STAYS UP ON THE BASIS OF SECULAR GROWTH 
WE HAVE ONLY A FEW SECONDS REMAINING 
MICHAEL FIRST YOU AND THEN RON YOU 
WHAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU EXPECT 
GOLD STOCKS I THINK GOLD WILL SELL AT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN OUNCE IN NINETY FOUR UNLESS IT DOESN'T 
UNLESS IT DOESN'T HERE'S A HEDGE 
WHAT ABOUT YOU RON 
I THINK SENSITIVE STOCKS TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALSO SOMETHING TO DO WITH COMPUTERS ET CETERA 
VERY DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS VERY DIFFERENT BETS 
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE YOU BACK IN A FEW MONTHS AND SEE WHO WINS 
IF WE'RE STILL EMPLOYED 
OH YOU'LL STILL BE EMPLOYED I'M SURE 
THE REST OF US WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH MICHAEL METZ FROM OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY AND ALSO RON HILL FROM BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN 
INSIDE BUSINESS WILL RETURN IN JUST A MOMENT WITH A LOOK AT THE BEST AND WORST PERFORMING MUTUAL FUNDS OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE
