NEW COMPUTERS OFFER FAITHFUL ELECTRONIC SERVANTS THAT CAN HANDLE MORE AND MORE TASKS ON THEIR OWN 
BUT COULD THEY TURN AGAINST THEIR MASTERS 
ALSO THE OLD FAMILIAR EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM IS ABOUT TO GET A HIGH TECH REPLACEMENT THAT WILL GET THE WORD OUT TO MORE PEOPLE IF THEY'RE IN DANGER 
AND SOME TEACHERS WHO MAKE SCIENCE AND MATH CLASSES EXCITING GET CREDIT FOR IT THIS WEEK 
THOSE STORIES AND MORE ARE JUST AHEAD 
HELLO I'M MILES O'BRIEN 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T SURFING IN CYBERSPACE THERE IS A DIGITAL REVOLUTION UNDERWAY AND IT'S ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN COMPUTERS 
IT'S ABOUT THE WAY WE PERCEIVE THE MACHINES AND THE PEOPLE WHO USE THEM 
IT'S A REVOLUTION IN COMPUTER CULTURE 
THEY ARE NERDS BUT THEY'RE HIP AND THEY'RE PROUD 
DIAL IN AND LOG ON 
THE DIGITAL GENERATION HAS HIT ITS STRIDE AND FOUND ITS VOICE AND IT IS WIRED 
WIRED IS VANITY FAIR FOR PROPELLER HEADS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO WISH THEY'D BEEN PROPELLER HEADS BUT PROBABLY WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH AT MATH IN COLLEGE 
WHERE COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS AND THE MEDIA CONVERGE SO CALLED MULTIMEDIA YOU'LL FIND WIRED MAGAZINE 
IT HAS BECOME THE MONTHLY MANIFESTO OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
SUDDENLY IT SEEMS IT IS CHIC TO BE A COMPUTER GEEK 
HAS GONE FROM BEING A CULT TO BEING A CULTURE 
THEY BECOME THE CULTURE 
THE CULTURE OF AMERICA TODAY IS THE GEEK CULTURE OF TEN YEARS AGO 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AT WIRED IS PROOF THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TO THIS 
A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER THE FIRST ISSUE CIRCULATION IS A QUARTER OF A MILLION ADVERTISERS ARE IN LOVE AND TOP WRITERS ARE ON THE 
WE'VE TAPPED INTO SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE REALIZED WAS MISSING 
CO FOUNDERS JANE AND LOUIS RUN WIRED FROM A CONVERTED WAREHOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO BRIMMING WITH TWENTY SOMETHING DIGITAL 
THE SUCCESS OF WIRED REFLECTS AN ATTITUDE IN CULTURE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS THAT IT IS NOT LONGER THE REALM OF EITHER THE SUPER EDUCATED OR YOU KNOW THE SUPER 
NOT LONG AGO COMPUTERS WERE CLOSETED AWAY IN CLIMATE CONTROLLED ROOMS AND COMPUTER USERS WELL REVENGE OF THE NERDS COMES TO MIND 
HEY TAKE IT EASY 
THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND 
TODAY COMPUTERS HAVE COME OUT OF THE CLOSET PLUGGED INTO A GLOBAL NETWORK AND ALONG THE WAY MADE A MUCH WIDER CIRCLE OF FRIENDS 
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SAY HEY WOW THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON AND THAT CAN BE REALLY COOL 
TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT AND GET INVOLVED 
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT REAL MAYBE AS MUCH AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE 
THERE ARE OTHER CLUES TO THIS CYBER SEA CHANGE 
JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE OFFICES OF WIRED MAGAZINE HERE ON THE EDGE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MULTIMEDIA DISTRICT DURING A LUNCH HOUR YOU CAN SEE THE PEOPLE WITH THE CREATIVE VISION FOR THIS EMERGING INDUSTRY LOOK A LOT MORE LIKE ARTISTS THAN ENGINEERS PEOPLE LIKE JUST STARTING IN A MULTIMEDIA COMPUTER COMPANY 
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE SO INTERESTED IN COMPUTERS 
USED TO BE THE DOMAIN OF NERDS 
YES 
NOW YOU SAID IT WAS WHAT 
IT'S HIP 
IT'S VERY HIP 
CHECK OUT THE SCENE DOWN THE STREET 
AT THIS COFFEE HOUSE COMPUTER CONVERSATIONS AND GO HAND IN HAND FOR PEOPLE LIKE TURNER MORGAN 
IS IT CHIC TO BE A GEEK 
YEAH IT'S GETTING THERE 
I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE HUNDREDTH MONKEY THEORY 
AFTER A WHILE WE REACH THE HUNDREDTH MONKEY AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT WAS O. K. TO HAVE A COMPUTER AND TO TALK ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER 
AND TALK TO PAUL 
WE ABSOLUTELY ARE A VERY WIRED PLUGGED IN BAND 
HIS GROUP WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT COMPUTERS 
THEY USE THEM TO CREATE VIDEOS AND E. MAIL THEIR FANS SO CALLED WITH A SENSE OF STYLE 
YOU'LL FIND THEM AT FRENETIC DANCE PARTIES CALLED 
I THINK THAT'S STILL VERY MUCH A FRINGE MOVEMENT STILL AND IT IS STILL COMPARATIVELY VERY VERY SMALL 
AND I THINK THE MAINSTREAM STILL FINDS A LOT OF THAT STUFF KIND OF 
BUT FRINGE MOVEMENTS HAVE A WAY OF BECOMING MASS 
MAY BE TO THE NINETIES WHAT WERE TO THE FIFTIES 
IT WAS THE WHO SET THE STAGE FOR THE HIPPIES 
SO THE MINORITY TODAY IS SIMILARLY SETTING THE STAGE FOR A VERY LARGE SOCIAL MOVEMENT IN THE LATER HALF OF THIS DECADE 
AT WIRED THEY ARE TRUE BELIEVERS AS WELL AS OF THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION 
I THINK WE'RE JUST AT THE CRESTING EDGE OF IT 
I THINK IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS WE'LL REALLY GOING TO BE SEEING RADICAL CHANGES 
IT MAY BE CHIC TO BE A GEEK NOW BUT IT COULD BE ESSENTIAL WHEN THE DUST SETTLES ON THIS REVOLUTION 
THE PROMISE OF A DIGITAL REVOLUTION IS A BETTER LIFE BY BEING PLUGGED INTO THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY OR AS THEY SAY AT WIRED THE 
UP NEXT YOU'LL MEET SOME ELECTRONIC ALTER EGOS WHICH CAN HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY ON THE
