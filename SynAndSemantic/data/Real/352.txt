WE BEGIN WITH RWANDA WHERE A STEADY STREAM OF ATROCITIES ON AN INCREDIBLE SCALE HAVE HAS PROMPTED THE UNITED NATIONS TO ACT 
THE STORY FROM C. N. N.'S RICHARD ROTH WHO JOINS US FROM THE U. N. RICHARD 
JEANNE FIVE WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRES AND ALL OF THE BRUTAL VIOLENCE IN RWANDA BROKE OUT THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL HAS TAKEN PERHAPS ITS FIRST CONSIDERABLE ACTION AFTER IT WITHDREW THOUSANDS OF PEACE KEEPERS WEEKS AGO 
EARLY THIS MORNING NEW YORK TIME THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL VOTED TO AUTHORIZE FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEACE KEEPERS TO GO INTO RWANDA 
BUT THERE IS A CATCH THEY WILL NOT BE LEAVING ANY TIME SOON 
INSTEAD IN A COMPROMISE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY OBSERVERS WILL ACT AS SCOUTS GO INTO RWANDA TO ASSESS THE SITUATION AND THE LEVEL OF NEED AND WHERE THE FORCES COULD BETTER BE DEPLOYED AND THEN REPORT BACK 
THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL WILL AWAIT A REPORT FROM THE SECRETARY GENERAL BEFORE IT AGREES TO DEPLOY ANY ADDITIONAL FORCES 
THERE ARE FORCES FROM A BATTALION WHO WILL GO BACK INTO KIGALI THE CAPITAL 
AND ALONG WITH THE OBSERVERS THAT WILL BE IT FROM THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL 
THERE WERE HARSH WORDS INSIDE THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER NATIONS 
THE U. S. WHICH PAYS ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL PEACE KEEPING DUES WANTED TO HAVE THIS MISSION BETTER DEFINED AS PART OF ITS NEW OVER ALL GLOBAL PEACE KEEPING POLICY 
OTHER NATIONS CITING THE LEVEL OF MASSACRES THERE WERE IN FAVOR OF GETTING A LARGE FORCE IN THERE NOW 
BUT AFTER THE COMPROMISE EARLY THIS MORNING THE COUNCIL VOTED FOR THE LANGUAGE TO AUTHORIZE FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEACE KEEPERS 
BUT THEY ARE NOT LEAVING IMMEDIATELY 
THOUGH HE VOTED FOR IT NEW ZEALAND'S AMBASSADOR SAID HE COULDN'T CONCEAL HIS DISPLEASURE WITH THIS RESOLUTION SAYING THE COUNCIL SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED ANY LONGER TO SEND IN A LARGER FORCE 
THE U. S. DISAGREED 
IN OUR VIEW THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE COUNCIL TO CONDITION ITS AGREEMENT BY A REQUIREMENT FOR FURTHER REPORTS AND FURTHER REVIEW 
IN THE NEXT REPORT OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL ON RWANDA I WOULD EXPECT THE FOLLOWING FACTORS TO BE CLOSELY EXAMINED 
A WELL DEFINED CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES CONSENT OF THE PARTIES PROGRESS TOWARDS A CEASE FIRE AND THE DURATION OF THE MANDATE 
NOW U. S. AMBASSADOR MADELEINE ALBRIGHT TODAY IN TESTIMONY ON CAPITOL HILL IN WASHINGTON WENT A STEP FURTHER SAYING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEER FOLLY TO SEND IN A LARGER FORCE NOW INTO RWANDA 
THIS IS THE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING FROM THE UNITED STATES HERE AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
OTHER NATIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST TO IT 
BECAUSE THE U. S. WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE GOING AND WANTS TO HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY ON ALL OF THESE MISSIONS 
THERE ARE NOW EIGHTEEN SUCH GLOBAL U. N. PEACE KEEPING MISSIONS MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS ARE OUT THERE 
RICHARD ROTH C. N. N. REPORTING LIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS 
THERE IS A REPORT OUT OF RWANDA OF AN ATROCITY THAT IS HORRIFYING EVEN BY THE STANDARDS OF A COUNTRY WHERE RANDOM KILLING HAS BECOME AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE 
AID WORKERS FROM KIGALI REPORT THAT TEN CHILDREN AND A U. N. EMPLOYEE WERE HACKED TO DEATH BY MEN WITH MACHETES 
NONE OF THE CHILDREN WAS MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS OLD 
AT THE SAME TIME U. N. OFFICIALS ARE RECEIVING REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT RWANDAN REBELS ARE INVOLVED IN ATROCITIES AGAINST CIVILIANS 
THE REBELS DENY THOSE ALLEGATIONS 
U. N. OFFICIALS SAY MORE PEACE KEEPING TROOPS COULD HELP PREVENT THE SLAUGHTER 
ONE U. N. RELIEF OFFICIAL TOLD C. N. N. HE BELIEVES PEACE KEEPERS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN RWANDA THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN OTHER HOT SPOTS 
NUMBER 
I THINK THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BOSNIAN SITUATION OR THE SITUATION 
WE EXPECT TO PUT INTO EFFECT AN OPERATION WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE WARRING FACTIONS AND A SMALL INTERVENTION FORCE WE HAVE THE POWER TO TAKE SELF DEFENSE AGAINST PRESENCE OF GROUPS WHO THREATEN PROTECTED SITES AND POPULATIONS AND ALSO U. N. PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS ALSO THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
WE WILL DO THIS WITH THE COOPERATION OF BOTH WARRING FACTIONS 
THESE HAVE CONVENTIONAL FORCES 
WE ARE NOT HERE TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM 
WE ARE HERE TO ASSIST IN RESTORING PEACE AND STABILITY 
SO THE U. N. WILL WORK WITH IT 
C. N. N.'S GARY HAS BEEN MONITORING THE SITUATION IN RWANDA FROM NEARBY REFUGEE CAMPS 
HE SAID ON THE PHONE EARLIER TODAY THAT U. N. PEACE KEEPERS FACE AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK IN STOPPING THE SLAUGHTER 
EVEN IF THE U. N. FORCE IS STRENGTHENED TO FIVE AND A HALF THOUSAND TROOPS IN WEEKS TO COME PATROLLING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND PROTECTING ALL CIVILIANS WOULD STILL BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
AID WORKERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY THE HARD LINE HUTUS IN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE CREATED A MONSTER BY INCITING GENOCIDE AMONG THE HUTUS AND THAT THE KILLING OF TUTSIS WILL STOP ONLY WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE TUTSIS LEFT TO KILL 
THE SITUATION FOR RWANDANS WHO HAVE ESCAPED THE KILLING IS GETTING MORE DESPERATE AS WELL
