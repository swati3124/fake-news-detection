FINALLY FROM US THIS EVENING A WOMAN WHO KNEW HOW TO SPEND HER MONEY 
WHEN RYAN DIED OVER THE WEEKEND SHE DIED A VERY RICH WOMAN 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAD WON THE LOTTERY 
MS. RYAN HAD SAID SHE DID NOT WANT THE TO CHANGE HER LIFE AND SHE CERTAINLY MADE SURE IT HELPED TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF OTHERS 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S MIKE VON FREMD 
WHEN RYAN FLEW TO TALLAHASSEE SIX YEARS AGO TO COLLECT HER PRIZE SHE ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD THAT SHE WAS ENJOYING THREE FIRSTS 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A PLANE BEFORE 
THIS IS MY FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE 
AND NUMBER THREE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER WON FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS 
SHE SPENT THE REST OF HER LIFE DOING TWO THINGS GIVING HER MONEY AWAY AND PROTECTING HER PRIVACY 
AT THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO THE REAL ESTATE AGENT HAD LIVED ALONE IN THIS TRAILER PARK 
AFTER SHE WON SHE MOVED TO A BETTER HOUSE WITH HER TWO CATS 
ONE OF THE FIRST CHARITIES TO BENEFIT FROM HER GOOD FORTUNE WAS THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA'S ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP TO FIND HOMES FOR STRAY CATS 
THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING 
SHE WAS DELUGED WITH REQUESTS FOR MONEY AND SHE HAD AN INTERESTING WAY OF SCREENING THEM 
I LEARNED LATER THAT SHE WAS WATCHING THE INTERVIEW AND LISTENING THROUGH A ONE WAY MIRROR 
AND WHEN SHE HAD REALIZED THAT THIS WAS A WORTHY PROJECT A WORTHY PROGRAM I BELIEVE IS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO COME OUT AND INTRODUCE HERSELF 
RYAN GAVE DON A VAN TO REPAIR HOMES FOR THE POOR 
SHE ALSO GAVE MONEY TO HELP CHILDREN IN NEED OF MEDICAL HELP THROUGH THE COMPASSION CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
RYAN NEVER WANTED ANY PUBLICITY FROM THE CHARITIES SHE HELPED 
SHE WAS AN INTENSELY PRIVATE PERSON 
SHE HAD NO CHILDREN SHE DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER SHE HAD EVER BEEN MARRIED 
ONE OF THE FEW INTERVIEWS SHE EVER GRANTED WAS TO STUDENTS FROM NEARBY HIGH SCHOOL WHERE SHE ESTABLISHED A SCHOLARSHIP 
ONE THING THAT ALWAYS AMAZED THE STUDENTS ABOUT RYAN WAS THE FACT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT WINNING THE MONEY TO HER WAS THE FACT THAT SHE COULD GIVE IT AWAY 
HER ESTATE WILL RECEIVE ANOTHER THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FLORIDA LOTTERY 
SHE LEFT BEHIND A CHARITABLE FOUNDATION TO SEE THAT IT GETS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
