TONIGHT ON NOVA THE DISCOVERY OF TOP SECRET NAZI FILES A PAINFUL CHAPTER IN HISTORY 
THEY SHOUT MEN AND WOMEN TO SEPARATE AND I'M TAKING FOR GRANTED THAT MY MAMA IS FOLLOWING 
FROM THAT DAY ON I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MOTHER ALIVE 
CHILLING NEW EVIDENCE REVEALS THE CAREFUL PLANNING BEHIND THE NAZI DEATH CAMPS 
IT SAYS VERY CLEARLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO KILL AND TO BURN SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THIS BUILDING 
NAZI DESIGNERS OF DEATH 
IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR LONG OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LEFT HUNGARY HEADING FOR AUSCHWITZ 
IN JUST THREE MONTHS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JEWS WERE TO DEATH AND PILED INTO THAT COULD BURN THREE THOUSAND BODIES A DAY 
THE INDUSTRIAL EXTERMINATION OF THE JEWS IN AUSCHWITZ BEGAN IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FORTY TWO WHEN FOUR HUGE WERE DESIGNED AND BUILT BY HITLER'S STORM TROOPERS THE S. S. 
AS GERMANY FACED DEFEAT THE NAZIS TRIED TO DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES BUT THE FILES OF THE ARCHITECTS OF AUSCHWITZ WERE OVERLOOKED 
ONLY NOW ARE THESE DOCUMENTS BEING ANALYZED REVEALING LONG HIDDEN SECRETS BEHIND THE PLANNING OF THE HOLOCAUST AND THE GUILT OF MEN WHO DESIGNED AND BUILT THE MACHINERY OF DEATH IN AUSCHWITZ 
THESE MEN BELONGED TO THE S. S. THE ARMED WING OF THE NAZI PARTY LED BY 
THE S. S. HAD ITS OWN CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT IN BERLIN HEADED BY FRITZ 
IN AUSCHWITZ A BRANCH OFFICE KNOWN AS THE OR NEW BUILDING OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER KARL AN ARCHITECT 
OTHER ARCHITECTS WALTER AND FRITZ ALSO SERVED THE THIRD REICH HERE 
FOR FOUR YEARS THIS OFFICE PRODUCED DRAWINGS AND DOCUMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF ALL NEW BUILDINGS IN AUSCHWITZ 
IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN SOME OF THESE PAPERS WERE USED AS EVIDENCE IN THE TRIAL OF THE COMMANDANT OF AUSCHWITZ AND OTHER WAR CRIMINALS 
THESE DOCUMENTS EVENTUALLY WERE HOUSED IN THE MUSEUM THAT WAS SET UP IN THE OLD CONCENTRATION CAMP BUILDINGS IN AUSCHWITZ 
THERE THEY REMAINED LARGELY IGNORED UNTIL A YOUNG PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE A DUTCH JEW ROBERT VAN DECIDED TO THEM TO COUNTER CLAIMS OF THOSE WHO DENY THAT THE HOLOCAUST EVER HAPPENED 
THE WORDS GAS CHAMBER NEVER APPEAR ON ANY PLANS BUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD INTERPRET THE BLUEPRINTS TO EXPOSE THE PRECISE MECHANICS OF THE HOLOCAUST 
THERE ARE SO CALLED HOLOCAUST WHO ON THE BASIS OF THE KIND OF OPAQUE NATURE OF THESE PLANS HAVE STARTED TO TO ARGUE THAT IN FACT THERE WERE NO KILLINGS OR THAT NO NO MASS MURDER OR GENOCIDE TOOK PLACE IN AUSCHWITZ 
AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO SOME VERY CAREFUL DETECTIVE WORK TO SEE THESE THINGS 
IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THE SOVIET ARMY LIBERATED AUSCHWITZ 
MEMBERS OF THE K. G. B. WHO ENTERED THE CAMP TOOK ALL THE DOCUMENTS THEY COULD FIND AND TRANSPORTED THEM TO A SECRET LIBRARY IN MOSCOW 
THERE SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE ACCESS TO THESE PAPERS HAS BEEN DENIED TO ANYONE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE GERALD FLEMING A PROFESSOR OF GERMAN LITERATURE AND AUTHOR OF A BOOK ON NAZI WAR CRIMES FOUND OUT ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE FILES IN THIS SPECIAL ARCHIVE 
THERE APPEARED THIS ARTICLE IN IZVESTIA SAYING THAT THEIR CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER HAD BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS SPECIAL TROPHIES ARCHIVE IT WAS CALLED THEN AND I SENT A TELEGRAM TO THE EDITOR OF IZVESTIA THANKING HIM FOR HAVING MADE THIS PUBLIC AND SAID I WILL FOLLOW IT UP. AND THEN AS I SAID TO MR. SHEVARDNADZE 
THIS RESEARCH IS VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS YOU KNOW ONE TELEGRAM AFTER ANOTHER UNTIL IN THE END YOU'VE GOT ALL IN PLACE 
AND I WENT OVER THERE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE I THINK IT WAS IN OCTOBER IT WAS ALREADY GETTING COLD AND I BEGAN WORKING ON THE CAPTURED AUSCHWITZ CENTRAL BUILDING ADMINISTRATION ARCHIVE WHICH THE GERMANS THANK GOD HAD FORGOTTEN TO DESTROY 
IN THESE SECRET FILES GERALD FLEMING SOUGHT EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND CONFESSIONS OF THOSE WHO HAD ENGINEERED THE HOLOCAUST 
THESE HE FOUND 
HE ALSO DISCOVERED A MASS OF LETTERS MINUTES AND OTHER PAPERWORK OF THE AUSCHWITZ ARCHITECTS 
THESE ARCHIVES CONTAINED AN IMPORTANT NEW SOURCE OF INFORMATION 
IT IS THE ABSOLUTE DUTY OF A VERY VERY SMALL NUMBER OF SCHOLARS YOU CAN COUNT THEM ON LESS THAN ONE HAND TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE MATERIAL THAT HAS UNTIL VERY VERY RECENTLY BEEN CLOSED AND IS NOW ACCESSIBLE TO A TINY NUMBER A BARE HANDFUL OF SCHOLARS BE WORKED THROUGH ANALYZED AND THAT IT SHOULD GO INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN 
TODAY THE ENTIRE MOSCOW ARCHIVE AS WELL AS THE PAPERS FROM THE AUSCHWITZ MUSEUM CAN BE FOUND HERE IN THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON 
ROBERT VAN CAN NOW WORK ON THE COMPLETE RECORD OF THE BUILDING OF THE AUSCHWITZ CONCENTRATION CAMP 
A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS HAVE SURFACED IN MOSCOW OF COURSE WHICH HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THEIR EXISTENCE BEFORE AND HAVE PROVIDED ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION OF AUSCHWITZ FROM A LABOR CAMP INTO AN EXTERMINATION CAMP IN EARLY NINETEEN FORTY TWO 
AUSCHWITZ BEGAN AS AN CAMP FOR POLISH PRISONERS WHEN HITLER INVADED POLAND IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND GERMANY 
THE NAZIS IMPOSED A REIGN OF TERROR ON THE POLISH POPULATION ROUNDING UP THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND JAILING THEM IN A PRISON CAMP THEY ESTABLISHED AT AUSCHWITZ 
LIFE HERE WAS VIOLENT AND AND THE PRISONERS WERE SUBJECT TO ARBITRARY PUNISHMENT AND EXECUTION 
IF ANYONE ESCAPED THE ROLL CALL WOULD TAKE FIVE SIX HOURS LONGER 
WHAT I LIVED THROUGH 
THE ROLL CALL WAS AN ENIGMA FOR EVERY PRISONER 
HE WOULD COME BACK BUT NEVER KNEW WHEN HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO AND WARM HIMSELF AND IT WAS MINUS TWENTY BELOW 
LONG BEFORE THE FINAL SOLUTION WAS IMPLEMENTED THE BRUTALITY OF THE S. S. IN AUSCHWITZ MEANT THAT THE DEATH TOLL WAS VERY HIGH AND MANY BODIES HAD TO BE DISPOSED OF 
ALREADY QUITE EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE THAT THEY THEY WANT TO BODIES QUICKLY WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION OF THE RELATIVES 
AN ENGINEERING COMPANY IN GERMANY AND SONS HAD SUPPLIED THE FOR SEVERAL OTHER PRISON CAMPS AND THE ENGINEERS FROM WOULD BECOME CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THE NEW BUILDING DEPARTMENT IN AUSCHWITZ 
THEY WERE BRAUN THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR KARL THE VENTILATION ENGINEER AND THE CHIEF DESIGNER KURT 
FOR THE S. S. WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM CIVILIAN INCINERATORS 
HIS DESIGN COMBINED TWO OVENS OR IN THE SAME INCINERATOR 
TWO BODIES COULD BE BURNED AT THE SAME TIME SAVING ON FUEL 
AFTER AND SONS HAD BUILD THE FIRST OVEN IN AUSCHWITZ CORRESPONDENCE NOW FOUND IN MOSCOW SHOWS THAT THE S. S. ASKED THEM TO BUILD A SECOND SET OF OVENS IN AUTUMN NINETEEN FORTY AND THEN A THIRD SET A YEAR LATER 
BY EARLY NINETEEN FORTY TWO THERE WERE THREE INCINERATORS HERE DOUBLE INCINERATORS 
WE HAVE HERE THE FIRST ONE WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FORTY THEN THERE IS HERE ONE WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FORTY AND TO THE BACK IS A THIRD OVEN WHICH ISN'T THERE ANYMORE WHICH WAS BUILT IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
THEY'RE CHEAP 
I MEAN YOU SEE THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE STRUCTURES 
IF WE WOULD GO TO A CIVILIAN INCINERATOR WE WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF APPROPRIATE DECORATION WHICH GIVES A CERTAIN DIGNITY TO THE PIECE AS A LAST PLACE WHERE A CORPSE IS TRANSFORMED INTO ASHES 
THE NEXT STAGE IN THE TRANSITION OF AUSCHWITZ FROM PRISON TO DEATH CAMP CAME IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
HEAD OF THE S. S. MADE HIS FIRST VISIT WITH A PLAN THAT WOULD RAPIDLY ENLARGE THE NUMBER OF INMATES 
IT HAS TO DO WITH A LARGE PROGRAM OF WHAT WE CALL TODAY ETHNIC CLEANSING IN WHICH THE POLISH POPULATION IN THIS AREA MOVED OUT IN A VERY BIG SCALE AND ETHNIC GERMANS FROM EASTERN POLAND ARE BROUGHT HERE TO THE AREA 
THIS BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ALL THE SETTLERS WHO MOVED IN THE AREA JUST SOUTH OF AUSCHWITZ AND PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST TELLING ILLUSTRATIONS IS THIS ONE WHERE WE SEE THE ETHNIC GERMANS MOVING FROM WHEREVER THEY HAD LIVED FOR CENTURIES TO A NEW AND BRIGHTER FUTURE IN THE AREA OF AUSCHWITZ 
THE AREA AROUND AUSCHWITZ HAD LARGE DEPOSITS OF COAL AND SUPPLIES OF WATER AND THE GIANT CHEMICAL COMPANY I. G. BECAME INTERESTED IN LOCATING A MASSIVE FACTORY THERE 
NOW SEES A FEW OPPORTUNITIES IN AUSCHWITZ WHICH DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE 
FIRST OF ALL HE SEES THAT HE CAN IN SOME WAY SUPPLY LABOR TO THE BUILDING UP OF THE PLANT AND AND GET MONEY FOR THAT GET AN INCOME FOR THAT 
NOW THAT'S WHY HE COMES IN MARCH NINETEEN FORTY ONE TO AUSCHWITZ VISITS THE AREA WITH EAGER OFFICIALS AND THEN DECIDES TO ESTABLISH IN BIRKENAU INITIALLY A CAMP FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS 
THE GERMAN INVASION OF RUSSIA WOULD PROVIDE PRISONERS OF WAR THE SLAVE LABOR TO BUILD THE I. G. FACTORY 
THE LOCATION FOR THE NEW CAMP TO HOUSE THESE PRISONERS WAS TO BE THREE KILOMETERS FROM AUSCHWITZ AT A SITE CALLED BIRKENAU NAMED AFTER THE BIRCH WOODS THAT FRINGED IT 
THE SLAVE LABOR CAMP FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS WAS LARGER THAN ANYTHING THE S. S. HAD ORGANIZED BEFORE 
THIS IS THE FIRST PLAN WHICH WAS CREATED BY A YOUNG ARCHITECT FRITZ WHO WAS WORKING ALREADY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR A YEAR IN THE S. S. 
AND HE DRAFTS HIS PLAN ON THE WHAT IS IT IT WAS THE FOURTEENTH OF OCTOBER ACTUALLY HAD ANOTHER ONE TOO AND A PLAN HERE AND ONE EVEN ONE WEEK EARLIER 
WE CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW THESE DESIGNS WEEK BY WEEK ALMOST AS THEY ARE CREATED AND AS THEY ARE CHANGED 
AND NOW SUDDENLY HE HAS TO DESIGN SOMETHING FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SO HE DOES THIS GREAT FIELD OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED METERS BY AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY METERS AND HE'S GOING TO PUT IN THIS LARGE FIELD A NUMBER OF BARRACKS ARRANGES BARRACKS IN WHAT HE THINKS IS A SENSIBLE WAY 
BUT THE ARCHITECT HAD TO MODIFY THE PLANS WHEN ORDERED A FURTHER ENLARGEMENT OF THE CAMP TO TAKE AN EXTRA TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS 
AND SO IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTION OF MARCH FIRST NINETEEN FORTY ONE SUDDENLY THEY DECIDE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF EACH 
AND SO HE CROSSES OUT THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY PUTS IN SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FOUR AND THAT'S THE NEW OFFICIAL CAPACITY OF THE CAMP SO NOW THE CAMP CAN HOLD ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INMATES INSTEAD OF A LITTLE UNDER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INMATES 
AND THIS IS WHAT SUCH A DRAWING TRANSLATES INTO 
THIS WAS DESIGNED TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AFTER AN INITIAL CALCULATION OF AROUND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AND THE CHANGE WAS MADE BY SIMPLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIVE ON A IN A BAY LIKE THIS ON A LIKE THAT FROM THREE PEOPLE TO FOUR PEOPLE 
AND I CALCULATED THIS ONCE 
THE SPACE OF THIS LITERALLY PEOPLE HAD FIFTY NINE CUBIC FEET PER PERSON INCLUSIVE THE CORRIDORS INCLUSIVE ALL THE OTHER SPACE WHICH IS MORE OR LESS THE SPACE OF A COFFIN 
NOT ONLY WERE THE BARRACKS HORRIBLY OVERCROWDED THEY CONTAINED NO SANITATION FACILITIES AT ALL 
THIS SECTION OF THE CAMP WAS SUPPOSED TO HOUSE TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THERE WERE TWO OF THESE BARRACKS WHERE IN EACH SITTING FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE COULD SIMULTANEOUSLY 
SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE IN FACT ONE FOR SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE 
NOW THIS IS ALREADY HORRIBLE AND YOU HAD TO DO IT ALL IN A HURRY TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES IN THE MORNING WAS ALL THE TIME ALLOWED FOR THIS 
THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO FLUSH THE SEWERS 
THE RUSSIAN PRISONERS DIED BY THE THOUSANDS OF DYSENTERY AND 
THE S. S. REALIZED THAT A CAMP OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS WOULD NEED TO DISPOSE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BODIES 
AS WE KNOW FROM A LETTER OF OF THE FOURTEENTH OF OCTOBER THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME DAY THAT THE SECOND PLAN WAS APPROVED THAT WOULD COME TO AUSCHWITZ IN ORDER TO DESIGN FOR THEM IN A KIND OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE CHIEF ARCHITECT A NEW FOR BIRKENAU 
CAME TO THE MEETING IN AUSCHWITZ WITH A BOLD CONCEPT 
FIVE SETS OF THREE OVEN INCINERATORS WERE TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN A ROW ALL LINKED TO ONE CHIMNEY AND HOUSED IN A GRAND NEW BUILDING 
AND WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS IS THE SIZE OF THIS 
FIFTEEN CORPSES CAN BE BURNED AT THE SAME TIME MAYBE EVEN MORE 
WHAT WE SEE HERE IS A MAIN ROOM IN WHICH WE SEE FIVE OVENS PERFECTLY LABELED ONE THROUGH FIVE EACH WITH THREE INCINERATORS AND HERE IN DETAIL WHICH IS QUITE INTERESTING THIS IS A DOOR OUTSIDE AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY STAIRS GOING INTO THAT BASEMENT AND A IT'S CALLED A SLIDE SO YOU CAN SORT OF BRING CORPSES IN AND THEY CAN YOU CAN SLIDE THEM DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARRY THEM 
THE CORPSE CHUTE OR WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE ACCESS TO TWO LARGE UNDERGROUND WITH VENTILATION SYSTEMS BUILT INTO THE WALLS 
THESE WERE KEY ELEMENTS IN THE FUTURE TRANSFORMATION OF THE INTO GAS CHAMBERS BUT ON THE PLANS AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THIS BUILDING IS FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN OF THE BODIES OF THE DEAD PRISONERS OF BIRKENAU 
THIS GRAND WAS AN EXPENSIVE PROJECT AND THE DID NOT WANT TO BUILD IT IN BIRKENAU IN WHAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE A TEMPORARY LABOR CAMP 
THEY PLANNED TO BUILD IT IN THE AUSCHWITZ PRISON 
IN OCTOBER NINETEEN FORTY ONE GOERING CLAIM ON RUSSIAN PRISONERS OF WAR AND HAD TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR THE SLAVE LABORERS THAT HE NEEDED FOR THE I. G. FACTORY 
JEWS WHO WERE BEING ROUNDED UP AND KILLED WERE THE ONLY AVAILABLE SOURCE 
DECISION TO USE THE JEWS AS SLAVE LABOR AT BIRKENAU WAS A FUNDAMENTAL BREAK WITH A POLICY THAT HAD STARTED WITH THE INVASION OF THE SOVIET UNION IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
FOLLOWING BEHIND THE GERMAN ARMY WERE THE OR SPECIAL GROUPS TEAMS OF S. S. MEN AND POLICE WHOSE JOB IT WAS TO ROUND UP THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND SLAUGHTER THEM IMMEDIATELY 
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES TO PLACES NEAR THEIR VILLAGES AND TOWNS AND SHOT 
IN CITIES WITH A LARGE JEWISH POPULATION THE KILLING WENT ON FOR DAYS 
THESE MASS SHOOTINGS WERE TOO PUBLIC AND TOO PSYCHOLOGICALLY STRESSFUL EVEN FOR THE S. S. AS THE SOVIET ARCHIVES REVEALED TO GERALD FLEMING 
HE INVESTIGATED THESE CRIMES AND INTERROGATIONS OF SOME OF THE NAZI OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE 
WE HAVE SPEAKING TO THE S. S. AND POLICE LEADER AGAIN AND HE SAYS THE SHOOTING OF ALL THESE PEOPLE HE WAS REFERRING TO THE SHOOTING OF OVER TWENTY THOUSAND JEWS IN THAT IS TO SAY OUTSIDE IN THE FOREST WHICH WAS WITNESSED BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND ALSO THERE WERE HOUSES NOT FAR AND PEOPLE STANDING THERE WITH BINOCULARS WATCHING THIS AS WAS SAID LATER ON BY WITNESSES SPEAKING TO WHEN HE CAME TO REPORT THEY'D ALL BEEN SHOT SAYS THAT THE SHOOTING I TRANSLATE THIS HERE THE SHOOTING IS A COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT OPERATION AND WE NEED THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO IT 
IN OTHER WORDS IT IS NOT NOT EVERYBODY IS NOT EVERYBODY IS VERY FOND OF DOING IT 
TO MAKE THE GENOCIDE MORE COVERT DEATH CAMPS WERE ESTABLISHED AT TREBLINKA AND USING CARBON MONOXIDE TO GAS PEOPLE TO DEATH 
BUT AT AUSCHWITZ SOME JEWS WOULD BE SELECTED TO WORK AS SLAVE LABORERS AND WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY 
THE MOSCOW ARCHIVES REVEAL THAT AROUND THIS TIME A DECISION WAS ALSO MADE TO BUILD THE LARGE IN BIRKENAU NOT AUSCHWITZ 
A PLAN DATED FIVE JANUARY NINETEEN FORTY TWO CLEARLY SHOWS THE LOCATION OF THE NEW BUILDING 
THEN THIS STARTS TO MOVE AROUND IT IS NOT A FINAL PLACE AND IT ENDS UP IN ANOTHER PLAN IN JUNE NINETEEN FORTY TWO IT SITS HERE RIGHT CLOSE TO THE RAILWAY LINE AT THE END OF THE RAILWAY LINE 
AND THEN WE HAVE A PLAN OF AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY TWO WHERE THERE ARE TWO SITTING RIGHT THERE 
WHY DID THE PLANS FOR THIS BUILDING CHANGE SO MUCH IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF NINETEEN FORTY TWO AND WHY WERE TWO BUILDINGS PLANNED NOT ONE 
THE ANSWER IS THAT AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU WAS NOW ASSUMING ITS FINAL FUNCTION AS A DEATH CAMP 
COMMANDANT HAD BEEN TOLD BY IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE THAT AUSCHWITZ WAS GOING TO BE A CENTER FOR KILLING THE JEWS AND THAT HE WANTED A METHOD THAT WAS MORE RELIABLE THAN CARBON MONOXIDE 
AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED USING A PESTICIDE CALLED B. 
ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF AND ALSO HIS MEMOIRS THE FIRST TRIAL TOOK PLACE IN THIS BUILDING IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHEN IT HAPPENED IN THAT FALL 
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT IT HAPPENED IN SEPTEMBER 
THESE CELLARS HERE WERE SMALL ROOMS AND THEY LENT THEMSELVES TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO EXPERIMENTAL ROOMS 
THE EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED ON SIX HUNDRED RUSSIAN PRISONERS AND THREE HUNDRED SICK INMATES WHO WERE LOCKED INTO THE CELLARS OF BLOCK ELEVEN 
THEN OF B. WERE THROWN INTO THE CELLS 
IT IS REPORTED THAT THE VICTIMS TOOK TWO DAYS TO DIE 
B. WAS SMALL PELLETS OF HYDROGEN CYANIDE AND WAS USED AS A PESTICIDE AND AGENT IN THE CAMP TO COMBAT 
WHEN THEY STARTED TO GAS IN THE CANS STARTED TO ARRIVE AND WE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A NAME 
I REMEMBER TO THIS DAY BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY WORKED IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUREAU AND THE FIRST PARCEL CAME OF THESE CANS AND THEN OUR S. S. MAN THE ONE WHO WAS IN THE OFFICE HANS STARK WELL HE SWORE AND SAID WHAT IS THIS BOX DOING STANDING IN THE CORRIDOR BECAUSE HIS TROUSERS WERE CAUGHT AS HE HAD THESE SO CALLED AND HE WAS AS ELEGANT AS GOERING THIS STARK 
THAT'S WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE 
AND THEN WE TOLD HIM IT WAS B. 
IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN FORTY TWO THE FIRST TRANSPORT OF JEWS WERE LOADED UP AND SET OFF FOR AUSCHWITZ 
BY THEN THE MORGUE OF THE FIRST IN AUSCHWITZ HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A GAS CHAMBER 
THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS SPACE AND YOU HAVE TO FILL THE SPACE REALLY WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE THE AGENT THAT KILLED THEM B. WAS A GAS WHICH ONLY EVAPORATES AT TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
SO YOU BRING IN ALL THE PEOPLE THEIR BODY HEAT STARTS TO HEAT THE ROOM AND THEN THE GAS CRYSTALS WERE THROWN IN THROWN LIKE THESE WHICH WE SEE IN THE CEILING 
THE GAS CRYSTALS CAME IN AND STARTED TO DISSOLVE IN THE HEAT AND PEOPLE DIED 
THE S. S. WANTED THE KILLINGS TO BE KEPT SECRET 
USING THE AT AUSCHWITZ CAUSED PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE COULD NOT EASILY BE CONCEALED FROM OTHER INMATES AND VISITORS 
SO THE KILLING OPERATIONS WERE MOVED TO BIRKENAU 
TWO IN THE BIRCH WOODS WERE CONVERTED TO GAS CHAMBERS BY SEALING THE WINDOWS AND DOORS 
LITTLE REMAINS OF THEM EXCEPT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THIS THE SECOND ONE TO BE CONVERTED 
AT THIS POINT THE BODIES HAD TO BE DISPOSED OF BY BURYING 
THEY WOULD TAKE OUT THE BODIES AND THEY WOULD BURY THE BODIES AT THE SITE WHICH WE SEE OVER HERE WITH ALL THESE STARS OF DAVID AND CROSSES 
AND THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN FORTY TWO THE GERMANS CREATED MASS GRAVES HERE IN WHICH BODIES WERE STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND THEN THEY CLOSED THE GRAVES AND THEY HOPED THAT THAT WAS THE END OF THEIR PROBLEM OF CORPSE DISPOSAL 
BUT THE DECOMPOSING CORPSES RAPIDLY POLLUTED THE WATER TABLE AND WHEN THE WINTER MELTED THE EARTH OF BIRKENAU BROUGHT THE CORPSES BACK TO THE SURFACE 
IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO AGAIN VISITED BIRKENAU TO INSPECT THE PROGRESS AT I. G. AND OBSERVE PLANS FOR KILLING THE JEWS 
HE INSPECTED A SELECTION AND OBSERVED THE IN ONE OF THE 
HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF THE DISPOSAL OF THE CORPSES AND ORDERED THAT THE BODIES OF OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VICTIMS WERE TO BE DUG UP AND BURNED 
THE SLOVAK HIS NAME WAS SAID COME WITH ME 
THERE WERE FOUR OF US 
HE THEN WENT TO ONE OF THE BARRACKS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN BARRACKS OPENED THE GATE AND THERE WE SAW STRANGE PEOPLE SITTING THERE SUCH AS I HAD NEVER SEEN HAIRY DIRTY WITH DREADFUL SMELL 
THEY WERE THE ONES DOING THE DREADFUL JOB OF DIGGING OUT THE CORPSES AND BURNING THEM POURING SOMETHING OVER THEM PETROL OR WHAT 
THE BODIES THE WHOLE MASS HAS TO DISAPPEAR 
WHEN THEIR JOB WAS OVER AT THE END OF NOVEMBER OR WAS IT EARLY DECEMBER THE MEN WERE TAKEN AWAY 
HOWEVER REALIZED THAT THIS COULD NOT BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION 
IT WAS A TOO VISIBLE WAY TO DISPOSE OF THE BODIES 
THE ENGINEER WAS SUMMONED TO A MEETING IN THE 
DOCUMENTS SUGGEST THAT ONE MONTH AFTER VISIT A DECISION WAS MADE THAT WOULD MASSIVELY INCREASE THE ABILITY TO BOTH KILL PEOPLE AND EFFICIENTLY DISPOSE OF THEIR BODIES IN BIRKENAU 
AGAIN THE PLANS FOR THE WOULD BE REVISED WITH THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER TWO BUILDINGS CALLED THE FOURTH AND V. COMBINING GAS CHAMBERS AND INCINERATORS ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW THE GAS CHAMBERS WERE NEVER LABELED AS SUCH ON THE PLANS 
NOW I HAVE HERE A REPORT OF A MEETING CHAIRED BY ON THE NINETEENTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY TWO 
IT MENTIONS THAT PROPOSES TWO TRIPLE OVENS FOR THE FUR WHICH MEANS FOR THE FACILITIES FOR SPECIAL ACTIONS 
THIS IS THE JARGON FOR KILLING 
SO HE WANTS TO BUILD TWO INCINERATORS RIGHT NEXT TO BUNKERS ONE AND TWO 
COMES OUT OF THIS MEETING WITH AN ORDER FOR A SECOND BIG WITH FIFTY PLUS TWO OTHER EACH WITH EIGHT 
THE PROJECTS DISCUSSED IN THIS MEETING ARE NOW WHAT LIES IN RUINS IN BIRKENAU 
BY THE END OF AUGUST WHEN HAVE HIS COMMISSIONS TELL COMPLETED THE MASTER PLAN OF THE CAMP WHICH WAS NOW TO ACCOMMODATE MASS MURDER 
AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAMP WAS REALLY VERY SIMPLE AS IT APPEARS IN THESE FINAL MASTER PLANS 
BASICALLY WE HAVE THE FIELDS HERE WITH THE BARRACKS WHICH FOLLOWS VERY MUCH DESIGN OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE IT HAS EXPANDED AND THEN TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE CAMP AWAY FROM THE MAIN LINE OF TRAFFIC THE RAILROAD BETWEEN BETWEEN CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND WE HAVE THE FOUR THE SECOND THE THIRD AND BOTH SIDES OF THE RAILWAY LINE SPUR INTO THE CAMP WHICH WILL BE COMPLETED IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AND THEN IN THE FOREST THE FOURTH AND V. REALLY BACK UP INSTALLATIONS 
SO THE TRAINS WOULD COME FROM THE MAIN RAILWAY LINE ON THIS SPUR AND THEN THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE GATE AND ARRIVE IN THE STATION OF AUSCHWITZ 
THERE A SELECTION WOULD TAKE PLACE RIGHT AT THIS POINT WHERE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CHOICES 
PEOPLE COULD BE SENT EITHER TOWARDS THE SECOND AND THE THIRD HERE AT THE END WEST END SIDE OF THE STATION OR THEY COULD BE SENT THROUGH THIS ROAD TOWARDS THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CAMP TOWARDS THE FOURTH AND V. 
THE REPORT OF THE AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY TWO MEETING MAKES CLEAR THAT WAS AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN BIRKENAU 
IT IS ALSO APPARENT THAT THE ARCHITECTS UNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF THE NEW BUILDINGS AS WELL 
THE SECOND WAS ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THE BLUEPRINTS REVEALED THE CHANGES THEY MADE TO THE BUILDINGS TO TRANSFORM THE UNDERGROUND INTO GAS CHAMBERS 
NOW WE HAVE THE NEXT PLAN 
THIS IS DATED ON THE NINETEENTH OF DECEMBER NINETEEN FORTY TWO AND HERE WE FIND A VERY REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT 
IT'S DRAWN BY WALTER HIMSELF 
HE'S AN ARCHITECT HE'S NOT ONE OF THE INMATES 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A KIND OF SECRETIVE PLOT 
WE SEE NOW THAT THE SLIDE HAS DISAPPEARED 
NOW WHY IS THERE A NEW WHICH IS ON THE SIDE OF THE RAILWAY TRACKS 
THE REASON IS VERY CLEAR THAT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE A DESIGN WHICH INDICATES THAT THOSE WHO WILL IN SOME WAY OCCUPY THE ARE ALIVE WHEN THEY COME IN 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE INTO A GAS CHAMBER WAS MADE EASIER BY AN ORIGINAL FEATURE OF THEIR DESIGN SEEN HERE IN THIS CROSS SECTION DRAWING A VENTILATION SYSTEM THAT WAS TO BE BUILT INTO THE WALLS 
WE ARE SITTING HERE ON THE FLOOR OF WHAT REMAINS OF THE FLOOR OF THE GAS CHAMBER OF NUMBER THE THIRD AND IT'S QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT WE SEE THE REMAINS OF THE VENTILATION SYSTEM WHICH HAD BEEN DESIGNED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING FOR THIS MORGUE AND IT WAS THIS VENTILATION SYSTEM WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT THE GAS VERY VERY QUICKLY 
OTHER MODIFICATIONS INCLUDED GAS TIGHT DOORS WITH AND SUPPLIED THE GAS DETECTORS 
AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY TWO WORK STARTED ON THE THREE NEW IN BIRKENAU AND THE PRISONERS WERE ORGANIZED INTO MASSIVE WORK GROUPS 
WELL THE DIFFERENCE WAS ENORMOUS COMPARED WITH ALL THE OTHER CAMPS 
ON MY SECOND DAY THERE I SAW PRISONERS CALLED TO WORK WHEN THE PRISONERS WERE GROUPING INTO FOUR GROUPS 
EACH GROUP HAD TWO PEOPLE HOLDING A LARGE BANNER WITH WRITTEN SIGNS I THE SECOND THE THIRD THE FOURTH 
I KEPT STARING AT IT AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT 
THEN A SLOVAK PRISONER CAME WHO HAD BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME AND EXPLAINED TO ME THAT FOUR WERE BEING BUILT ALL AT THE SAME TIME 
I ASKED HIM WHY FOUR WELL EVEN FOR THE TWO OF US HE SAID 
THAT MADE ME REALIZE I HAD COME TO A PLACE WHERE I WAS GOING TO HAVE MY OWN FUNERAL 
CONSTRUCTION TOOK PLACE DAY AND NIGHT NONSTOP 
BUT SOMETIMES THERE WERE STOPPAGES WHERE MATERIALS WERE NOT DELIVERED DUE TO LACK OF WAGONS OR THE SEVERE WINTER 
NOT ONE OF THE WAS FINISHED ON TIME 
THE DELAYS CREATED CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY IN BERLIN BECAUSE THE LIQUIDATION OF THE GHETTOS WAS PROCEEDING APACE 
THE TRANSPORTS WERE BEING LOADED AND THE MOMENTUM OF THE FINAL SOLUTION COULD NOT BE STOPPED 
THE HEAD OF THE BUILDING ADMINISTRATION IN BERLIN FRITZ WRITES URGENTLY TO AUSCHWITZ 
HE SAYS IN HIS LETTER OF THE ELEVENTH OF JANUARY I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEMS BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING TO GET STUFF FINISHED AND BE PLEASE KEEP ME DAY BY THE WEEK BY WEEK OF WHAT IS HAPPENING 
AND SO WE HAVE A FIRST REPORT ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JANUARY NINETEEN FORTY THREE IN WHICH GIVES TO A REPORT 
ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JANUARY A WEEK LATER WE HAVE ANOTHER REPORT THIS ONE WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE ELECTRICITY SIGNED BY A MEMBER OF A. E. G. THE MAJOR GERMAN ELECTRICITY COMPANY WHICH IS GOING TO CREATE THE INSTALLATION 
IT SAYS VERY CLEARLY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KILL AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BURN SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THIS SO WE WE LOOK AT THIS AND WE SEE IT'S NOT ONLY IT'S NOT ONLY THE BUILDERS WHICH ARE INVOLVED BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MAJOR GERMAN ELECTRICITY COMPANIES A. E. G. WHICH STILL TODAY HAS A VERY PROSPEROUS EXISTENCE IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC 
FINALLY THE WERE FINISHED AND HANDED OVER TO THE S. S. 
FIRST THE SECOND WAS COMPLETED AND SIX HUNDRED JEWS ON MARCH THIRTEENTH 
THEN THE FOURTH AND V. WERE COMPLETED AND FINALLY THE THIRD 
A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE SECOND IT WAS HANDED OVER IN JUNE NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
BIRKENAU WAS FULLY OPERATIONAL 
POISON GAS AND TECHNOLOGY HAD BEEN DELIBERATELY COMBINED TO CREATE A MECHANISM OF MASS MURDER 
FINALLY HERE ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT SAYS THAT IN I THAT THREE HUNDRED FORTY PEOPLE CAN BE INCINERATED EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
THEN IN NUMBER THE SECOND AND THE THIRD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY PEOPLE EACH AND THEN THE FOURTH AND V. SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
SO THERE IS A DAILY INCINERATION CAPACITY IN AUSCHWITZ AT THAT MOMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX PERSONS 
JEWS IN THE GHETTOS THROUGHOUT EUROPE WOULD BE ROUNDED UP AND LOADED WITH A HANDFUL OF THEIR BELONGINGS ONTO TRANSPORT TRAINS 
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WOULD BE SLOWLY CARRIED WITHOUT FOOD WATER OR SANITATION TOWARDS AUSCHWITZ 
THESE TRANSPORTS WOULD ARRIVE ON A DAILY BASIS ON THE RAILWAY LINES AT BIRKENAU 
HERE THOSE LEFT ALIVE WOULD BE UNLOADED 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS 
IT WAS LIGHT 
THE TRAIN STOPS 
YOU HEAR RUNNING IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE S. S. THE GESTAPO AND THEY TOLD US ARE OPENING UP AND THEY SHOUT TO US OUT OUT 
QUICK QUICK QUICK 
I SAW A GROUP OF S. S. MEN STANDING HERE OR WALKING ABOUT 
THE RAILWAY TRUCKS WERE THERE TOO 
AND IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THE TRUCKS 
AND THEN PEOPLE WERE GROUPED INTO TWO LINES 
ONE WAS FOR MEN THE OTHER WAS FOR WOMEN WITH CHILDREN 
THEY SHOUT MEN AND WOMEN TO SEPARATE MEN ONE COLUMN WOMEN ON THE OTHER COLUMN AND WE FORMED LIKE A FIVE ROW 
SO MY SISTER AND I AND MY THREE FRIENDS WE STOOD LIKE IN 
FIRST THE MEN MOVED ON SLOWLY BEFORE THE S. S. MAN WHO STOOD ABOUT HERE SOMEWHERE 
THEY CAME BEFORE HIM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND HE WAVED HIS GLOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
THOSE ON THAT SIDE WENT TO THAT AND THE OTHERS STOOD WAITING HAVE BEEN DETAILED FOR WORK 
THOSE WERE MAINLY YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND WE'RE ALL WALKING AND I'M TAKING FOR GRANTED THAT MY MAMA IS FOLLOWING WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER 
AND AS WE APPROACHED IN FRONT TO THIS S. S. AND GESTAPO AND HE STAND LIKE THIS WITH HIS FINGER LIKE YOU THIS WAY 
I'M HERE LIKE TOWARD LIKE I'M TOWARDS YOU AND HE'S STANDING THERE AND HE'S GOING LIKE THIS 
AND US FIVE GIRLS JUST TO THIS GATE AND OTHER PEOPLE GOING TO THROUGH THIS GATE 
AND FOR A SLIGHT SECOND I DIDN'T TURN AROUND 
I'M TAKING FOR GRANTED MY MAMA IS FOLLOWING ME 
BUT AS I TURN AROUND TO SEE WHETHER SHE'S COMING SHE'S ALREADY GONE 
SO FROM THAT DAY ON THAT WAS NINETEEN FORTY FOUR VERY EARLY SEPTEMBER OR SO I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MOTHER ALIVE AND MY LITTLE BROTHER 
THAT TOOK AT LEAST AN HOUR THE WHOLE PROCEDURE 
IT WAS PERFECTLY WELL ORGANIZED 
THE MAIN AUSCHWITZ CAMP PROBABLY HAD RECEIVED A TELEGRAM OR SOME OTHER MESSAGE THAT A TRANSPORT WAS COMING AT SUCH AND SUCH A TIME AND THEY HAD BY THEN GIVEN THE ORDER TO START THE FIRE IN THE OVENS 
THE LUGGAGE WHICH THEY WERE HELPED WITH STAYED HERE PILED UP AND THEY WENT ON WITHOUT IT 
THEY WERE PROMISED THEY WOULD GET IT ALL BACK AND OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T NEED ANYTHING ANY LONGER 
I HAD TO GET USED TO IT SLOWLY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO 
EVERYONE GOT USED TO IT 
AND THE WORST WAS WHEN THEY CARRIED WOMEN ON AN OPEN TRUCK IN SHIRTS 
THEY WERE TAKING THEM TO THE AND WE SAW IT ALL YOU KNOW 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT WORK THE OLD THE YOUNG AND THOSE WITH CHILDREN WERE MARCHED TO ONE OF THE FOUR GAS CHAMBERS IN BIRKENAU AND TO DEATH 
ALL THAT REMAINS NOW OF THIS MASS SLAUGHTER ARE BLUEPRINTS AND THE TWISTED WRECKAGE OF THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES 
THIS IS THE RUIN OF THE SECOND OF WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THE DESIGNS IN THE ARCHIVE 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CONDEMNED TO DIE HERE WOULD IMMEDIATELY FILE INTO THE WHICH IS BEHIND HERE COME OUT OF THAT DOOR THERE AT THE LEVEL FILE THROUGH A DOWN HERE INTO THE GAS CHAMBER 
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE CORPSES WERE MOVED AND THEN TO THE SIDE HERE WE SEE THREE TIMES FIVE TIMES THREE TRACKS FOR THE WHICH ALLOWED THE TO BRING IN THE CORPSES INSIDE THE OVENS 
AND WE CAN CHECK AGAIN THE EVIDENCE AS WE FIND IT ON THE SITE WITH THE BLUEPRINTS AND WE SEE HERE THE LITTLE RAILWAY TRACK PLUS THE RAILWAY TRACKS INTO THE OVENS AGAIN ALL THIS IS LABELED AND SO ON 
IF WE NOW MOVE TO THE FOURTH AND V. WE COME IN A KIND OF DIFFERENT UNIVERSE 
THE SECOND AND THE THIRD WERE BUILDINGS WHICH WERE ADAPTED INTO KILLING INSTALLATIONS AND THERE WERE ALL THESE AWKWARD ELEMENTS IN THEM FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE KILLING TOOK PLACE UNDERGROUND AND THAT BURNING TOOK PLACE ABOVE GROUND 
HERE WE HAVE A COMPLETELY RATIONAL DESIGN WHICH ACCOMMODATES KILLING AND BURNING IN A LOGICAL WAY 
THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF HAVING ABOVE GROUND GAS CHAMBERS WAS THAT IT ACTUALLY ALLOWED FOR NATURAL VENTILATION 
IN THE KILLING PROCESS OF COURSE THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS HOW QUICKLY AFTER YOU'VE KILLED THE VICTIMS CAN YOU THE GAS CHAMBER IN ORDER TO CLEAN THE GAS CHAMBERS OUT AND BURN THE CORPSES 
AND THAT IS THE REASON THERE ARE ACTUALLY LARGE DOORS IN EACH OF THESE GAS CHAMBERS AT THE OUTSIDE 
AS THE FINAL SOLUTION OF THE JEWISH PROBLEM IS PER DEFINITION A PROJECT OF LIMITED DURATION THE GERMANS ONLY WANT TO SPEND THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF MONEY ON IT 
ALL THE BITS AND PIECES WHICH IN SOME WAY HAD FACILITATED THE WORKING OF THE INCINERATORS IN THE SECOND AND THE THIRD WERE ABANDONED 
ONE OF THE MOST TELLING BITS IS THIS ROLLER 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS VERY SOPHISTICATED KIND OF TO MOVE THINGS IN 
IT WAS THAT YOU JUST MOVED THE CORPSE OVER THIS ROLLER INTO THE INCINERATION 
THIS IS A REAL KILLING MACHINE 
IT HAS NO OFFICIAL LINK ANYMORE TO THE OFFICIAL USE OF THE CAMP AS A PRISONER OF WAR CAMP 
BY EXAMINING THE CAMP RECORDS AND MORE IMPORTANT THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE TRANSPORT SUPPLIED BY THE GERMAN RAILWAYS IT IS POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MURDERED IN AUSCHWITZ 
IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME TO THE CAMP ESPECIALLY JEWS FROM VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHO WERE THEN LED DIRECTLY FROM THE UNLOADING RAMP TO THE GAS CHAMBERS AND KILLED 
SUMMING UP ALL THE DATA FROM INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TRANSPORT BY TRANSPORT I CAME TO THE NUMBER OF ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEPORTED TO THIS CAMP 
FOLLOWING THAT ADDING ON THE DATA CONCERNING TO OTHER CAMPS ESCAPES VERY FEW ESCAPES AND VERY FEW RELEASES SIMILARLY WE GET A NUMBER OF ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND KILLED IN AUSCHWITZ 
IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THE PRISONERS WERE EVACUATED TO OTHER CAMPS 
THE SOVIET ARMY FOUGHT THEIR WAY INTO IT IN JANUARY NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
THE FIGHTING WENT ON THREE DAYS THREE DAYS 
THERE WERE TRENCHES AT THE APPROACHES TO THE CAMP THE FIRST TWO KILOMETERS AWAY WITH SHELLS AND TANKS DUG IN 
AND THIS HAD TO BE KNOCKED OUT AND THIS WASN'T ONLY RIGHT BY THE CAMP BUT TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT 
AND I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THINGS WHICH REALLY SHOCKED ME 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE SUCH ATROCITIES I SAW THERE WITH MY OWN EYES 
I SAW CHILDREN'S SHOES ON BIG RACKS LITTLE BOOTS ARRANGED VERY NEATLY THAT BIG FOR BABIES OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR TWO YEARS THEN SOME A BIT BIGGER ALL OF THEM NUMBERED AND NEATLY ARRANGED 
APPARENTLY THEY WERE PREPARED FOR TRANSPORTATION TO GERMANY 
I SAW BOXES OF SPECTACLE FRAMES SPECTACLES 
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORE THEM HAD BEEN TURNED INTO ASHES 
AT FIRST I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS WOMEN'S HAIR A FEW TONS 
AT THAT MOMENT I REALLY SUFFERED AND I SWORE THAT UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR I'D KILL GERMANS 
WHEN AUSCHWITZ WAS LIBERATED AS SOON AS THE ENEMY WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM THE TOWN OUR POLITICAL COMMANDER CAME THERE 
THEY EVEN CAME FROM THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AND THE FROM AND GRABBED THE DOCUMENTS 
WHEN THE SOVIET ARMY OCCUPIED EAST GERMANY THE K. G. B. WENT IN SEARCH OF THOSE WHO HAD LEFT THEIR TRADEMARK IN THE CAMP AND ARRIVED IN WHERE THE MAKERS OF THE OVENS AND SONS WERE BASED 
A RUSSIAN G. R. U. KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF TECHNICAL DIRECTOR BRAUN KURT THE CHIEF ENGINEER KARL THE EXPERT IN THE DESIGN OF VENTILATION AND AIR EXTRACTION SYSTEMS 
THEY WERE TAKEN TO JAIL IN AND WHILE THEY WERE IN BY THE WAY THEIR WIVES RECEIVED FULL PAY FROM THE FIRM 
SENIOR ENGINEER KURT WAS INTERROGATED IN 
WHICH TECHNICAL INSTALLATIONS FOR THE GAS CHAMBERS WERE CONSTRUCTED AND INSTALLED BY ANSWER AT FIRST THE GAS CHAMBERS WERE CALLED GERMAN WAS 
IN THE MORGUE A VENTILATION SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED AND SUBSEQUENTLY IT BECAME CLEAR TO US THAT THIS GAS CHAMBER WAS USED FOR THE KILLING OF HUMAN BEINGS 
THERE WERE OTHER INTERROGATIONS OF COURSE AND IT WAS KARL WHO WAS INTERROGATED ONE DAY PRIOR TO 
QUESTION WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO OBSERVE WHEN YOU WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A AND IN THE GAS CHAMBER ANSWER WHEN I WAS IN AUSCHWITZ I COULD SEE AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY HOW S. S. MEN WERE DRIVING A GROUP OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT OF THEM 
I HAD OBSERVED ALL THIS AT ABOUT FOUR P. M. 
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS IN THE AT TEN A. M. AND THERE I SAW SIXTY CORPSES MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT AGES 
THEY WERE LYING ON THE GROUND AND JUDGING BY THEIR EXTERNAL APPEARANCE THEY HAD BEEN IN THE GAS CHAMBERS 
WAS SENTENCED TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND DIED IN PRISON 
THE VENTILATION ENGINEER AND BRAUN THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR WERE JAILED FOR FOURTEEN YEARS IN MOSCOW 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE THEY WERE RELEASED BY THE RUSSIANS AS PART OF A GENERAL AMNESTY FOR GERMAN PRISONERS 
THEY RETURNED TO THEN DISAPPEARED 
THE COMPANY OF AND SONS HAD MADE SEVERAL MILLION REICH MARKS IN THE YEARS THAT THEY HAD WORKED FOR THE S. S. 
IT SURVIVED IN MAKING BREWING EQUIPMENT AND IS NOW MANAGED BY THE SON OF BRAUN 
HE REFUSED TO BE FILMED BUT DID ALLOW US TO RECORD THIS STATEMENT 
WE TOOK OVER THE COMPLETE BUILDINGS FROM OUR FATHERS YOU MIGHT SAY 
HISTORIANS MUST LOOK INTO THE PAST TO GO FORWARD BUT I DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE LEISURE 
THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION I HAVE TO CONCERN MYSELF WITH TURNOVER AND THE PROFIT COLUMN IN BETWEEN 
IF I TOOK SO MUCH TIME TO LOOK INTO THE DAMAGE DONE BY THIS FIRM THEN THE BANK WOULD SAY GO HOME THAT'S IT THIS IS QUITE TRIVIAL ' 
THE ARCHITECTS WHO HAD WORKED SO DILIGENTLY TO DESIGN THE FOUR AND THEIR GAS CHAMBERS AND WHOSE SIGNATURES WERE ON THE DRAWINGS WERE NEVER ROUNDED UP 
THE CHIEF ARCHITECT DIED IN GERMANY IN NINETEEN FIFTY 
AND WENT TO AUSTRIA AND BECAME SUCCESSFUL ARCHITECTS UNTIL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THEY WERE FINALLY BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND CHARGED WITH BEING WAR CRIMINALS 
IN VIENNA IN THE COUNTY COURT A TRIAL STARTS OF THE ARCHITECTS 
NOW YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT DURING THIS TRIAL THE DOCUMENTS THE ACTUAL BLUEPRINTS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CENTER OF ATTENTION 
THE REMARKABLE THING IS THAT EVEN IN THE TRIAL OF THE ARCHITECTS THE DOCUMENTS WERE THERE BUT IN FACT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET THEM 
AND WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY 
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THE VERDICT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY DIFFERENT TODAY BUT THE RESEARCH THAT ROBERT VAN GERALD FLEMING AND OTHERS ARE DOING IN THE LONG IGNORED FILES OF AUSCHWITZ SHOWS THAT THERE WERE MANY MORE PEOPLE WHO WERE PREPARED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE GENOCIDAL PLANS OF THE NAZIS AND THAT THEY WERE PRECISELY AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS 
WHAT THIS NEW RESEARCH MAKES VERY CLEAR IS THAT THE HOLOCAUST WAS NOT JUST THE FRINGE PHENOMENON THAT INVOLVED AN ISOLATED FEW BUT IT WAS A WHOLESALE LARGE SCALE OPERATION THAT INVOLVED WHO HAD MEASURES OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT WERE DIVERSE SOME OF WHOM KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND SOME OF WHOM COULD HAVE KNOWN AND WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF THEY DID NOT ENGAGE IN THE SUPPRESSION THE INNER SUPPRESSION OF OF OF DIFFICULT INFORMATION AS ONE OF THE WAYS OF EASING THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE 
THERE IS THE BEAST IN MAN AND THESE THINGS COULD CONCEIVABLY HAPPEN AGAIN AT ANY TIME ANYWHERE
