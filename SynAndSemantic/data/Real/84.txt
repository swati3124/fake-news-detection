THE QUESTION NOW IS WHY 
WHY DID DEATH RAIN FROM THE SKY OVER A DEADLY POPULATED AREA SOUTHEAST OF DOWNTOWN AMSTERDAM 
WHY DID THIS ISRAELI CARGO JET AN EL AL BOEING SEVEN FORTY SEVEN TWO HUNDRED LOSE TWO OF IT'S ENGINES AND CRASH INTO A HIGH RISE APARTMENT COMPLEX 
AFTER TO THE RUNWAY AT AIRPORT SUNDAY THE PILOT TOOK OFF 
FIVE MINUTES LATER HE REPORTED ENGINE NUMBER THREE ON THE RIGHT WING IN FLAMES 
HE REQUESTED PERMISSION TO RETURN TO THE AIRPORT 
MINUTES LATER ENGINE FOUR WAS ALSO ABLAZE THE JET WENT DOWN 
YELLOW FIRE A BIG FIRE AND THE SAME TIME WE ARRIVED THE FIRST FIREMAN ARRIVED AND HE COULD NOT EVEN TOUCH THE FLAMES 
WHAT I SEE WAS A EVERYWHERE FIRE 
EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WE LIVE NEAR HERE 
WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND SAW THE PLANE FLYING VERY VERY LOW OVER THE HOUSES 
MY HUSBAND SAW IT TOO 
I SAID IT'S GOING DOWN AND I LOOKED AND BOOM 
EVERYWHERE FIRE EVERYWHERE FIRE 
IT STRUCK WITH LITTLE WARNING TO THOSE ON THE GROUND 
THE GRIM SEARCH FOR VICTIMS ENDED THURSDAY FOUR DAYS AFTER THE CRASH 
EMERGENCY CREWS PULLED MORE THAN FIFTY BODIES FROM THE RUBBLE BUT OFFICIALS STRESS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REMAIN MISSING AND MAY NEVER BE FOUND 
SEARCHERS FOUND ONE OF THE CRUCIAL BLACK BOXES ON WEDNESDAY THE BADLY DAMAGED FLIGHT DATA RECORDER FOR THE PLANE 
INVESTIGATORS HOPE IT HOLDS CLUES TO WHAT CAUSED TWO OF THE GIANT ENGINES TO COME OFF 
I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS IN THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DEVICE FOR ASSISTING US IN OUR INVESTIGATION 
EMERGENCY CREWS FOUND THE TWO ENGINES ONE WAS RECOVERED FROM UNDERWATER IN A NEARBY LAKE PARTS OF THE OTHER ENGINE WERE FOUND ON LAND 
INVESTIGATORS SAID THE ENGINE PULLED FROM THE LAKE SHED LITTLE LIGHT ON WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE CRASH 
WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY PARTICULAR CLUES THERE WAS NO FIRE OR NO TRACES OF FIRE ON THAT ENGINE 
SO FAR WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY INDICATIONS OF IMPACT 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO LINK THIS ACCIDENT WITH ANY OTHER BUT SIMILARITIES DO EXIST BETWEEN THIS CRASH AND ONE LAST DECEMBER WHEN TWO ENGINES FELL OFF FROM THE SAME SIDE OF A CHINA AIR BOEING SEVEN FORTY SEVEN 
AS A PRECAUTION THE MAKER OF THE JUMBO JET BOEING WARNED ALL OPERATORS OF SIMILAR SEVEN FORTY SEVEN'S TO INSPECT THEIR AIRCRAFT 
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK INTO THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO INCIDENTS 
THE LATEST INSPECTIONS CENTER ON STEEL PINS KNOWN AS FUSE PINS 
EACH PIN IS TWO AND A QUARTER INCHES IN DIAMETER AND FOUR INCHES LONG 
FOUR PINS SECURE EACH ENGINE TO THE WING OF A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN 
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BREAK AWAY ALLOWING A DAMAGED ENGINE TO FALL OFF RATHER THAN DAMAGE THE WING 
THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION SAYS AND METAL CRACKS HAVE PLAGUED THE PINS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE 
THE F. A. A. HAS ISSUED THREE DIRECTIVES TO SEVEN FORTY SEVEN OPERATORS REQUIRING INSPECTION AND REPLACEMENT OF THE PINS 
THE MOST RECENT ORDER CAME JUST LAST YEAR 
NEITHER BOEING NOR THE F. A. A. HAS LINKED THIS CRASH OF THE EL AL JET TO A PROBLEM WITH FUSE PINS 
BOEING CALLED SEVEN FORTY SEVEN OPERATORS TO ITS HEADQUARTERS IN SEATTLE THREE WEEKS AGO TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS WITH FUSE PINS AND ADVISED THEM TO CARRY OUT INSPECTIONS 
BUT BOEING WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER EL AL REPRESENTATIVE ATTENDED THAT MEETING AND WHETHER THE PLANE THAT CRASHED HAD BEEN INSPECTED 
THERE WAS TRAGEDY IN WEST VIRGINIA THIS WEEK AS WELL 
A WEST VIRGINIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CARGO PLANE CRASHED INTO A HOME NEAR BERKELEY SPRINGS 
ALL SIX CREW MEMBERS ON BOARD WERE KILLED 
THE PLANE WAS ON A ROUTINE TRAINING MISSION WEDNESDAY WHEN IT PLUNGED FROM THE SKY IN FLAMES 
IT'S SMASHED INTO THE HOME OF SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD RETIRED RAILROAD WORKER MILTON 
I WAS JUST SITTING AT THE TABLE GETTING READY TO COME OUTSIDE 
I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHING HOUSE SHOOK WHEN AND BOOM IT WAS IN FLAMES 
WHERE WERE YOU IN THE HOUSE WHEN IT HAPPENED 
RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE KITCHEN 
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE THAT WENT UP IN FLAMES HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT 
PRETTY DESPERATE 
I HAD STUFF IN THERE THAT I'D HATE TO GIVE UP 
THERE HAVE BEEN THREE OTHER CRASHES OF C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CARGO PLANES THIS YEAR 
LAST MONTH A NIGERIAN C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CRASHED INTO A SWAMP SHORTLY AFTER TAKE OFF FROM LAGOS 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED INCLUDING ARMY OFFICERS THEIR RELATIVES AND A CREW 
IN APRIL A C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ON A MILITARY TRAINING MISSION PLUNGED INTO A LAKE IN COUNTY NORTH CAROLINA 
ALL NINE CREW MEMBERS DIED AND IN FEBRUARY A KENTUCKY NATIONAL GUARD C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CRASHED WHILE PRACTICING TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS 
THE PLANE STRUCK A RESTAURANT AND MOTEL IN INDIANA KILLING SIXTEEN PEOPLE 
THE WEST VIRGINIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD HAS TEMPORARILY GROUNDED ALL OF ITS C. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY'S WHILE INVESTIGATORS DETERMINE WHY THE PLANE CRASHED 
FOR WEEK IN REVIEW I'M CHUCK ROBERTS 
AUTHORITIES STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED AN EXPLOSION THURSDAY AT A OIL IN LOS ANGELES SIXTEEN WORKERS WERE HURT BY THE BLAST 
IT COULD BE FELT FIFTEEN MILES AWAY 
THE IS EXPECTED TO BE CLOSED INDEFINITELY AND 'TIL THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE IS KNOWN
