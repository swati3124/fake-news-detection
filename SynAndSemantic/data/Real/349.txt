NEWSROOM IS SETTING ITS SIGHTS ON JULY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE AS WE PREPARE TO BOARD A TIME MACHINE TO GETTYSBURG SPECIFICALLY THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG A PIVOTAL EVENT IN AMERICA'S CIVIL WAR 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK I WILL BE IN GETTYSBURG PENNSYLVANIA BRINGING YOU REPORTS FROM TURNER ADVENTURE INTERACTIVE EVENT 
WE KICK THINGS OFF THOUGH TODAY WITH A LOOK AT THE EPIC FILM THAT BRINGS GETTYSBURG BACK TO LIFE 
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR WAS NORTH AMERICA'S BLOODIEST CONFLICT 
ITS MOST CRITICAL BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN THE SMALL PENNSYLVANIA TOWN OF GETTYSBURG IN JULY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE 
IN THREE DAYS MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND MEN FELL EITHER KILLED OR WOUNDED 
ON A BLAZING HOT AFTERNOON IN JULY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE FIFTEEN THOUSAND CONFEDERATE TROOPS STEPPED OUT OF THESE WOODS 
THEY WERE ABOUT TO LAUNCH A SOME WOULD SAY INSANE ATTACK ACROSS A MILE OF OPEN GROUND 
HISTORY WOULD CALL IT CHARGE 
NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO THAT SCENE CAME BACK TO LIFE 
IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE TURNER PICTURES BEGAN FILMING A FOUR HOUR EPIC CALLED GETTYSBURG ON THE VERY GROUND ON WHICH THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT 
FOR DIRECTOR RON MAXWELL IT WAS THE REALIZATION OF A FIFTEEN YEAR DREAM 
AND FOR THE THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED RE IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME 
IT'S LIKE MECCA OR JERUSALEM FOR US 
YOU KNOW JUST THIS IS THE CENTER OF CIVIL WAR RE 
THEY CAMPED AT THE SITE WITH ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THESE PEOPLE LIVING AND BREATHING THE CIVIL WAR 
SO WHEN WE HAD A SCENE FOR INSTANCE WITH MARTIN SHEEN PLAYING LEE HE RODE OUT 
THESE TROOPS WENT AROUND HIM AND THEY WERE CRYING OUT LEE AND VIRGINIA AND THEY WERE REACHING OUT TO TOUCH HIM 
AND IT BOUNCED OFF HIM AND IT BOUNCED BACK TO THEM AND THERE WAS THIS ENERGY 
IT WAS MYSTICAL 
WELL I ARRIVED OVER THERE ON THE SPOT WHERE THE ACTUAL CHARGE TOOK PLACE 
AS YOU KNOW WE WERE ALLOWED TO FILM THERE BY THE PARK SERVICE 
AND SEEING THESE THOUSANDS OF MEN COME ACROSS THE FIELD WITH THE DRUMS AND THEY'RE YELLING THAT REBEL YELL AND THE CANNONS TRYING TO PREVENT THEIR ADVANCE 
I TELL YOU I GOT A CHILL AND JUST TEARS ROSE IN MY EYES 
THOSE INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE RELIVED EVERY MOMENT OF THE BATTLE 
AND WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE MOVIE WAS DONE BUT THEY WERE LEFT WITH A DEEPER APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG 
I THINK THAT IT WILL BE A HEALING EXPERIENCE TO SEE THIS FILM 
IT SHOULD BE 
I THINK THAT THROUGH ALL THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION AND MURDER AND MAYHEM AND THE TRAGEDY OF IT ALL THERE WILL BE A CATHARSIS
