ONE PLACE TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE NOT PLAYING IT SAFE IS ON THE ICY GREAT LAKES 
ICE RELATED DEATHS ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH AND AS MARY REPORTS A WARMING TREND COULD LEAVE SOME SPORTS ENTHUSIASTS ON VERY THIN ICE 
STANLEY FOSTER AND HIS BUDDIES AREN'T FISHING TODAY 
THEY KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY'D BE TREADING ON THIN ICE 
GUYS HE DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU 
THE MICHIGAN MARINE SALVAGE THEY'RE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW PULLING THIS GUY'S R. V. OUT 
HE WENT THROUGH LAST NIGHT 
OTHERS IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION MISSED OR IGNORED WARNING SIGNS GIVING COAST GUARD CREWS CONSTANT WORK 
LAST MONTH IN MICHIGAN TWO MEN DROWNED WHEN THEIR BROKE THROUGH ICE AND JUST TWO WEEKS AGO IN TOLEDO OHIO ELEVEN FISHERMEN FOUND THEMSELVES STRANDED ON AN ICE DRIFT 
IN TOTAL TEN PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN GREAT LAKES WATERS THIS WINTER 
FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT SO THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUT THERE ALL WINTER AND THEY DON'T REALLY STOP AND THINK ABOUT THE WEATHER THAT WE'VE HAD 
IT'S RAINED IT'S BEEN WARM SO THERE COULD BE SOME ROTTEN SPOTS 
THE ICE IS DETERIORATING 
THE PROBLEM ICE FROM BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM BREAK ALWAYS CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING 
IF WE GET A STRONG WIND FROM THE WEST IT'LL BREAK OFF RIGHT AT THESE CRACKS RIGHT HERE AND SEND WHOLE SHEETS OF ICE OUT INTO THE LAKE 
AT NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUR THESE RESCUES ARE COSTING THE COAST GUARD PLENTY 
HEADING FROM RESCUE TO RESCUE IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WHILE THEY CAN REGULATE SAFE BOATING DURING SUMMER MONTHS THERE'S NO JURISDICTION TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE ICE REGARDLESS OF THE DANGER 
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO 
IF THEY THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR LIVES INTO THEIR OWN HANDS THAT'S THEIR DECISION 
THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHICH ADMINISTERS FISHING LICENSES SAYS FISHERMEN ARE NOT TO BLAME 
THEY'RE TACKLING ANOTHER PROBLEM 
THE MAJORITY OF ALL THE FATALITIES ARE ALCOHOL RELATED 
NOT THAT IT'S A COMPLETELY ALCOHOL FACTOR BUT IT IS A FACTOR AND WE ARE DOING MORE PATROLS TARGETING THAT TYPE OF AN OPERATION 
DURING TRAINING MISSIONS COAST GUARD OFFICIALS STRESS THAT NO ICE IS SAFE ICE 
IF YOU HEAD OUT ANYWAY TAKE ALONG SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 
IF HE'S READY HIS CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IS PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BETTER BECAUSE IF YOU'RE UNPREPARED AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH 
WITH THIS WINTER'S DEATH TOLL AT AN ALL TIME HIGH A NUMBER OF GREAT LAKES AGENCIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO SPREAD THE SAFETY MESSAGE 
SO FAR THE WARNINGS DON'T SEEM TO BE STRONG ENOUGH BECAUSE EVEN THOSE WITH NEAR MISSES STILL HEAD BACK OUT 
OH THEY LIKE THEIR 
I'D PROBABLY DO THE SAME THING
