MANY VICTIMS OF HURRICANE ANDREW ARE SPENDING THIS LABOR DAY WEEKEND AT WORK REBUILDING WHAT WAS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY THE STORM 
ANDREW LEFT FLORIDA WITH AN ESTIMATED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOUISIANA 
FIFTY ONE PEOPLE ARE DEAD A QUARTER OF A MILLION HOMELESS 
HURRICANE ANDREW'S WINDS MAY BE GONE BUT THE DISASTER IS FAR FROM OVER 
IT WAS VERY STRESSFUL IN THE BEGINNING BUT IT'S EXTREMELY STRESSFUL NOW 
I THINK REALITY HAS HIT 
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING 
THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL SAYS MORE PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE STORM'S AFTERMATH THAN IN THE STORM ITSELF AS STRESS AND STORM RELATED ACCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL 
FOR THOUSANDS GETTING FOOD AND ESPECIALLY SHELTER WERE STILL ALL CONSUMING TASKS MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER THE STORM 
RESIDENTS VOLUNTEERS AND SOLDIERS BEGAN THE MONUMENTAL JOB OF CLEANING UP AFTER TOTAL CHAOS 
BUT OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE DANGEROUS DEBRIS 
HOUSING INSPECTORS HAVE BEEN BRIGHT LABELS ON RUINED HOMES AND ASKING RESIDENTS TO LEAVE 
YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO GO TO TEMP CITY 
WE'RE CONDEMNING THESE BUILDINGS 
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THEM TODAY 
THEY SAYING THEY'RE CONDEMNING THE BUILDINGS 
WHAT ABOUT OUR FURNITURE AND THE LITTLE STUFF THAT WE STILL HAVE LEFT 
PLEASE I'M PLEADING WITH YOU PLEASE GO OVER TO TEMP CITY 
I'M NOT GOING TO NO TENTS BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST BOARD ME UP IN MY HOUSE 
I'M NOT STAYING IN NO TENT 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL NOT EVICT PEOPLE BUT THEY SAY THEY WON'T CONNECT ELECTRICITY UNTIL HOUSES ARE REPAIRED 
ELECTRICITY IS WORKING AT FIVE TENT CITIES BUILT THIS WEEK BY SOLDIERS TO HOUSE THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE 
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE TENTS THAT HAVE GONE UP OVER THE NIGHT EQUIPPED WITH COTS FOURTEEN PER 
BY THE END OF THE DAY THIS SITE WILL BE CAPABLE OF HOUSING ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
THE CITIES ARE PROVIDING FOOD AND HOT SHOWERS BUT LITTLE ELSE 
BY WEEK'S END THE TENTS REMAINED LARGELY EMPTY AS PEOPLE STUCK TO THEIR BATTERED HOMES 
WHAT LITTLE STUFF THEY'VE GOT HERE THEY'RE AFRAID SOMEBODY'S GOING TO LOOT IT SO I THINK THEY'LL STAY 
MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF THE TENT CITIES AND OTHER RELIEF EFFORTS SO THE ARMY IS PASSING OUT RADIOS AND HAS SET UP A RADIO STATION DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO RECOVERY NEWS 
SOME PEOPLE DID WELCOME THE CHANCE TO STOP CAMPING AMID THE RUINS 
THE SMELL IS TOO BAD AND THE BUILDING IS IN A VERY BAD CONDITION 
AND WHEN THEY OFFERED US TO STAY HERE WE SAID YES BECAUSE THIS IS BETTER THAN NOTHING 
IT'S MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WHERE WE WERE STAYING NOW 
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD SOLUTION FOR NOW 
BUT CRITICISM OF LAST WEEK'S SLOW FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER CONTINUED 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF F. E. M. A. AND SAID THE GOVERNMENT MUST LOOK ANEW AT ITS DISASTER RESPONSE 
THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY HAS MOST OF ITS RESOURCES IN BEING READY FOR CIVIL DEFENSE AND NUCLEAR WAR 
OVER SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ITS STAFF CAPACITY GOES INTO A NINETEEN FIFTIES FRAMEWORK KATHY SO THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA HAVE SHELTERS FOR NUCLEAR WAR BUT WE DON'T HAVE SHELTERS FOR THE PEOPLE OF HURRICANE ANDREW OR WHAT WE DID FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE 
THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY WAS READY FOR A NORMAL HURRICANE 
THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CRISIS HERE IN FLORIDA IS JUST BEYOND ANYONE'S EXPECTATION AND IT'S A MASSIVE EFFORT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF EFFORT AND WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WHOLE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED 
THE RELIEF EFFORT DID GROW DRAMATICALLY THIS WEEK 
NAVY SHIPS ARRIVED CARRYING SUPPLIES AS WELL AS CARPENTERS AND AND ARMY TROOPS BEGAN ARRIVING IN LARGE NUMBERS 
WE'RE NEED TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP OUT OUR PEOPLE AT HOME 
WE GO OVER THERE AND WE DEFEND EVERYBODY ELSE AND I FEEL IT'S NICE THAT WE STARTED DOING SOMETHING RIGHT HERE AT HOME 
INSURANCE AGENTS ARE USING SPRAY PAINTED PLEAS TO HELP FIND THEIR CLIENTS AND ARE BEGINNING TO ISSUE CHECKS 
PRIVATE DONORS PACKED SUPPLIES AND A TRAIN FROM NORTH CAROLINA BROUGHT HEAVY EQUIPMENT 
A FRONT END DUMP TRUCKS VANS TO GET OPERATORS TO THE EQUIPMENT EVEN A PORTABLE OFFICE 
THEY TRIED TO THINK OF EVERYTHING AND I THINK THEY DID 
PRESIDENT BUSH AGAIN FLEW TO FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA TO INSPECT ANDREW'S DAMAGE AND RELIEF EFFORTS 
HE ANNOUNCED THAT RUINED HOMESTEAD AIR FORCE BASE WOULD BE REBUILT AND HE SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE CLEAN UP COSTS INSTEAD OF SPLITTING THE BILL WITH THE STATE 
AND WHEN HE RETURNED HE MADE A RARE TELEVISED PLEA FROM THE OVAL OFFICE 
AND SO TONIGHT I MAKE A SPECIAL APPEAL TO THE GENEROUS SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
PEOPLE IN FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA WANT TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES 
THEY'RE IN DESPERATE NEED OF ROLLS OF PLASTIC TO COVER OPEN ROOFS LUMBER TO BOARD UP WALLS AND COTS TO SLEEP ON 
THEY ALSO NEED DIAPERS AND BABY FORMULA AND OTHER INFANT SUPPLIES AND FRESH VOLUNTEERS ARE NEEDED TO STAFF MEDICAL FACILITIES OR HELP WITH THE CLEANUP 
THE PRESIDENT GAVE A TOLL FREE NUMBER FOR THE AMERICAN RED CROSS AND CHARITY OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE SWAMPED WITH CALLERS WHO PLEDGED MORE THAN FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS 
AND RED CROSS WORKERS SAID THEY ARE SETTLING IN AFTER DAYS OF CHAOS 
AND WE'RE GETTING TO WHAT WE NORMALLY DO AND THE WAY WE NORMALLY DO IT 
THIS HAS JUST BEEN AN OVERWHELMING EVENT AND IT'S TAKEN US A WHILE TO GET TO THIS STATE 
WELL ONLY NINE DAYS LATER BUT WHEN YOU'RE HURTING YOU KNOW NINE DAYS SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY TO THE VICTIMS 
THE COMBINATION OF LIVING THROUGH TERROR AND THEN TRYING TO COPE WITH A WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN IS CAUSING PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS 
THEY'RE AFRAID TO COME OUT OF THEIR HOUSES 
THE ONLY THING THAT'S LEFT FOR THEM IS THE TENSIONS TO BUILD UP SO IN FACT WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME INCIDENCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
THE RED CROSS IS PROVIDING SOME COUNSELING 
AT LEAST ONE SURVIVOR SAYS THE SOUND OF THE WIND NOW MAKES HIM UNEASY AND THIS WEEK FORCED RESIDENTS TO DEAL WITH MORE WEATHER OFTEN WITHOUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS
