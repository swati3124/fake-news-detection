GOOD MORNING 
IT HAD ALL THE DRAMA THAT THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE DID NOT 
THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR VICE PRESIDENT IT OUT ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT WHILE THE INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE WATCHED THE BRAWL AND COMMENTED ON IT 
C. N. N.'S MARK LEFF HAS A REPORT ON THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 
WITH ONLY ONE COLLECTIVE SHOT AT A NATIONAL AUDIENCE AND WITH A MUCH MORE INTERACTIVE FORMAT THAN THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES' ENCOUNTER THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE MEN WHO WANT TO REPLACE HIM STARTED BY TALKING ABOUT THEIR BOSSES AND QUICKLY MOVED TO TALKING AT EACH OTHER 
YOU HAVE NOT TOLD US WHY BILL CLINTON IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
I POINTED OUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE PERSIAN GULF WAR 
BUT LET ME REPEAT IT FOR YOU 
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID SENATOR 
YOU KNOW FULL WELL WHAT 
DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION 
I'M MAKING A STATEMENT THEN YOU CAN ANSWER IT 
CAN WE GIVE ADMIRAL STOCKDALE A CHANCE TO COME INTO THIS DEBATE 
AND AGAIN AUDIENCE 
I LET ME BUT HE SAID PAL HERE'S WHAT HE SAID 
IF THE VOTE I MEAN THIS IS THE PERSIAN GULF WAR THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT IN HIS POLITICAL LIFETIME AND HERE'S WHAT BILL CLINTON SAID 
ALL RIGHT WE'VE 
IF IT'S A CLOSE VOTE I'D VOTE WITH THE MAJORITY 
RIGHT 
LET'S GIVE ADMIRAL STOCKDALE A CHANCE TO COME IN 
BUT IF BUT I AGREED WITH THE MINORITY 
THAT QUALIFIES YOU FOR BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
I HOPE AMERICA IS LISTENING VERY CLOSELY TO THIS DEBATE TONIGHT 
AND I THINK AMERICA IS SEEING RIGHT NOW THE REASON THIS NATION IS IN GRIDLOCK 
STOCKDALE THE LEAST KNOWN OF THE RUNNING MATES TALKED AS MUCH ABOUT HIS OWN LEADERSHIP QUALITIES AS THE SENIOR MAN IN A VIETNAMESE PRISONER OF WAR CAMP AS ABOUT THE MAN WHO HEADS HIS TICKET 
IN ONE OF THE FEW NON DOMESTIC DISCUSSIONS GORE CHALLENGED QUAYLE TO BACK UP A STATEMENT THE PRESIDENT HAD MADE IN SUNDAY'S DEBATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD ELIMINATED RUSSIAN INTERCONTINENTAL MISSILES AND THE FEAR OF NUCLEAR WAR THROUGH NEGOTIATION 
ISN'T IT A FACT DAN THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE S. S. IS STILL THERE IN THE SILOS 
AND UNDER THE START I TREATY ONLY HALF OF THE SILOS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DISMANTLED AND THERE IS NO DEAL TO GET RID OF THE OTHER HALF 
DIDN'T THE PRESIDENT MAKE A MISTAKE THERE 
VICE PRESIDENTIAL QUAYLE PLEASE 
THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM BORIS YELTSIN TO ELIMINATE THE S. S. 
THAT IS A COMMITMENT TO 
IS IT AN AGREEMENT 
IT IS A COMMITMENT AND WE 
OH 
SO 
WELL LET'S LET'S TALK LET'S TALK LET'S TALK ABOUT LET'S TALK ABOUT 
WELL HE SAID HIS TIME 
WELL LET HIM TALK SENATOR 
LIGHTEN UP HERE AL 
QUAYLE WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE WHEN THE TALK TURNED TO THE MAJOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HEALTH CARE REFORM AND LETTING PEOPLE TAKE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS 
PASS OUR PASS OUR FAMILY LEAVE ACT AND BECAUSE IT GOES TO SMALL BUSINESSES WHERE THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS 
YOUR PROPOSAL EXCLUDED SMALL BUSINESS 
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
NOW LET ME TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND I'M GLAD 
DID YOU REQUIRE IT 
I 
DID YOU REQUIRE IT 
MY TURN MY TURN 
IT'S MY 
DID YOU REQUIRE 
LIGHTEN UP AL MY TURN 
IT'S A FREE DISCUSSION 
TAKE A BREATH AL INHALE 
OVERALL THE DEBATE MIRRORED THEMES OF THE CAMPAIGN THE ARKANSAS GOVERNOR'S CREDIBILITY THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRACK RECORD AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GRIDLOCK 
THE UNITED STATES IS IN DEEP TROUBLE 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT CAN GET UP THERE AND BRING OUT THE FIRE HOSES AND GET IT STOPPED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT IN THE PEROT CAMPAIGN 
WE ARE BIGGER THAN GEORGE BUSH HAS TOLD US WE ARE AS A NATION AND WE HAVE A MUCH BRIGHTER FUTURE 
GIVE US A CHANCE 
WITH YOUR HELP WE'LL CHANGE THIS COUNTRY AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD DEMAND THAT THEIR PRESIDENT TELL THE TRUTH 
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE BILL CLINTON WILL TELL THE TRUTH 
AND DO YOU DO YOU TRUST BILL CLINTON TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT 
THE RUNNING MATES NOW RETURN TO THEIR OTHER DUTIES 
THE PRINCIPALS PICK UP THE ARGUMENT AGAIN ON THURSDAY
