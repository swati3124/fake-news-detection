IT SEEMS EVERY CHRISTMAS SEASON WE HEAR AT LEAST ONE TRAGIC STORY A FAULTY WIRING IN CHRISTMAS LIGHTS CAUSING TRAGIC RESULTS 
C. N. N.'S ED GARSTEN REPORTS ON ONE'S FAMILY'S LOSS AS WELL AS THE LOSS IN REPUTATION OF A NAME SOME PEOPLE TRUST 
THREE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS NINETEEN NINETY THE HOME IN CANTON MICHIGAN ERUPTED IN FLAMES 
MARTIN AND SIX OF HIS NINE CHILDREN DIED IN THE FIRE A FIRE CAUSED BY FAULTY LIGHTS IGNITING THE FAMILY CHRISTMAS TREE 
FOUR YEARS LATER DEBORAH RECALLS HOW CAREFUL SHE TRIED TO BE 
I LOOKED FOR THE LABEL WHEN I PURCHASED CHRISTMAS LIGHTS BECAUSE TO ME THAT WAS LIKE A GOOD HOUSEKEEPING SEAL 
IT MEAN THAT THAT PRODUCT HAD BEEN TESTED AND THAT IT WAS A SAFE PRODUCT 
BUT IT WASN'T 
SHE SUCCESSFULLY SUED UNDERWRITERS LABORATORY THE MANUFACTURER OF THE LIGHTS AND THE CALIFORNIA COMPANY THE COMPANY WHOSE NAME IS ON THE BOX BUT MERELY PACKS THE BULBS AND WIRES AND THEM 
FIRST OF ALL WE SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF THE LIGHT BULBS HAD A WIRE THAT WAS STICKING OUT 
YOU COMBINE THIS WITH A PROBLEM WITH THE WIRING WHICH WE DISCOVERED IT'S CALLED REVERSE POLARITY WHAT YOU HAVE IS A LIKELIHOOD OF SPARKING OR WHICH IS BASICALLY AKIN TO A TOASTER IN A CHRISTMAS TREE 
UNDERWRITERS LABORATORY WOULD NOT COMMENT ON CAMERA ABOUT THE SUIT ISSUING THIS STATEMENT THAT THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT CONSTRUE LIABILITY 
BUT THE INDEPENDENT TESTING COMPANY DID SAY IT HAS RIGOROUS STANDARDS FOR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS 
WE LOOK AT TWENTY INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTION FEATURES EVEN BEFORE WE START TESTING 
IF ALL THOSE CONSTRUCTION FEATURES MEET THE REQUIREMENT THEN WE HAVE A WHOLE BATTERY OF TESTS THAT WE RUN THROUGH 
BUT THESE COPIES OF INSPECTION FORMS SHOW THAT WHEN FIELD AUDITORS AS THEY'RE CALLED PAID VISITS TO TAIWAN SUPPLIERS THERE WERE NO LIGHTS AVAILABLE TO INSPECT 
EACH VISIT LASTED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES 
WHAT BASICALLY DID WAS ALLOW EVERYONE ELSE TO FALL ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH BECAUSE IF WASN'T VIGOROUSLY ENFORCING THE STANDARD THEN YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THE MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR WEREN'T ALL THAT CONCERNED ABOUT IT 
REFUSED TO COMMENT 
THERE ARE A FEW PRECAUTIONS YOU COULD TAKE BEFORE YOU BUY 
ONE IS SIMPLY TO DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE BULBS 
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO BARE WIRES COMING OUT OF THE SOCKET 
ANOTHER GOOD IDEA IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HANG THE LIGHTS INSIDE IS TO HAVE A SMOKE DETECTOR IN THE SAME ROOM 
AND THEN THERE'S THIS PRODUCT THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS IT'S A CHRISTMAS ORNAMENT YOU CAN HANG ON YOUR TREE THAT'S ALSO A SMOKE DETECTOR 
THE NAME THOUGH IS STILL ONE LABEL MANY CONSUMERS INSIST ON 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS BUT IF IT'S ON THE PACKAGE I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SAFE 
I LIKE TO SEE IT ON EVERYTHING I BUY 
BUT FOR DEBORAH WHO DEPENDED ON IT FOUR YEARS AGO 
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME NOW
