WELCOME 
HI CHARLIE 
THANK YOU FOR COMING 
I MEAN THIS IS MUCH AWAITED BY ME INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE OF A LOVE OF THE GAME AND BECAUSE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO INTERVIEW SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THIS SERIES WHETHER IT WAS BOB COSTAS OR TED WILLIAMS AND MANY MANY OTHERS 
SO I I WELCOME YOU FOR A CONVERSATION 
WHEN DID YOUR AFFAIR WITH BASEBALL BEGIN 
IT BEGAN IN NEWARK DELAWARE WHEN I PLAYED THE PONY LEAGUE AT AGE SIX AND SEVEN 
I WAS MY STRIKE ZONE WAS NOT THAT MUCH LARGER THAN EDDIE 
YEAH 
I WOULD WALK ON THE FIRST FOUR PITCHES STEAL SECOND ON THE FIFTH AND BE AT THIRD ON THE SIXTH 
I WAS THE LEAD OFF BATTER IN OUR GAMES 
WE HAD A MAN IN OR SHALL I SAY A BOY IN SCORING POSITION 
YEAH 
I LOVED IT 
I PLAYED IT 
IT WAS A REFUGE FROM THE TRAGEDY THAT WAS MY FAMILY 
MY MOTHER WAS VERY SICK THROUGH MOST OF MY EARLY CHILDHOOD AND I I DON'T HAVE THE MEMORIES THAT OTHERS HAVE ABOUT HAVING OF GOING TO THE GAME WITH THE FATHER OR THE MOTHER 
I WENT TO THE GAME MORE OR LESS ALONE 
YEAH 
AS A WAY TO ESCAPE THAT 
SOMEWHERE AROUND VIETNAM I FELL OUT OF BASEBALL AND CAME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN CARLTON FISK STARTED WAVING THAT BALL FAIR IN THE SIXTH GAME OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WORLD SERIES AND I 
YOU'RE A RED SOX FAN 
I AM 
YOU HAVE TO ADD THE WORD LONG SUFFERING BEFORE THE RED SOX FAN 
YES 
THAT TIME 
INTERESTING IN THIS FILM THERE IS A PIECE THAT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT FROM BOB COSTAS 
SO MANY PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN ASK ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUNG MEN AND OLDER MEN AND BASEBALL 
IN YOUR FILM IN A DRAMATIC AND CARING WAY BOB COSTAS DEFINES WHAT IT MEANT TO HIM AND HIS FATHER 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT 
HERE IT IS 
BOB COSTAS TALKING IN BASEBALL 
MY FATHER AND I HAD NOTHING IN COMMON 
SAD TO SAY 
NOTHING EXCEPT BASEBALL 
MY FATHER TOOK ME TO YANKEE STADIUM IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE 
I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD 
THE YANKEES LOST TO THE ORIOLES SEVEN TO TWO 
MANTLE DIDN'T PLAY HE WAS HURT 
AND AT THAT TIME AFTER THE GAME WAS OVER YOU COULD LEAVE BY WAY OF THE FIELD 
THEY WOULD OPEN UP THE BULLPEN GATES AND YOU COULD WALK AROUND THE WARNING TRACK TAKE IN THE ENTIRE MAJESTIC ENORMOUS BALLPARK AND THEN WALK OUT THE BACK OF THE INTO THE STREET 
THE GAME WAS OVER AND MY FATHER TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND WALKED ME PAST THE 
LOOKED INTO THOSE AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF AT AGE SEVEN MICKEY MANTLE SAT IN THERE 
WHITEY FORD SAT IN THERE 
AND I WAS CAREFUL CAREFUL NOT TO DISTURB ANYTHING 
LOOKED DOWN AT THE RED CLAY OF THE WARNING TRACK BUT IT WASN'T MY PLACE TO KICK IT AND TO MOVE IT AROUND 
I I WAS A VISITOR 
I WAS BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THIS 
AND WE GOT OUT TO DEAD CENTER FIELD WHERE THE MONUMENTS TO RUTH AND AND GEHRIG WERE 
AND I STOOD THERE AND SEVEN YEARS OLD AND I STARTED TO CRY 
AND PART OF IT WAS JUST THE SURROUNDINGS SO IMPRESSIVE THE FACADE THE THE ENORMITY OF THE PLACE 
A A SEVEN YEAR OLD KID LITERALLY COULD NOT SEE OVER THE MOUND FROM THAT DISTANCE 
HOME PLATE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A MILE AWAY 
THE PLACE WAS SO IMPOSING 
BUT ALSO I REALLY THOUGHT THAT THESE GUYS WERE BURIED THERE 
I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A SACRED YANKEE BURIAL GROUND 
AND SURELY WHEN PASSED AWAY WHEN MANTLE PASSED AWAY THEY'D BE BURIED THERE TOO 
AND MY FATHER TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO ME YES THESE MEN ARE DEAD BUT THEY'RE BURIED SOMEPLACE ELSE 
I WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT 
I WAS I WAS CONVINCED THAT THAT WAS THEIR TOMBSTONE 
IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT IS THE HAPPIEST MEMORY OF YOUR FATHER TO ME THAT DAY 
WE'RE BACK WITH KEN BURNS 
TELL ME WHY OTHER PEOPLE LOVE THIS SPORT SO MUCH AND WHAT IT MEANS 
BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT CIVIL WAR AS THE AND BASEBALL AS THE ODYSSEY 
WELL THE THE CIVIL WAR DEFINED US 
MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT 
IT'S THE GREAT EPIC BATTLE THAT DEFINED OUR NATION MADE IT WHAT IT IS TODAY 
AND THEREFORE THE THE WAR THE CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN CALLED THE AMERICAN 
I HAVE CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON BASEBALL AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE COUNTRY WE BECAME NOT AS A METAPHOR AS MUCH AS A MIRROR THAT BASEBALL REFLECTS ALL OUR TENDENCIES 
WALT WHITMAN FELT THIS RIGHT AT THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR 
HE SAID IT FITS INTO OUR LIFE AS SIGNIFICANTLY AS OUR 
SOMEHOW HE SAW SOMETHING IN THIS GAME 
AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF LOTS OF FACTORS 
IT'S A COMMUNITY GAME 
MM HM 
YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT TOGETHER 
IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED GAME UNLIKE ANY OTHER GAME 
THE DEFENSE HAS THE BALL 
RIGHT 
THERE'S NO CLOCK 
PEOPLE SCORE NOT THE BALL SCORE 
ALL OF THESE THINGS KIND OF CONSPIRE TO MAKE IT A A LITERARY GAME 
WHY HAVE POETS AND WRITERS AND EVERYONE BEEN DRAWN TO THIS GAME IF THERE ISN'T SOMETHING IN ITS INITIAL CONSTRUCTION THAT APPEALS 
AND THEN SINCE IT HAS ACCOMPANIED OUR NARRATIVE FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
YEAH 
WE CAN TIE AND MEASURE THE BENCHMARKS OF OUR OWN PERSONAL LIFE AND OUR LARGER NATIONAL LIFE BY WHAT'S GOING ON 
YOU KNOW IT YOU KNOW THE GREAT MOMENT WHEN WHEN JUSTICE POTTER STEWART IS HANDED A NOTE IN THE SUPREME COURT AND IT SAYS FLIES TO LEFT 
AGNEW RESIGNS 
THAT'S BASEBALL 
IT HAD THE PRIORITIES DID IT 
HERE IS WHAT WALT WHITMAN SAID 
WELL IT'S OUR GAME 
THAT'S THE CHIEF FACT IN CONNECTION WITH IT 
AMERICA'S GAME 
IT HAS THE SNAP GO OF THE AMERICAN ATMOSPHERE 
IT BELONGS AS MUCH TO OUR INSTITUTIONS FITS INTO THEM AS SIGNIFICANTLY AS OUR CONSTITUTION'S LAWS 
IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT IN THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR HISTORIC LIFE 
IT'S DID IT CHANGE HOW HAS IT CHANGED AND AND WHY IN THIS FILM HAVE YOU FOCUSED SO MUCH ON THE CENTRALITY OF RACE IN THE EVOLUTION OF BASEBALL 
THIS IS OUR CENTRAL STORY AS A COUNTRY 
WE ARE FOUNDED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO ON THE MOST NOBLE PRINCIPLE YET ADVANCED IN HUMANKIND THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL 
YET THE MEN WHO DISTILLED THE ESSENCE OF THE AND PUT IT INTO THAT MAGNIFICENT SENTENCE OWNED SLAVES 
MM 
AND FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO WE FOUGHT A WAR AND KILLED TWO PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION AND STILL DIDN'T DECIDE ULTIMATELY IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN THAT THERE WAS ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL 
AND SO IT BECOMES THE CENTRAL THREAD 
AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING AS I AM WHAT MAKES OUR COUNTRY TICK WHO WE ARE THEN YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT RACE IS THE CENTRAL THING 
AS YOU LOOK AT BASEBALL BASEBALL'S FINEST MOMENT IS WHEN JACKIE ROBINSON COMES UP 
IT IS THE FIRST PROGRESS IN CIVIL RIGHTS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR AND IT OCCURS NOT WHERE WE THINK THESE THINGS OCCUR 
IT OCCURS ON THE DIAMONDS OF OUR SO CALLED NATIONAL PASTIME 
AND AS YOU BEGIN TO DIG A LITTLE BIT FURTHER YOU FIND OUT THAT TWO YEARS AFTER TWO PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION DIED SUPPOSEDLY SETTLING THE ISSUE THE ALL BLACK TEAM OF PHILADELPHIA NOT A SOUTHERN TEAM OF PHILADELPHIA ARE DENIED MEMBERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BASEBALL PLAYERS 
AND FROM THEN ON WE HAVE EXCLUDED OR FOUND A WAY TO EXCLUDE OR TO PUNISH AFRICAN AMERICANS IN BASEBALL IN MUCH THE SAME WAYS WE HAVE PUNISHED THEM IN OUR LARGER SOCIETY 
SO BY IN A SENSE WHERE YOU COULD FIND THE UNIVERSE IN A GRAIN OF SAND YOU STUDY BASEBALL YOU STUDY OURSELF 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CLIP 
THIS IS JACKIE ROBINSON'S ENTRY INTO MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
HERE IT IS 
HISTORY WAS MADE HERE TUESDAY AFTERNOON IN FLAG FIELD WHEN SMILING JACKIE ROBINSON TROTTED OUT ON THE GREEN SWEPT DIAMOND WITH THE REST OF HIS DODGER TEAMMATES 
NO LESS THAN FIFTEEN PHOTOGRAPHERS SURROUNDED ROBINSON BEFORE THE GAME AND CLICKED HIS PICTURE FROM EVERY POSITION IMAGINABLE 
PITTSBURGH COURIER 
ON APRIL FIFTEENTH NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN AT FIELD IN FLATBUSH IN THE BOROUGH OF BROOKLYN IN NEW YORK CITY THE BROOKLYN DODGERS FACED THE BOSTON BRAVES 
IT WAS OPENING DAY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN MAJOR LEAGUE HISTORY A BLACK MAN JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON WAS STARTING THE GAME AT FIRST BASE 
THERE WERE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE FANS IN THE STANDS 
MORE THAN HALF OF THEM BLACK COME TO SEE JACKIE ROBINSON 
ALTHOUGH ROBINSON WENT IN THREE TRIPS TO THE PLATE JUST THE SIGHT OF HIM STIRRED THE CROWD 
CLEARLY TO KNOW YOU AND TO KNOW ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE CIVIL WAR ONE OF YOUR GREAT HEROES IS ABE LINCOLN 
IS THE HERO FOR YOU OF BASEBALL JACKIE ROBINSON 
YEAH AND I DIDN'T GO IN PLANNING IT THAT WAY 
HE SNUCK UP ON ME 
I KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE A CENTRAL FIGURE BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IN A WAY HOW POWERFUL THE EMOTIONAL IS TO BASEBALL 
I MEAN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE BROAD THEMES TILL YOU'RE BLUE IN THE FACE BUT REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO VERY POWERFUL EMOTIONS THAT CONNECT ME TO YOU AND 
MM 
TO OTHERS ABOUT TIME ABOUT MEMORY ABOUT FAMILY AND ABOUT HOME 
AND JACKIE'S STORY SEEMS TO ADD THIS CENTRAL AMERICAN FAULT LINE ABOUT RACE TO IT AND DOES IT MAGNIFICENTLY 
HE WAS ASKED BY BRANCH RICKEY AS YOU KNOW TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK FOR THREE YEARS 
FOR THREE YEARS 
IN THE FACE OF WITHERING WITHERING RACIAL INSIGHT INSULTS AND ABUSE 
AND HE DID SO MAGNIFICENTLY 
HE TRANSFORMED WHITE BASEBALL 
HE BROUGHT THE NEGRO LEAGUE STYLE OF PLAY HIT AND RUN BASE STEALING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BATTLE BETWEEN THE PITCHER AND THE BASE RUNNER NOT JUST THE BATTER 
HE BROUGHT THE FLAVOR OF THE NEGRO LEAGUE GAME TO BASEBALL BUT HE DID IT CARRYING ON HIS SHOULDERS THIS REMARKABLE BURDEN 
THEY PUT BLACK CATS ON THE FIELD 
THEY'D SCREAM AT HIM THEY'D LAY OPEN THEIR HIS THIGHS WITH THEIR SPIKES 
AND HE ESSENTIALLY SET THE TONE AND THE CHARACTER OF THE UPCOMING CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT A COMBINATION OF FORBEARANCE BUT ALSO A SENSE OF MILITANCY THAT IT WAS GOING TO COME AROUND 
NO MAN HAS EVER PLAYED THE GAME WHO PLAYED IT WITH MORE DIGNITY 
MORE DIGNITY 
AS HE DID 
CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO HOLD IT IN 
PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PLAY BASEBALL ANGRY 
YOU HAVE TO BE RELAXED 
AND HERE'S A MAN HAVING TO HOLD IN EVERYTHING 
HE'S ONE OF THE GREAT STORIES 
I MEAN GERALD EARLY WHO'S THE HEAD OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN SAINT LOUIS SAYS YOU CAN MEASURE AMERICAN HISTORY BEFORE ROBINSON AND AFTER ROBINSON 
IT'S THAT MUCH OF A SEA CHANGE AND WE SAY OH THIS OCCURS IN OUR GAME 
WELL THIS GAME IS A FANTASTIC INTERSECTION OF FACT THE STATISTICS WHO WON 
YEAH 
LOST AND METAPHOR WHAT IT MEANS 
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT A GAME IS 
INTERESTING HIS WIFE IN THE STANDS WHO'S ALIVE AND LIVES HERE IN NEW YORK HAD TO STAND AND SHIELD HIM 
SHE 
SHE HAD SHE HAD PROMISED BRANCH RICKEY THAT SHE WOULD WAS ALSO UNDER THE SAME CONSTRAINTS AND SHE COULDN'T YELL SHE COULDN'T DEFEND HER HUSBAND 
AND CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS RELATIVELY SMALL WOMAN SITTING IN THE STANDS FEELING THE ANGER BEING HURLED AT HER HUSBAND 
I MEAN THE FOCUS OF WE CAN'T EVEN APPRECIATE HOW BAD IT WAS 
AND HOPING SOMEHOW THAT HER BODY WOULD INTERCEPT THAT SHE COULD WIDEN OUT FAR ENOUGH 
IF THAT ISN'T A SYMBOL OF OF OF HIS GREATNESS AND HERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS 
FOR YOU JACKIE ROBINSON IS THE GREATEST PLAYER BECAUSE OF ALL THIS NOT ONLY A GREAT PLAYER BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'S 
I THINK HE'S A REAL HERO 
AND HOW A TRUE HERO 
YEAH 
YOU MAKE THE POINT ACTUALLY IN CONVERSATION THAT THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN CELEBRITY 
YEAH 
WHO DOES SOMETHING WELL ON AN ATHLETIC FIELD AND A TRUE HERO WHO ROBINSON DID SOMETHING WELL ON THE ATHLETIC FIELD AND WAS CELEBRATED FOR IT BUT CARRIED A MUCH DEEPER AND STRONGER 
WE CONFUSE IN OUR SOCIETY CELEBRITY AND HEROISM 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY VERY DIFFERENT 
THERE ARE BASEBALL HEROES 
THE MEN WHO KNOW HOW TO HIT THE BALL JOE AND WILLIE MAYS AND BABE RUTH AND LOU GEHRIG AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WHO TAKE THEIR GREAT SKILL AS BASEBALL PLAYERS AND ADD SOMETHING MORE 
AND THAT'S A JACKIE ROBINSON THAT'S A KURT FLOOD THAT'S A CHRISTY AND A LOU GEHRIG AT TIMES 
THAT'S A BRANCH RICKEY 
WHERE THEY ARE CALLED ON TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EXPECTED OF THEM 
IT'S A TED WILLIAMS WHO WHEN HE IS INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME IN HIS FIRST YEAR OF ELIGIBILITY STANDS UP THERE AND SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SATCHEL AND JOSH GIBSON HERE AND THEY ARE NOT HERE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT GET A CHANCE 
THAT'S HEROISM 
WHEN IN HIS MOMENT OF GLORY WHEN THE GREATEST HITTER WHO EVER LIVED COULD QUITE RIGHTFULLY BASK IN HIS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS HE TOOK THE TIME TO SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WHO WERE NOT SPOKEN FOR AND THEN HELPED INITIATE THE MOVE TOWARDS THE INCLUSION OF NEGRO LEAGUE PLAYERS IN THE HALL OF FAME 
YOU MENTIONED TED WILLIAMS 
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER GREAT HEROES THAT ARE IN THIS FILM AND A PART OF THE AMERICAN HISTORY AND A PART OF BASEBALL 
COBB 
HE IS 
THE MAN THAT SOME SAY IS THE GREATEST PLAYER EVER TO PLAY THE GAME 
HE MAY 
WHO SAW HIS RECORD BROKEN BY PETE ROSE WHO BROUGHT SOME SENSE OF SCANDAL TO THE GAME 
HE IS THE MOST INTERESTING PERSON THAT I GOT TO KNOW IN THE COURSE OF THIS SERIES 
TERRIFYING 
HE LIKE JACKIE IS 
GOT TO KNOW IN TERMS OF HE'S DEAD BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW HIM BECAUSE IN THE WAY YOU GET TO KNOW ABRAHAM LINCOLN 
SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT WHAT I DO IS I WAKE THE DEAD 
YES 
AND I THINK IT MUST BE FOR MY OWN PERSONAL REASONS BUT SOMEHOW WHEN YOU WORK ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS YOU GET TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE AND FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW THEM 
COBB AND ROBINSON BOTH COME FROM RURAL GEORGIA BOTH HAVE TERRIFIC TEMPERS AND THERE THE SIMILARITIES END 
THE BLACK MAN JACKIE ROBINSON MAKES THE MOST HEROIC GESTURE IN THE HISTORY OF BASEBALL 
COBB JUST WAS A BUNDLE OF ANGER VIRULENT RACISM AND IT WAS WITH HIM HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET IT PRODUCED GREAT BASEBALL 
AND FINALLY AT THE END YOU SAY AT WHAT COST BUT HE IS HE UP PAGE AFTER PAGE OF HISTORY 
WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN WHEN YOU MENTION SOMEONE LIKE COBB BECAUSE HE IS OFTEN PART OF A FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY 
PETE ROSE AND WHETHER HE SHOULD BE IN THE HALL OF FAME 
SOMEHOW WE AND THE BROAD SENSE OF MEDIA HAVE BECOME SO SANCTIMONIOUS LIKE THE COLONIAL ELDERS WHO PAINT THE SCARLET LETTER A. HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY DENY PETE ROSE DESPITE ALL OF HIS PROBLEMS AND HIS FOIBLES AND HIS FAULT ENTRY INTO THE HALL OF FAME 
IF WE WERE TO DO THAT WE NEED TO RETROACTIVELY GO BACK AND TAKE OUT BABE RUTH 
WE CERTAINLY HAVE TO TAKE OUT COBB AND PROBABLY HALF THE MEMBERS WOULDN'T SURVIVE A KIND OF SANCTIMONIOUS AND MORALISTIC SCRUTINY THAT WE APPLY NOW 
PUT PETE ROSE IN 
I'M GLAD IF IF A JURY OF HIS PEERS FOUND HIM GUILTY OF TAX EVASION AND WHATEVER IT IS HE GOES TO JAIL AND PAYS FOR THAT CRIME BUT LET'S HONOR HIM FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS HE HAS MORE HITS 
DO YOU THINK YOUR POINT OF VIEW REPRESENTS THE THE MAJORITY OPINION OF PEOPLE WHO WILL VOTE FOR HIS ELECTION INTO THE HALL OF FAME 
I HOPE IT CHANGE 
I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DISCOMFORT I I'M BEGINNING TO PERCEIVE THAT I HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY HE'LL COME IN 
BECAUSE WE CAN'T THE HALL OF FAME CAN'T BE AN OF MORAL CHARACTER IT HAS TO BE AN OF BASEBALL EXCELLENCE 
I WOULD AS WHO DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO THAT'S NOT AMONG THE SEVENTY 
JOE I THINK 
WHY DID HE SAY NO 
WELL I JUST THINK HE WAS SORT OF 
I MEAN WE MADE THE USUAL INQUIRIES AND 
AND YOU HAD ALL THE PEOPLE WHO COULD GET TO HIM 
OH YEAH AND WE WE 
AS PART OF THE FILM 
MADE THE THINGS AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE AND I DON'T WANT TO I DIDN'T WANT TO PUSH 
I DIDN'T I DIDN'T PUSH IT 
WE HAD WE HAVE TED WILLIAMS AND HE'S FANTASTIC AND MICKEY MANTLE IS AMAZING AND OLD NEGRO LEAGUE STARS WHO BRING THEIR STORY THEIR NOW WORLD HISTORY ALIVE 
BUT I WOULD'VE WANTED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE CLIPPER AND 
YEAH 
YET THERE ARE MANY WHO TOLD ME LOOK YOU DON'T NEED IT 
I MEAN WE HANDLE HIM WELL 
YEAH BUT THAT THAT'S YOU WANTED IT 
BUT YOU 
BADLY 
I WANT TO 
YOU BECAUSE IT'S LIKE 
I WANT TO SIT THERE AND FEEL WHAT THAT IS ABOUT HIM AND 
BUT HOW BUT DID HE JUST SIMPLY SAY I DON'T 
YEAH 
WANT TO DO IT WITH EXPLANATION OR 
NUMBER 
IT WAS 
JUST NO 
JUST NO 
IT WAS JUST NO 
AND HOW HARD DID YOU PUSH 
NOT HARD 
I I REALLY I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT KIND OF I'M NOT IN A KIND OF NEWS RELATIONSHIP 
NO I KNOW BUT 
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO WANT TO DO IT 
AND TED SAID YES 
I MEAN HE WAS VERY HARD TO GET A HOLD OF BUT ONCE HE'D SEEN THE CIVIL WAR HE SAID YES AND WE CAME AND WE HAD A REMARKABLE CONVERSATION 
YEAH 
ANYONE ELSE 
NUMBER 
THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS REALLY WOULD'VE MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION 
NUMBER 
THAT YOU COULDN'T 
NO WELL YOU KNOW WHO I WOULD'VE IN THE NON BALL PLAYER 
YEAH 
IS LOTS OF WRITERS YOU 
YEAH 
KNOW 
I FINALLY HAD TO SAY HOW DO I DECIDE SO I TOOK THE WASHINGTON POST AND I SAID I'LL DO SHIRLEY AND TOM BOSWELL

WITH RED BARBER 
BECAUSE YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT HIS HEALTH 
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND I WENT SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR WAS OUT TO TALLAHASSEE 
YEAH 
AND HE ACTUALLY LIVED SEVERAL MORE YEARS BUT I I MEAN HE HE WAS THE PERSON THAT I NEEDED TO GO AND SEE FIRST 
AND HE'S FANTASTIC 
THERE IS A MOMENT WHEN HE DESCRIBES A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH BRANCH RICKEY TELLING HIM ABOUT WHY HE WAS GOING TO BRING A BLACK MAN AND HE GOES THIS I KNOW 
AND WHEN I'M IN AN INTERVIEW I USUALLY AM A BLANK 
I JUST LISTEN I TRY TO SOAK IT UP 
YEAH 
AND I SAID AT THAT MOMENT I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO IN THE FILM 
I KNOW THERE'LL BE A TITLE THAT SAYS THIS I KNOW AND IT WILL INITIATE WHAT WILL BE THE DRAMATIC CENTERPIECE OF THIS SERIES WHICH IS THE ARRIVAL OF JACKIE ROBINSON 
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PROCESS 
DO YOU KNOW I MEAN HAVE YOU READ EVERYTHING AND TALKED TO EVERYBODY BEFORE YOU SIT DOWN OR

THE MIDDLE OF KANSAS 
IN THE MIDDLE OF KANSAS 
AND THAT SAYS IT ALL 
THIS IN AN AGE OF CONSUMPTION HE'S THE GREATEST CONSUMER OF THEM ALL 
AND JOHN GOODMAN IN THE FLAWED PORTRAIT AND WILLIAM IN THE PORTRAIT 
MM HM 
DO NOT DO JUSTICE TO THIS COMPLICATED MAN 
AND I HAVE 
WHY WAS HE COMPLICATED 
WHAT WAS COMPLICATED 
HIS BIRTH 
ABOUT BABE RUTH 
HE HE GREW UP IN A IN A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY 
THEY PUT HIM IN A REFORM SCHOOL 
HE WAS CALLED NIGGER LIPS 
HE WAS BELITTLED 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE LEARNED FROM AN IRISH PRIEST HOW TO HIT A BASEBALL WITH A STICK AND HE IS PRODIGIOUS 
WHAT DID HE HAVE 
I MEAN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT LOOK HE DOES NOT HAVE THE LOOK OF A GREAT ATHLETE 
NO HE DOESN'T 
BUT HE HAD THE CAPACITY 
HE COULD HIT 
FIRST AS A PITCHER 
FIRST AS A PITCHER 
HE YOU KNOW AND IF YOU WERE TO STOP TIME IN NINETEEN TWENTY YOU WOULD RECORD BABE RUTH AS THE FINEST LEFT HANDED PITCHER IN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE 
YEAH 
IN THE NINETEEN TEENS 
PITCHING FOR THE BOSTON RED SOX 
AND THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT 
AS DAN SAID IT'S LIKE HE'S HE'S LIKE BEETHOVEN AND CEZANNE IN ONE PERSON BECAUSE 
YEAH 
THEN HE SWITCHES OVER AND BECOMES THE GREATEST POWER HITTER AND THE GREATEST PLAYER IN THE GAME 
I MEAN ALL ALL THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE CAN HAVE ABOUT WHO'S THE BEST IT ALWAYS HAS TO BE AFTER RUTH A A A TALENT THAT IS SO REMARKABLE 
THE WAY HE DOMINATED THE GAME 
I MEAN WE THINK OF MICHAEL JORDAN AND MUHAMMAD ALI AS AS BEING A FIGURE BEYOND THEIR SPORT 
DOES EVERYBODY SAY HIS LIKE WILL NEVER COME 
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY 
THE COMBINATION OF THE JOIE DE ALONE 
YEAH 
YOU KNOW HE NEVER HE WOULDN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME

THOMAS JEFFERSON 
AND AFTER THAT LEWIS AND CLARK 
I MEAN YOU GO FROM A GREAT THINKER TO GREAT EXPLORERS 
WHO WHO ELSE EMERGES FROM THIS FOR YOU AS CHARACTERS WE OUGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF 
WELL AT 
IN THIS CONVERSATION 
AT THE END OF THIS THING YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW SIXTY OR SEVENTY PEOPLE 
RIGHT 
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW SIXTY OR SEVENTY EVENTS 
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A A FAN THEY'RE GOING SORT OF GUIDES TO AN AMERICAN SOUL THAT I'M INTERESTED IN PURSUING 
BUT I'M DRAWN TO JOHN MCGRAW 
I'M DRAWN TO CHRISTY 
JOHN MCGRAW IS A MANAGER 
A MANAGER AND A A THIRD BASEMAN FOR THE BALTIMORE ORIOLES AND THE NEW YORK MANAGER AND THIS FIERY TEMPERAMENT AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX FIGURE WHO WHEN HE DIED HIS WIFE FOUND AMONG HIS EFFECTS A LIST OF ALL THE BLACK PLAYERS HE HAD SECRETLY WISHED HE COULD HIRE OVER THE YEARS

WHO HAS THIS GREAT MOMENT OF GLORY IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY SIX WORLD SERIES WHEN HE STRIKES OUT TONY 
HOW ABOUT KURT FLOOD 
KURT FLOOD IS I THINK AFTER ROBINSON AND AARON OF THE BLACK STARS THE ONE I'M REALLY DRAWN TO IN THIS SERIES 
HERE IS A MAN WHO SUFFERED ALL OF THE OF ROBINSON BUT DID SO AFTER IT WAS OVER SO NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION ANY MORE 
HE PLAYS MAGNIFICENTLY THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES AND IN SIXTY NINE HE IS TRADED TO THE AND HE SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO GO 
AND 
YOU DON'T OWN ME 
HE YOU DO NOT OWN ME 
I AM NOT A PIECE OF PROPERTY KUHN 
I AM A NOW IT'S HOW IRONIC THAT THIS PLANTATION SYSTEM OF THE RESERVE CLAUSE SHOULD FIRST BE LEGITIMATELY TESTED IN THIS CENTURY BY A BLACK MAN SAYING I AM A MAN 
AND HE FALLS ON HIS SWORD 
HE HE DOESN'T PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND IT WILL TAKE MARVIN MILLER AND THE OF GETTING COLLECTIVE BAR OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND A THIRD TO TO AND A TEST CASE AND MCNALLY TO MAKE TO BREAK THE RESERVE CLAUSE AND ESTABLISH FREE AGENCY 
YEAH

HOW'RE YOU DOING I'D SAY HEY JOE GOOD TO SEE YOU 
WELL WHAT HAPPENED YOU WERE PART OF THE COMMUNITY 
THE BASEBALL PARK YOU WAS IN CLOSE YOU WALKED RIGHT BY THE STANDS AND EVERYBODY KNEW YOUR NAME AND YOU'D TALK TO 'EM BEFORE THE GAME AND AFTER THE GAME AND THE FANS LOOKED AT THE GUYS IN OUR LEAGUE AS HEROES 
BUT NOBODY HAD A BIG HEAD 
EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS THERE AND READY TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH THE FANS SIGN AUTOGRAPHS WHATEVER THEY WANTED WE WERE A PART OF IT 
WE WERE HAPPY TO DO IT BECAUSE WE ALL REALLY LOVED AND AND RESPECT EACH OTHER 
WITH THE KANSAS CITY MONARCHS WE STAYED IN THE BEST HOTELS IN THE WORLD 
THEY JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN BLACK HOTELS 
WE ATE AT THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN THE WORLD 
THEY JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN BLACK OWNED AND OPERATED 
WELL ORGANIZED 
KANSAS CITY I'D LIKE SOME MAJOR LEAGUE 
JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN BLACK 
O'NEIL WOULD STAY WITH THE MONARCHS FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS BECOMING THEIR MANAGER LEADING THEM TO FIVE MORE NEGRO LEAGUE AND TWO CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE BLACK WORLD SERIES 
I WANT TO DO ONE OTHER THING WHILE WE'RE HERE AND IT IS TO PRESENT WITHOUT NAMES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE WITHOUT KNOWING THE NAMES SOME OF THEM WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT BUT THIS IS A PIECE FROM THE FILM IN WHICH YOU HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST HEROES 
ROLL THE TAPE AND YOU'LL HEAR WITH JOHN THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS THE NATIONAL PASTIME 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX TWO NEW STARS MADE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCES IN THE BIG LEAGUES 
THE FIRST WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD FAST BALL PITCHER FROM IOWA WHOSE FATHER HAD BUILT HIM HIS OWN PRACTICE FIELD 
HE WAS SIGNED BY THE CLEVELAND INDIANS AND IN HIS VERY FIRST START HE STRUCK OUT FIFTEEN SAINT LOUIS BROWNS 
A FEW WEEKS LATER HE SET AN AMERICAN LEAGUE RECORD BY STRIKING OUT SEVENTEEN A'S 
THEN HE WENT BACK HOME TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL 
HIS NAME WAS BOB 
WE WENT TO THE WORLD SERIES IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR IN SAINT LOUIS AND SAW THE GAS HOUSE GANG AND I THOUGHT RIGHT THEN AND THERE THAT I WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THAT MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WASN'T THAT FAR AWAY 
AND NOT BEING COCKY I HAD A LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
MY FATHER GAVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
BUT I NEVER WAS AFRAID OF A BATTER ON THE MOUND 
THEY MAY HIT ME HIT ME WELL BUT I WAS NEVER AFRAID OF THEM 
IMAGINE BOB SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD IN THE SMALL FARMING TOWN OF VAN METER IOWA THROWING AGAINST THE PROVERBIAL WALL OF THE BARN AND HAVING A FAST BALL THAT COULD BEAT ANY IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE AT THAT TIME 
BASEBALL STORIES ARE SO VARIOUS AND THEY SWAP CHARACTERS IN THEM BUT THE WAY I HEARD IT LEFTY HIMSELF A PITCHER FACED THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOBBY 
THE FIRST ONE CAME OVER AND THE UMPIRE CALLED A STRIKE 
AND THE SECOND ONE CAME OVER 
HE CALLED A STRIKE 
AND THE THIRD ONE CAME OVER THE UMPIRE CALLED A STRIKE AND SAID I THOUGHT THAT LAST ONE SOUNDED A LITTLE LOW 
ALWAYS LOOK FOR HEROES 
ALWAYS THE PEOPLE LOOK UP TO SEE SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THEM THAT IS LARGER THAN THEY ARE AND IF IT'S PERFECT THAT THEY MIGHT BECOME 
AS A YOUNG BOY WHEN I WAS TAKEN TO MY FIRST GAME AT YANKEE STADIUM MY GOD 
YANKEE STADIUM 
TALK ABOUT AWESOME SIGHTS TO SEE JOE WHOSE NAME HAD THAT HAPPY COMBINATION OF THAT MINE HAD TO WHOM YOU COULD RELATE WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO OR OR ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM 
BUT HE WAS AN ITALIAN AMERICAN 
HE WAS A BASEBALL PLAYER 
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY OTHER BUT HIS ABILITY AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIM A GREAT HERO AND A GREAT SUCCESS AND THEREFORE A GREAT INSPIRATION 
THE SECOND ROOKIE THAT SUMMER OF NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WAS A YOUNG YANKEE OUTFIELDER FROM SAN FRANCISCO JOE 
AT SEVENTEEN HE HAD BROKEN IN WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO SEALS AT SHORTSTOP AND WAS MOVED TO CENTER FIELD AFTER COMMITTING ELEVEN WILD THROWS IN A SINGLE EXHIBITION GAME 
BUT HE HIT SAFELY IN SIXTY ONE STRAIGHT GAMES IN HIS FIRST YEAR IN THE MINORS AND BATTED THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT IN HIS THIRD 
THE PRESS WAS READY WHEN HE JOINED THE MAJORS AND HE DID NOT DISAPPOINT HITTING TWENTY NINE AND KNOCKING IN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE RUNS IN HIS ROOKIE SEASON 
WAS THE PERFECT COMPLEMENT TO LOU GEHRIG 
HE WOULD HELP LEAD THE YANKEES TO FOUR CONSECUTIVE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT BABE RUTH AND ROW HAD NEVER EVEN APPROACHED 
NOW FREED FROM RUTH'S SHADOW GEHRIG WAS SPECTACULAR 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX HE HIT FORTY NINE HOME RUNS DROVE IN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO RUNS AND WAS NAMED THE LEAGUE'S MOST VALUABLE PLAYER 
HE ALSO KEPT ALIVE HIS EXTRAORDINARY RECORD OF CONSECUTIVE GAMES PLAYED 
THE YANKEES LOOKED UNBEATABLE 
LET ME COME BACK NOW 
THIS IS DIVIDED INTO INNINGS AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE 
THE FOURTH INNING WAS BABE RUTH 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIFTH INNING WHICH IS ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND COVERS THE DEPRESSION YEARS RUTH'S FADING CAREER A NEW GENERATION OF STARS WILLIAMS AND AND THE PARALLEL WORLD OF THE NEGRO LEAGUE 
SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTH FIFTH IS THE SIXTH INNING NINETEEN FORTY TO NINETEEN FIFTY THE GREAT YEARS OF WILLIAMS AND 
WAS THERE ONE GREAT GAME FOR YOU ONE GREAT SERIES FOR YOU AS A FAN AS A FILMMAKER 
AS A FAN IT'S SEVENTY FIVE THE SEVENTY FIVE 
RED SOX 
SERIES 
IT BROUGHT ME BACK INTO 
AND THE RED SOX AND THE REDS IS IT 
WHO WAS IT 
THE RED SOX AND THE CINCINNATI REDS 
RIGHT 
IT GOES TO SEVEN GAMES 
THE REDS TRIUMPH 
BUT IN THE SIXTH GAME THE UNDERDOG BOSTON RED SOX COME BACK THEY TIE IT UP WHEN THE GAME IS SEEMINGLY LOST 
IT GOES INTO EXTRA INNINGS 
THERE ARE TWO SPECTACULAR DEFENSIVE PLAYS ON BOTH SIDES A PLAY AT THE PLATE WHERE THE RED SOCK WHO'S SCORING WOULD GIVE THEM THE WINNING RUN IS THROWN OUT 
DEWEY EVANS MAKES A SPECTACULAR CATCH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT COMES UP AND AND CARLTON FISK STEPS UP TO THE PLATE 
YEAH 
AND HITS THIS HOME RUN WHICH WE KNOW HIS BODY FAIR FOR THAT WAS AS DAN SAID A MOMENT THAT BROUGHT MANY PEOPLE BACK TO THE NATIONAL PASTIME 
WHAT ABOUT THE MUSIC IN THE FILM 
WELL IT'S ON SEVERAL LAYERS 
IT'S GOT THE TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIP TO MUSIC THAT I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED WHICH IS TAKING THE OLD FOLK MUSIC IN THIS CASE MANY OLD BASEBALL TUNES THAT WE DISCOVERED AT THE HALL OF FAME AND REARRANGING THEM 
BUT IT IS ALSO BECAUSE WE COVER SO MUCH TERRITORY A HISTORY OF AMERICAN MUSIC FROM PARLOR MUSIC TO JAZZ TO DIXIELAND DUKE ELLINGTON LESTER YOUNG EARLY ROCK AND ROLL R. AND B. HARD ROCK 
AND HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HEAR TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME 
WE MUST HEAR IT SIXTY OR SEVENTY TIMES FROM COCKTAIL MUSIC TO NEW VERSIONS BY CARLY SIMON TO AMAZING AMAZING UPBEAT VERSIONS 
SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTH IS SEVENTH INNING NINETEEN FIFTY NINETEEN SIXTY 
THE CAPITOL OF BASEBALL CELEBRATES THE DOMINATION OF NEW YORK CITY BASEBALL 
WELL I WAS EDITING AND I REALIZED THAT THE FIFTIES I WAS GOING TO CALL IT THE BEST THAT EVER WAS BECAUSE NOW WITH THE BLACK PLAYERS UP THERE I FEEL THAT THE GAME WAS THE BEST IT EVER WAS BEGINNING THEN 
BUT I REALIZED THAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT NEW YORK AND SUDDENLY I DECIDED TO TURN WHAT SEEMED TO BE 
BASEBALL WAS ABOUT NEW YORK THEN 
IT WAS ABOUT NEW YORK AND THE GIANTS AND THE YANKEES AND THE DODGERS WROTE BASEBALL HISTORY YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT AND DID SO WITH AN AN IMPORTANCE THAT I'M BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE ONLY NOW 
WHEN YOU THINK THAT WHEN THE DODGERS AND GIANTS FAR LEFT SOMETHING WENT OUT OF THE CITY IT CERTAINLY WENT OUT OF BROOKLYN 
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT THAT EXTRA THING IS THE IDENTITY THAT A TEAM BRINGS A TOWN IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T FEEL NOW 
WHO ARE THE CONTEMPORARY PLAYERS THOSE THAT ARE PLAYING THE GAME NOW WHO ARE IN THE FILM 
VERY VERY FEW 
WE THE LAST INNING IS CALLED HOME AND IT GOES FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY TO THE 
RIGHT 
PRESENT AND WE HAVE WILLIE AND THE AND AND PETE ROSE AND SOME OF THE SCANDALS AND WE REALLY SLOW DOWN THIS THING 
I'M IN A I'M A HISTORIAN 
I DO OR AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN AND I DON'T LIKE TO TO DEAL WITH THE JOURNALISTIC RECENT PAST BUT WE GO RIGHT UP TO THE CARTER AND THE TORONTO BLUE WINNING THE WORLD SERIES AND MAKING IT TRULY A WORLD SERIES BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES AND NOT ONE 
YEAH 
AND SORT OF THAT IN 
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THEM 
I THINK THE NEW I THINK THE GAME RIGHT NOW HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER 
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT 
I I THINK WE'RE SEEING TALENT EQUAL TO ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE LIKE AND AND THOMAS 
THOMAS 
AND WILLIAMS 
I THINK WE'RE SEEING GREAT PITCHING 
REMEMBER WE'VE GONE THROUGH AN ERA OF PARODY LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
WE'VE ONLY SEEN A COUPLE OF REPEATS MINNESOTA AND AND AND TORONTO 
AND THERE WAS ONE YE TEN YEAR PERIOD WHEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT TEAM EVERY YEAR AND LAST PLACE TEAMS WOULD COME TO TO FIRST 
GREAT PITCHERS LIKE YOU KNOW MADDUX 
I MEAN THIS IS A GREAT GREAT PERIOD WHICH MAKES THE PAIN OF THE CURRENT LABOR STUFF ALL THE MORE POIGNANT FOR ME 
WE OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE BASEBALL THIS YEAR 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A WORLD SERIES AND SOME SAY THAT WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE BASEBALL IF AT ALL NEXT YEAR UNTIL AFTER THE MID SEASON BREAK 
WHAT IS IT THAT BRINGS YOU THE MOST PAIN TO KNOW THAT 
CHARLIE SAID THAT BASEBALL WAS THE BACKGROUND MUSIC OF AMERICA AND I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING FOR THE SERIES TO GO OUT WITH THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IN THE FACT THAT EVEN IF YOU SAID OH WELL I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE TEAMS 
I'M GOING TO TURN ON THE GAME THAT YOU COULD FIND IN THE MOMENTS OF THE GAME THE INTERSECTIONS THE INTERVALS AND THIS IS A GAME DAN SAID ABOUT PONDERING INACTION 
AS YOU LOOK AT THE PITCHER 
MM HM 
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO THROW THIS GUY OR WHERE ARE THE GOING TO POSITION THEMSELVES 
WHERE IS THE CUTOFF 
IT HAS A DIFFERENT PACE THAN ANY OTHER SPORT 
NOTHING ELSE 
THAT AS YOU PONDER THIS INACTION THAT THE PROOF OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY ABOUT THE GAME IS THERE AND THAT I MISS IT 
YOU KNOW BOSWELL SAID THE SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
TOM BOSWELL 
OF THE WASHINGTON POST 
HE SAID THE SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR WHEN THERE'S BASEBALL IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
THERE'S SOMETHING MORE IN OUR LIVES 
I FEEL THAT TOO 
I MEAN I WAS YESTERDAY I WAS SITTING IN A DIAMOND NEXT TO A DIAMOND IN VIRGINIA TALKING TO SOMEBODY A REPORTER WHO DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT BASEBALL THAT MUCH 
AND THERE WAS A PRACTICE GOING ON AND I FELT A TIDAL PULL TO GET INTO IT 
AND I SAID YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT MY BODY IS BEING DRAWN INTO THIS GAME THAT I WANT NOT TO SO MUCH WATCH I WANT TO GET OUT THERE 
YOU'VE HAD THE JOY OF THROWING OUT THE FIRST BALL THAT ONCE OR TWICE OR 
ABOUT EIGHT TIMES 
SO WHY DO YOU GET TO DO IT 
IT'S THIS 
SO MUCH 
I MEAN 
WELL WE'VE BEEN ON THIS TOUR 
YEAH 
AND AND AND TO STAND ON THE MOUND IN A 
DO WE HAVE A VIDEOTAPE OF THAT 
I WILL FIND YOU ONE 
I MEAN DO YOU 
YES 
LEARN FINALLY TO GET IT RIGHT 
YEAH 
WELL THE FIRST TIME I THREW A PERFECT STRIKE AND THE CATCHER JUST WENT HUH 
YEAH 
AND HE WALKED OUT 
HE SAYS THAT'S THE FIRST STRIKE I'VE HAD ALL YEAR BECAUSE THERE ARE THE USUAL 
RIGHT 
LIKE KEN BURNS OUT THERE 
RIGHT RIGHT 
BOUNCING THE PITCHES 
AND THE NEXT DAY I GOT COCKY AT JACOBS FIELD AND I BOUNCED THE BALL 
THE NEXT DAY AT MEMORIAL STA 
JACOBS FIELD IS IS CLEVELAND 
IT'S CLEVELAND 
IT'S A 
RIGHT 
BEAUTIFUL FIELD 
NEW 
THEN I WAS IN COUNTY STADIUM IN MILWAUKEE 
AND I'VE BEEN THROWING STRIKES MORE OR LESS 
BUCK SAYS 
DOES BUCK GO WITH YOU TO THROW THESE STRIKES 
YEAH 
BUCK WAS AT THE BEST MOMENT OF THIS SUMMER IS THAT I THREW OUT THE FIRST BALL ON AUGUST THIRD AT ROYAL STADIUM WHEN THE ROYALS DAN THE UNIFORM OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR CHAMPION KANSAS CITY MONARCHS AND EVEN THE SCOREBOARD SAID THE ATHLETICS VERSUS THE MONARCHS AND THEY PLAYED IN THE BAGGY PANTS OF 
YEAH 
WOOL UNIFORMS AND THEY BROUGHT BACK ALL THESE OLD MONARCHS TO CELEBRATE AND I THREW OUT THE FIRST PITCH TO BUCK 
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MYTHS OF BASEBALL 
FOR EXAMPLE JUDGE WHO IN A SENSE CAME ON AND GAVE BASEBALL SOME INTEGRITY AFTER THE SCANDAL ALSO IS PORTRAYED HERE AS AS A MAN WITH CLAY FEET 
TARDY ON CIVIL RIGHTS BEYOND BELIEF 
IT IS HIS DEATH THAT ALLOWS IN MANY WAYS ROBINSON TO ADVANCE 
YEAH 
BENJAMIN CHANDLER HAPPY CHANDLER 
RIGHT 
BECOMES THE COMMISSIONER AND HE REALIZES THAT IF YOU CAN DIE AT AND OKINAWA YOU CAN PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
YEAH 
AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND FOR THOSE YEARS DID NOTHING TO HELP 
AND OTHER THAN THE SHEER SENSE OF OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT AND AND AND THE OF IT AND THE MORALITY OF IT AND THE JUSTICE OF IT HOW DID AFRICAN AMERICANS CHANGE THE GAME 
OH IN EVERY WAY 
AND YOU KNOW WE TRADITIONALLY EVEN WHEN WE FEEL SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY IN OUR KIND OF TYPICALLY PATRONIZING ATTITUDE WE ALWAYS IT INTO SOME BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
RIGHT RIGHT 
AND STILL IT STILL IT 
AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS WAS TO INTEGRATE IT FROM THE VERY FIRST INNING ON 
THEY PLAYED A DIFFERENT KIND OF GAME THAT WAS ABOUT SPEED ABOUT 
YEAH 
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT BUNTING ABOUT MESSING UP THE PITCHER 
ROBERT DESCRIBES WATCHING ROBINSON WALK IN THAT FIRST YEAR AND THEN MANUFACTURE A RUN ALL BY HIMSELF BY THE PITCHER BY TAKING LONG LEADS AND THEN BY THE TIME THE PITCHER THROWS BACK WALKING TILL FINALLY THE THIRD BASEMAN IS BEING CALLED OVER TO HOLD ROBINSON ON THIRD 
YEAH 
AND HE SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT 
NEVER SEEN IT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE 
DAVID HALBERSTAM IN HIS BOOK OCTOBER NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
FABULOUS BOOK 
TALKS ABOUT HOW THE SAINT LOUIS CARDINALS REPRESENTED THE NEWNESS OF BASEBALL BECAUSE IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE YOU HAD MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS BOB GIBSON AND AND OTHERS WHO 
RIGHT 
AND KURT FLOOD 
AND KURT FLOOD WHO'D MADE THAT TEAM AND THEN THEY COME IN THAT SERIES AGAINST THE NEW YORK YANKEES WHO REPRESENTED YOU KNOW 
THE OLD 
THE OLD WAY 
THE OLD STORY 
AND ALSO POWER HITTING 
YES 
WITH MANTLE AND VERSUS THE NEW SPEED OF THE CARDINALS WITH WITH LOU BROCK FOR EXAMPLE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
NOW PLAYING FOR THE CARDINALS 
AND THAT WAS A TRANSITION TOO IN BASEBALL 
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STATISTIC I'VE COME ACROSS AND I'M NOT WEDDED TO STATISTICS 
I LOVE THE NUMBERS OF BASEBALL BUT I'M NOT WEDDED TO IT IS THAT IN THE YEARS AFTER ROBINSON'S ARRIVAL BLACKS WON THE M. V. P. IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE NINE OUT OF THE NEXT ELEVEN YEARS 
YEAH 
NOW IF THAT DOES NOT SAY AND THAT'S WHEN THERE'S JUST A TRICKLE EVEN IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE IF THAT DOESN'T SAY WHAT WE WERE WITHHOLDING 
WE CANNOT CALL IT THE NATIONAL PASTIME 
DOES IT HAVE THE SAME APPEAL TODAY TO THOSE YOUNG ATHLETES WHETHER THEY'RE BLACK OR WHITE OR OR HISPANIC OR ASIAN AMERICAN 
HISPANIC 
WE OPEN OUR NINTH INNING WITH THE WHO PLAY IN UPPER MANHATTAN WITH A FURY AND A FEVER THAT WOULD BELIE ALL THE ABOUT 
YEAH 
THE DEATH OF BASEBALL 
IT'S NOT AS POPULAR BUT I THINK BASEBALL'S ALWAYS HAD THESE WAVES 
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WE READ THE BOX SCORES 
WE PLAY BASEBALL AND CATCH EVERY DAY 
WE LOVE TO GO TO GAMES AND AS ONE REPORTER I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE'S NOTHING DIMINISHED IN THE AFFECTION OF FOR BASEBALL IN OUR NAT 
BEFORE WE GO I THIS IS AN INTRODUCTION TO THIS FILM AND WE'RE SHOWING IT AS OUR LAST CLIP BUT IT IS ABOUT WHAT THIS GAME IS ABOUT 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY AERIAL SHOT OF NIGHT BASEBALL 
HERE IT IS 
TED WILLIAMS 
TED PROBABLY FOR THE LAST TIME IN A BOSTON UNIFORM IN THIS BALL PARK 
THERE'S A DRIVE TO DEEP RIGHT CENTER 
THIS MAY BE GONE 
FRED WERE YOU BACK THERE WATCHING 
HOME RUN 
TED WILLIAMS 
WINDS AND FIRES 
LANDS A BASE HIT INTO CENTER FIELD 
AROUND SECOND 
HE WILL SCORE TO TIE TWO TO TWO 
LOW AND O. DELIVERY TO FISK 
HE SWINGS LONG DRIVE LEFT FIELD 
IF IT STAYS THERE IT'S GONE 
HOME RUN 
THE RED SOX WIN AND THE SERIES IS TIED THREE GAMES APIECE 
THE FIRST THING ABOUT IT AND THIS SEEMS SO OBVIOUS THAT MAYBE WE OVERLOOK IT BASEBALL IS A BEAUTIFUL THING 
IT'S MORE BEAUTIFUL IN AN OLD PARK THAT'S AND QUIRKY BUT EVEN AND I HATE TO SAY THIS BECAUSE IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE THEM BUT EVEN IN A DOME WITH ARTIFICIAL TURF IT'S BEAUTIFUL THE WAY THE FIELD FANS OUT THE OF THE SPORT THE PACE AND RHYTHM OF IT THE FACT THAT THAT PACE AND RHYTHM ALLOWS FOR CONVERSATION AND REFLECTION AND OPINION AND COMPARISON 
IT'S A PASTIME SOMETHING YOU DO 
IT'S ENTERTAINMENT SOMETHING YOU WATCH AND IT'S SHARED EXPERIENCE SOMETHING YOU YOU TALK ABOUT AND READ ABOUT 
AND AND THAT'S MARVELOUS 
BUT YOU CAN APPLY THOSE SAME THREE CRITERIA TO OTHER THINGS 
WHAT MAKES BASEBALL SPECIAL IS THAT IT'S THE BEST GAME THAT'S EVER BEEN DEVISED 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU APPRECIATE THE LOVE AND THE BEAUTY AND AND ALL THE OF IT 
BART TO ME WAS A HERO 
YES 
AND SOMEBODY WHO LOVED THE GAME AND COULD ARTICULATE WITH A GREAT ELOQUENCE THE GAME 
WE WERE GOING TO INTERVIEW HIM JUST AFTER HE GOT BACK FROM HIS VACATION AFTER THE ROSE INCIDENT 
RIGHT 
WAS PASSED AND THEN WE LOST HIM 
THEN HE HAD A HEART ATTACK 
THAT'S YOU USED TO TALK ABOUT THE THE FACT THAT IT WAS PLAYED OUTDOORS IN THE SUN AND THE SKY AND THE GREEN AND AND THEN THE OF THE WHOLE THING AND ALL OF THAT 
ONE MORE TIME BECAUSE IF THERE'S BEEN SOME CRITICISM AND I WANT YOU TO RESPOND TO IT IS THIS NOTION THAT THAT IT IS AS WHITMAN SAID A GAME 
IT'S OUR GAME 
THAT'S THE CHIEF FACT IN CONNECTION WITH IT AMERICA'S GAME BA BA BA BA BA 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO READ TOO MUCH INTO THE HISTORY OF BASEBALL THAT IT DOES THAT THAT IT IS NOT THE CIVIL WAR 
OH IT IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT THE 
IT'S A GAME 
IT IS DEFINITELY A GAME BUT GAMES ARE A WONDERFUL AND PARTICULARLY THIS GAME IS SORT OF THE NO DRAMA OF OUR CULTURE IT'S WHERE WE PLAY OUT A LOT OF OUR FANTASIES 
I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE BILL HAVE THE BALL GO BETWEEN HIS LEGS 
YEAH 
AND NOT MINE 
AND I INVEST THINGS WITH IMPORTANCE 
AND ALL I'VE TRIED TO DO IS NOT SO M. 
WAIT WAIT 
YOU DIDN'T MIND OR BILL DIDN'T MIND OR OR 
OH HE 
OR MILLIONS OF RED SOX FANS DIDN'T MIND 
I I DIE WHEN I SEE THIS STILL 
YES 
BUT I'M I PREFER IT TO HAPPEN TO HIM 
RIGHT 
WE CAN INVEST IT 
WE CAN WE GET TOO SILLY ABOUT IT 
BUT WHAT I THINK WE'VE DONE IS SAID IF YOU LOOK AT THIS GAME IT REFLECTS OURSELVES BACK TO OURSELVES 
WE CAN READ WHATEVER WE WANT 
THERE ARE LEVELS TO LOOK AT BASEBALL AND THERE ARE LEVELS TO LOOK AT THIS SERIES 
IT IS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF HOURS OF THE GAME OF BASEBALL 
IF YOU A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN THE EDGES COME MANY OF THESE SOCIAL THEMES OF RACE OF LABOR OF IMMIGRATION OF WOMEN OF CITIES 
IF YOU A LITTLE BIT FARTHER YOU YOU BEGIN TO FEEL THIS TIDAL MOVEMENT OF EMOTIONS THAT REFLECTS SOME OF OUR OUR FEELINGS 
JACQUES THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
RIGHT 
SCHOLAR SAID WHOEVER WANTS TO KNOW THE HEART AND MIND OF AMERICA HAD BETTER LEARN BASEBALL 
I AGREE 
WHAT ABOUT WOMEN IN BASEBALL 
THEY HAVE TRIED TO PLAY AND HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY EXCLUDED AT THE HIGHEST PROFESSIONAL LEVELS FOR A LONG TIME 
ALTA WEISS IN THE FIRST DECADE OF THIS CENTURY PLAYED SEMI PROFESSIONAL BALL AND WAS SO SKILLED AT IT THAT HER FATHER EVENTUALLY BOUGHT HER A BARNSTORMING TEAM OF ALL STARS RENAMED IT THE WEISS ALL STARS AND SHE WAS FABULOUS 
THE ALL AMERICAN GIRLS LEAGUE 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IN OUR LIFETIME WE WILL SEE A WOMAN PLAYING IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES 
SHE'LL BE A PITCHER AND SHE'LL THROW MOSTLY BREAKING BALLS BUT SHE WILL BE IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES AND THEN WE WILL TRULY HAVE A NATIONAL PASTIME 
YEAH 
I ALSO MEAN THIS IN A LARGER WAY TOO 
WHAT ABOUT THE APPEAL OF A THIS FILM OR B. BASEBALL TO WOMEN 
I MADE IT FOR THE WOMAN WHO SAYS BOY I LOVED THE CIVIL WAR FILM BUT BASEBALL 
BASEBALL 
AND I SAID BUT YOU LIKE MILITARY HISTORY AND THEY SAY NO THIS IS ABOUT LIFE LESSONS AND TRAGEDIES AND CLASSIC CONFRONTATIONS AND A SENSE OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE 
THAT'S ALL THIS IS 
IT'S THE CONTINUATION OF THAT STORY 
IT'S THE SEQUEL 
WHO SAID HISTORY HAD TO BE WARS AND GENERALS AND PRESIDENTS 
WE COULD FIND THE SAME STORY OF THE LAST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR IN THE WRITINGS OF WOMEN IN FURNITURE IN ARCHITECTURE 
AND I'M SAYING ONE WAY TO SEE IT IS IN BASEBALL AND WHEN YOU STUDY IT AND YOU DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S SYMPATHETIC I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHARING IT WITH PARTICULARLY THOSE WOMEN WHO SAY BASEBALL 
THAT'S FOR MY SON 
YEAH 
OR MY HUSBAND 
AND THEY COME AWAY CONVERTED 
THEY SAY WOW 
THIS IS A DIFFERENT STORY THAN I UNDERSTOOD 
HOW DID IT CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE ABOUT BASEBALL OR YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF BASEBALL IN TERMS OF INVESTING HOW MANY YEARS IN IN 
FOUR AND A HALF 
FOUR AND A HALF YEARS 
YOU KNOW TRUTHFULLY IT LIBERATED SOMETHING IN ME EMOTIONALLY THAT I HAD KEPT IN CHECK 
I REALIZED THAT I COULD I THAT I FIND A CERTAIN PLEASURE IN THE GAME OF BASEBALL THAT IS INDESCRIBABLE AND THAT I COULD TAKE IT BACK IN AND REINVEST IT 
THAT WAS PART OF SEVENTY FIVE WAS FOR ME REALIZING I DIDN'T HAVE TO FOR WHATEVER POLITICAL REASONS OF OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM AND COUNTERCULTURE I DIDN'T NEED TO GET RID OF THIS GAME THAT HAD GIVEN ME SO MUCH PLEASURE AS A BOY 
AND AND I THINK WHAT I'VE DONE IS IN EACH SUCCESSIVE WAVE AS WE PASS THROUGH THE FILM IS I DEEPENED MY LOVE FOR THE GAME 
TAKE ME ONE MORE TIME YOUR MOTHER HAD CANCER 
MY MOTHER HAD CANCER AND I WAS AWARE OF IT FROM YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD 
AND WHAT 
AND SO YOU WERE YOU YOU HAD THE PAIN OF HER CANCER 
I WAS JUST I WAS A LITTLE BOY UNABLE TO HAVE A CHILDHOOD 
I WAS I WAS SUDDENLY A YOUNG MAN AN ADULT AND I HAD TO BE STRONG AND THERE WERE VERY FEW PLACES WHERE YOU COULD STILL BE A KID 
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS ELEVEN AND EVEN THEN THAT DIDN'T STOP BECAUSE YOU HAD TO CONTINUE BEING STRONG 
AND BASEBALL WAS ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE YOU COULD JUST BE A KID 
DO YOU THINK THAT EXPERIENCE SOMEHOW MADE YOU DO WHAT YOU DO NOW 
ABSOLUTELY 
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS DYING I USED TO LISTEN TO THE THE DOGS AND THE FIRE HOSES IN SELMA AND GET INCREDIBLY ANXIOUS AND SO I BROUGHT IN FROM LEFT FIELD THE CANCER OF RACE THAT WAS WAS KILLING MY COUNTRY AND THEY AND TRIED TO OBSCURE THE CANCER THAT WAS MY FAMILY 
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO CONCERNED NOT JUST WITH WAKING THE DEAD 
MM 
BUT WITH TRYING TO FIND THAT THAT STREAM WHERE OUR PROMISE MIGHT INTERSECT WITH OUR REALITY 
AND I BELIEVE AS A REPUBLIC WE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST REDEMPTION AS A NATION IF WE CAN EVER FIND THE SOLUTION TO THIS QUESTION OF RACE OF WHY PEOPLE THINK THAT BUCK O'NEIL IS NOT THE SAME AS ME 
AND I CONSIDER HIM A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY 
I HAD I'LL TELL YOU I MADE THIS FILM FOR ONE REASON 
I WAS AT THE ALL STAR GAME 
I WAS IN THE CELEBRITY HITTING CONTEST AND IT WAS A CHARITY EVENT AND UPPER DECK WAS DOING GIVING CHARITIES 
AND PEOPLE DID BIG BROTHER BIG SISTER IN THIS HOSPITAL 
MINE WAS THE NEGRO LEAGUE MUSEUM 
AND A REPORTER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID ANOTHER REPORTER HAD SAID TO HIM WHAT'S KEN CHARITY AND HE SAID THE NEGRO LEAGUE AND HE GOES I DIDN'T KNOW KEN BURNS WAS BLACK 
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER I'M BLACK OR WHITE TO BE INTERESTED IN THE NEGRO LEAGUE MUSEUM IS WHEN WE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO AND ALL OF THESE THINGS WHETHER IT'S BASEBALL THE CIVIL WAR HUEY LONG THOMAS JEFFERSON THE CONGRESS 
THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE AS A 
THEY ARE ALL AN ATTEMPT TO SORT OF DESCRIBE EITHER THE NEGATIVE OR THE POSITIVE A POSSIBILITY A POSSIBILITY FOR US 
AND AND SO WHO IS KEN BURNS 
IS HE HE'S A HISTORIAN 
HE'S A FILMMAKER 
HE'S A HE'S WHAT 
WHAT'S HE BUILDING 
WHAT IS THE BODY OF WORK 
WELL I YOU KNOW WHAT I DISCOVERED IN THIS PRODUCT IS THAT I'VE BEEN PAYING LIP SERVICE TO THIS IDEA THAT I'M INTERESTED IN THIS QUESTION WHO ARE WE AS A PEOPLE 
RIGHT 
RIGHT 
WHAT I DISCOVERED IN THIS SORT OF 
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN 
WHO AM I AND JUST GO FARTHER 
THAT'S AN OBVIOUS THING FOR A FILMMAKER TO BE INTERESTED IN BUT IT'S EACH ONE OF THESE THESE PROJECTS REFLECTS SOMETHING BACK ABOUT ME AND THAT I AM INTERESTED IN AN AMERICAN CHARACTER BUT I'M INTERESTED FIRST IN WHY WHAT THE COMPLICATED PAIN OR JOY OF THIS AMERICAN CHARACTER IS AND THESE FILMS HELP NARROW DOWN THE OBSERVATIONS 
SO I AM FIRST AND FOREMOST A FILMMAKER 
I AM AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN COMPLETELY UNTRAINED 
I RELY ON THE EXPERTISE OF DISTINGUISHED HISTORIANS WHO ADVISE US ON EVERY PROJECT 
BUT IT IS THE CHOICE OF HISTORY IS LIKE A PAINTER CHOOSING OILS INSTEAD OF 
I'M FIRST AND FOREMOST A FILMMAKER 
I IT'S A WONDERFUL SERIES BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT AMERICA 
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO EXPERIENCE THINGS ABOUT BASEBALL THAT YOU DON'T KNOW 
I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THE OTHER NIGHT TO GO TO THE HALL OF FAME FOR TENNIS 
I MEAN I'M A TENNIS PLAYER 
AND THERE IN THAT ROOM WERE SOME OF THE LEGENDS OF TENNIS AND IT BROUGHT IT ALIVE TO ME 
YOU GO BACK TO TO DAD AND BRING THEM ALIVE IN THIS FILM ADN BRING ALIVE THE HISTORY OF WHAT THIS SPORT HAS MEANT TO US AND AND WHAT IT MEANS TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHE 
YOU DO IT WITH THE HELP OF PEOPLE FROM STEVEN J. GOULD TO AS WE SAY TO MARIO CUOMO AND BOB COSTAS AND PEOPLE WHO KNEW THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE GAME 
MY CONGRATULATIONS KEN
