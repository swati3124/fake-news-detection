ORGANIC FOOD IS SUPPOSED TO BE HEALTHY BUT SOME NATURAL PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS USED IN GROWING ORGANIC FOODS CAN BE DANGEROUS 
THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF ORGANIC TO ALLOW FARMERS TO USE SOME UNNATURAL MATERIALS TO GROW ORGANIC FOOD 
KATHLEEN KOCH HAS MORE 
POWDERED FLOWERS AS PESTICIDE A TROPICAL TREE EXTRACT TO KILL RODENTS THEY'RE SOME OF THE NATURAL PRODUCTS FARMERS RELY ON TO GROW ORGANIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
BUT THE POWDERED FLOWERS KILL GOOD BUGS TOO AND THE TREE EXTRACT KILLS RACCOONS AND OTHER 
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SAYS THAT'S PROOF THAT NATURAL ISN'T ALWAYS BEST 
THERE'S A LOT OF NATURAL HARMFUL CARCINOGENS IN THE IN NATURE THAT EXIST NO SUCH THING AS A COMPLETELY ZERO TOLERANCE YOU KNOW SAFE FOR ALL THINGS AND ALL TIME 
THE U. S. D. A. IS EXPECTED BY NEXT OCTOBER TO RELEASE ITS DEFINITION OF WHAT QUALIFIES AS ORGANIC AND UNLIKE THE STANDARDS USED IN MOST STATES TODAY IT WON'T REQUIRE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT NATURAL MATERIALS IN EITHER THE PRODUCT OR IN THE FIELD 
WELL IN MANY CASES ORGANIC FARMERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ORGANIC IF YOU CALL IT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ORGANIC 
IN FACT MANY ORGANIC FARMERS USE SYNTHETIC MATERIALS 
HALEY SAYS THOUGH SYNTHETIC MATERIALS ARE SOMETIMES SAFER THAN ORGANIC ONES 
BUT ONE CONSUMER GROUP FEARS THE NEW STANDARDS COULD WATER DOWN THE PURITY PEOPLE NOW EXPECT IN ORGANIC FOODS 
I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE HAS REALLY WANTED TO BE REALLY AS ALL ENCOMPASSING SO THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE SOME PESTICIDES TO BE USED 
WE IN THE CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FEEL THAT IT HAS TO BE STRICTER 
HEALTH FOOD STORES SAY SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WON'T BUY THE PRODUCTS IF THE DEFINITION OF ORGANIC CHANGES 
THEY'LL ONLY BUY ORGANIC 
THEY DON'T WANT ANY CHANCE OF GETTING ANY NON NATURAL SUBSTANCES IN THEIR BODY 
I REALLY THINK THE MORE NATURAL THE BETTER 
BUT OTHERS BELIEVE THAT IF THE NEW U. S. D. A. STANDARDS MAKE ORGANIC FOOD CHEAPER AND MORE THEY'RE WORTH IT 
YES IF THE PRICE WOULD GO DOWN AND THEN EVERYONE WOULD BE HAPPY BECAUSE WE'D ALL BE EATING ORGANICALLY AND HEALTH 
SO WHEN IT COMES TO SYNTHETIC MATERIALS AND ORGANIC FOODS JUST SAY NO COULD CHANGE NEXT YEAR TO YES
