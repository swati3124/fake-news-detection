THE POPULAR NEW SPORT ROLLER BLADING IS SPEEDING FAST INTO A LEGAL MESS 
THE UNANSWERED QUESTION WHEN SKATERS ON THE WHEELS WHERE SHOULD THEY SKATE ON THE SIDEWALK OR IN THE STREET 
C. N. N.'S GARY TUCHMAN TELLS US ABOUT THE PROBLEMS ROLLER BLADING CAUSED ONE WOMAN IN CONNECTICUT 
LAURIE PALMER IS A PROUD MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER WHO HAS GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE FOR SOMETHING SHE'S BEEN DOING IN TRAFFIC 
LAURIE IS AN IN LINE SKATER A SPORT MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS ROLLER BLADING 
AND BECAUSE SIDEWALKS ARE OFTEN NARROW POORLY MAINTAINED OR JUST DON'T EXIST SHE LIKES TO SKATE IN THE STREET 
THE PROBLEM IS THE POLICE IN MANCHESTER CONNECTICUT DON'T LIKE WHAT SHE'S DOING 
THE ROADWAYS ARE DESIGNED AND BUILT FOR THE CARS NOT FOR WALKING 
BUT IS AN IN LINE SKATER A PEDESTRIAN 
OUR INTERPRETATION IS ANY TYPE OF PERSON THAT'S USING A ROADWAY LIKE WITH HIS SKATES ON WE WOULD CONSIDER THEM PEDESTRIANS 
AND CONNECTICUT LAW SAYS PEDESTRIANS AREN'T ALLOWED IN THE STREETS FOR SAFETY REASONS SO LAURIE PALMER WAS RECENTLY ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH CONDUCT 
SHE FACES A COURT DATE THAT COULD LEAD TO JAIL TIME 
I'M GOING TO FIGHT IT AS FAR AS IT NEEDS TO GO TO ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE TO ROLLER BLADE 
IN THE STREET 
IN THE STREET 
THE ISSUE COMES DOWN TO IS SHE OR IS SHE NOT A PEDESTRIAN 
LAURIE PALMER SAYS SHE HAS NO INTENTION OF STAYING OFF THE STREET 
AND WHILE SHE KEEPS ON ROLLING HER LEGAL WHEELS ARE IN MOTION 
SHE HAS ASKED THE INTERNATIONAL IN LINE SKATING ASSOCIATION TO HELP HER OUT 
IN LAURIE'S CASE IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE WAS MORE LIKE A BIKE THAN A PEDESTRIAN SO HER TICKETS WRITTEN FOR PEDESTRIANS ARE CLEARLY NOT APPLICABLE IN THIS CASE 
THE SPORT OF IN LINE SKATING IS BOOMING 
THE FACT THAT IT'S GETTING TO POPULAR MEANS MANY OTHER POLICE FORCES ARE FACING SIMILAR STREET SKATING SITUATIONS 
IN MOST CASES NOTHING IS DONE BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH LAURIE PALMER 
SHE WILL GO BEFORE A JUDGE AND JURY IN TWO WEEKS 
THE FACT IS YOU COULD LITERALLY GO TO JAIL FOR THIS RIGHT 
YES I COULD 
ARE YOU PREPARED TO SERVE JAIL TIME 
IF I HAVE TO 
SHE COULD RECEIVE UP TO THREE MONTHS IN JAIL BUT FOR NOW SHE CONTINUES HER HOBBY WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK THAT HER DESIRE TO GO ON THE STREET AND SKATE COULD BE LINKED TO A FAIRLY UNPLEASANT FATE
