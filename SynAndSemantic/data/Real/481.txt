JAPAN IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO PUBLICLY AIRING THE DIRTY LAUNDRY OF ITS SOCIETAL PROBLEMS BUT ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS AFFECTING YOUNG TEENAGERS IS SUDDENLY IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
PRIME MINISTER IS ORDERING JAPANESE EDUCATION OFFICIALS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SCHOOL YARD BULLYING 
IT'S LONG BEEN A JAPANESE FACT OF LIFE AND NOW APPARENTLY HAS CAUSED TWO TEENAGE SUICIDES 
C. N. N.'S ANDREA KOPPEL REPORTS 
SINCE THE TIME HE WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE HAD LED A TORTURED LIFE 
HE'D BEEN BEATEN HUMILIATED ALMOST DROWNED AND FORCED TO STEAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM HIS FAMILY

THIS YEAR SEVEN SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN LIKE ARE REPORTED TO HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY WERE 
BUT ONLY NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF IS JAPAN'S MINISTER OF EDUCATION REACTING PUBLICLY 
THOSE WHO DID THIS BULLYING SHOULD COME FORWARD TO PARENTS AND TEACHERS 
SCHOOL TEACHERS AND OFFICIALS SHOULD BE TOUGH ON THESE STUDENTS 
NO MATTER HOW YOUNG THEY ARE THERE ARE LAWS TO PUNISH THEM 
I BELIEVE PROPER STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN 
SINCE NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH AUTHORITIES IN THE FARMING COMMUNITY OF CITY WHERE GREW UP HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH PHONE CALLS FROM ANGRY PARENTS ALL OVER JAPAN 
IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL HAS HAD A SPECIAL COMMITTEE IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH BULLYING
