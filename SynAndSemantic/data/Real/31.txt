THIS WEEK WE'VE SHOWN YOU THE BEAUTY AND THE FURY OF VOLCANOES 
BY NOW YOU KNOW THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FORCES NATURE CAN UNLEASH 
BUT NOT ALL VOLCANOES ARE ALIKE AND THEY DON'T FORM ALL IN ONE AREA 
THIS MAP POINTS OUT JUST A HANDFUL OF THE VOLCANOES ON THIS EARTH AND THE ONES ON WHICH WE'RE FOCUSING 
WHEN THEY BLOW THEIR STACK IT CAN BE SPECTACULAR UNDERWATER OR ABOVE SEA LEVEL 
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE DISASTROUS 
TAKE THE MOUNTAIN 
PINATUBO LAST SUMMER WHICH SPEWED ASH HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO THE AIR AND SENT LAVA RACING TOWARD COMMUNITIES AND U. S. MILITARY BASES ON THE ISLAND 
MOST OF THAT PROPERTY IS NOW BURIED UNDERNEATH LAVA 
BUT MANY LIVES WERE SAVED BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN EVACUATED BEFORE THE ERUPTION 
SOME VOLCANOES SUCH AS PINATUBO HAVE A BUILT IN WARNING SYSTEM A SERIES OF SMALL EARTHQUAKES 
OTHER VOLCANOES ERUPT WITHOUT WARNING 
BUT THEY ALL BEGIN THE SAME WAY AS OR MELTED ROCK DEEP INSIDE THE EARTH 
THE RISES TOWARD THE EARTH'S SURFACE IT'S LIGHTER THAN THE SOLID ROCK AROUND IT 
ITS HEAT ACTUALLY A PATH THROUGH SOME OF THE ROCK 
THE EVENTUALLY IN A CHAMBER JUST UNDER THE SURFACE 
AS THE PRESSURE BUILDS THE BLASTS THROUGH THE SURFACE 
THE LAVA AND ASH PILE UP AROUND THIS OPENING OR VENT FORMING THE VOLCANO 
THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE KINDS OF VOLCANOES 
MAUNA IN HAWAII THE LARGEST IS PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF A SHIELD VOLCANO 
THAT'S WHERE LAVA HAS GRADUALLY BUILT UP A LOW DOME SHAPED MOUNTAIN 
CINDER CONES SUCH AS HAWAII'S ARE FORMED MAINLY BY VOLCANIC ROCK 
THE THIRD TYPE OF VOLCANO IS PERHAPS THE MOST 
COMPOSITE VOLCANOES SUCH AS JAPAN'S MOUNTAIN 
FUJI ARE FORMED BY BOTH LAVA AND VOLCANIC ROCK 
SOME VOLCANOES ERUPT CONSTANTLY LIKE OFF THE COAST OF ITALY 
KNOWN AS ACTIVE VOLCANOES THEIR ERUPTIONS ARE USUALLY QUIET 
INTERMITTENT VOLCANOES ERUPT ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS 
MOUNTAIN 
ETNA IN SICILY FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN OOZING LAVA FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW THREATENING SEVERAL TOWNS AT THE BASE OF THE VOLCANO 
THEN THERE ARE THE SLEEPING OR DORMANT VOLCANOES 
OREGON'S MOUNTAIN 
HOOD IS ONE SUCH EXAMPLE OF A VOLCANO THAT'S BEEN BUT STILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ERUPT 
FOR YEARS MOUNT SAINT WAS IN THAT CATEGORY UNTIL AS YOU KNOW IT BLEW TWELVE YEARS AGO 
BOY PREPARES FOR GEOGRAPHY BEE 
WE TRY TO TEACH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BY SHOWING YOU MAPS 
YOUR TEACHERS MAY TRY DIFFERENT METHODS TO YOUR INTEREST BUT MANY OF YOU JUST DON'T TAKE TO GEOGRAPHY 
STILL IT IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT TO LEARN AND WE KNOW OF AT LEAST FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WHO DO LIKE IT 
THEY'RE STUDENTS IN GRADES SIX THROUGH EIGHT GATHERED IN WASHINGTON D. C. FOR THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHY BEE 
C. N. N.'S NEWSROOM'S COURTNEY TAKES A LOOK AT HOW ONE COMPETITOR PREPARED 
WHERE IS THE BAY OF WHOSE LONG HISTORY OF SEA GOING ACTIVITIES DATES BACK TO THE TIME OF THE CIRCA ELEVEN HUNDRED B. C. 
THE ANSWER SPAIN 
AND IF YOU DIDN'T GET IT DON'T WORRY 
GEOGRAPHY IS THIS TEENAGER'S EXPERTISE 
FOR THE LAST MONTH THIRTEEN YEAR OLD NICK HAS LIVED AND BREATHED GEOGRAPHY 
YOU KNOW I LIKE GEOGRAPHY BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T DREAM ABOUT IT 
ALL IN PREPARATION FOR THIS YEAR'S NATIONAL GEOGRAPHY BEE 
WELL I HAVE A U. S. ATLAS HERE ROAD ATLAS A EUROPEAN ATLAS AND THEN I HAVE AN HISTORICAL ATLAS AND A WORLD ATLAS OVER THERE 
YOU COULD CALL IT MAP MANIA 
THEY'RE IN BOOKS ON THE WALL EVEN IN STACKS AWAY IN THE CLOSET 
HAVE YOU READ ALL THIS STUFF FRONT TO BACK 
WELL I'VE ATTEMPTED TO BUT I'VE BUT NOW I'M JUST SORT OF OPENING A PAGE AND READING SOMETHING 
A LOT OF TIMES I GET I OPEN UP I READ THE SAME THING A LOT 
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I'VE OPENED UP TO EVERY PAGE BUT I'VE NOT READ IT 
WHEN IT COMES TO WORLD GEOGRAPHY NICK KNOWS MORE THAN THE AVERAGE EIGHTH GRADER OR ADULT FOR THAT MATTER 
HIS LOVE FOR IT COMES NATURALLY AND HE ISN'T SURE WHEN THIS ALL STARTED 
WELL THAT'S ONE THING I REALLY DON'T KNOW 
I SORT OF I'VE ALWAYS LIKED MAPS 
BUT YOU KNOW I JUST GOT INVOLVED FROM LOOKING IN A COUPLE OF MAPS TO THIS 
SO 
NICK STUDIES MORNING NOON AND NIGHT 
BUT HE STILL FINDS TIME TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN 
YOU JUST HAVE TO PUSH YOURSELF A LITTLE HARDER TO LEARN GEOGRAPHY YOU KNOW 
YOU HAVE TO READ EVERY BOOK THAT YOU SEE THAT HAS TO DO WITH GEOGRAPHY 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MAGAZINES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT NORMALLY A KID WOULD BE PLAYING NINTENDO 
NICK HOPES TO BEAT OUT FIFTY SIX OTHER COMPETITORS TAKING PART IN THE BEE AND WIN A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP 
IT'S FUN BUT SORT OF LIKE COMPETITION IS PRETTY FUN BUT YOU KNOW NERVOUS NERVE RACKING 
SO IF IT'S USUALLY LIKE THAT MOST OF THE QUESTIONS I KNOW BUT IF THERE'S ONE I DON'T KNOW I JUST PRAY THAT I DON'T GET IT 
PRAYER THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD THE COMBINATION NICK IS COUNTING ON TO CARRY HIM INTO THE WINNER'S CIRCLE 
COURTNEY C. N. N. NEWSROOM POTOMAC MARYLAND

WE SURE WILL 
AND TOMORROW WE'LL YOU WHO WON THE CONTEST
