WHEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION SIGNED AN AUTONOMY AGREEMENT LAST MONTH THE WORLD WONDERED ALOUD IF THESE TWO CENTURIES OLD MORTAL ENEMIES COULD COME TO TERMS FOR PEACE WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER LONG STANDING DISPUTES AROUND THE WORLD COULD THESE TOO BE SETTLED IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE CONFLICT IS REFERRED TO SIMPLY AS THE TROUBLES 
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC MINORITY AND THE PROTESTANT MAJORITY GO BACK CENTURIES 
AFTER HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN POLITICAL ACCOMMODATIONS FIGHTING ERUPTED BETWEEN PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND IN THE QUARTER CENTURY SINCE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
IN FACT IT'S BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS THE WORST ONGOING CONFLICT IN ANY WESTERN DEMOCRACY SINCE WORLD WAR TWO 
THEN LATE LAST MONTH JOHN HUME A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FROM NORTHERN IRELAND AND GERRY ADAMS PRESIDENT OF SINN FEIN THE POLITICAL WING OF THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY TWO OF NORTHERN IRELAND'S MOST INFLUENTIAL CATHOLIC LEADERS WHO HAPPEN TO BE ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM HAD COME TO AN AGREEMENT FOR THE GROUNDWORK FOR A PEACE PROCESS 
MARK REPORTS FOR THE IRISH TIMES OF DUBLIN 
TWO AND ONE HALF YEARS REPORTING IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND HE JOINS US NOW 
GOOD MORNING 
HELLO THERE 
CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS THAT JOHN HUME AND GERRY ADAMS HAVE AGREED TO 
WELL NOBODY IS QUITE SURE YET 
THEY HAD TALKS IN SECRET FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE ANYBODY FOUND OUT THEY WERE TALKING 
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE INDEED THE ISRAELI P. L. O. TALKS WHERE NOBODY KNEW THEY WERE GOING ON UNTIL THEY WERE AT AN ADVANCED STAGE 
BUT THEY HAVE AGREED SOME KIND OF A JOINT STATEMENT A JOINT NATIONALIST STATEMENT IF YOU LIKE WHICH THEY ARE NOW BRINGING TO THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND BRINGING TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND SEEKING THEIR APPROVAL 
BUT REALLY THE DETAILS OF IT AREN'T KNOWN YET BUT THE AIM OF IT IS FOR JOHN HUME WHO REPRESENTS IF YOU LIKE THE MAJORITY VIEW WITHIN CATHOLIC NATIONALIST OPINION TO PERSUADE THE MINORITY VIEW WHICH SUPPORTS THE I. R. A. THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE POLITICAL WAY FORWARD SO I PRESUME IT'S SOME KIND OF STATEMENT SAYING THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME NATIONALIST OPINION IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS UNITED BEHIND A POLITICAL PROGRAM AND THERE IS NO NEED TO EXPRESS THAT POLITICAL OPINION VIOLENTLY ANY MORE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND 
I MEAN THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG AND SINN FEIN HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN A PART OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO RENOUNCE VIOLENCE 
HOW IS IT THAT THESE TWO COULD FIND SOME COMMON GROUND 
I THINK THE ROOT OF IT MAY BE A REALIZATION WITHIN SINN FEIN THAT THE VIOLENT CAMPAIGN ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE 
YOU KNOW I. R. A. VIOLENCE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AS YOU SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED DURING THAT TIME 
AND YET THEY ARE NO NEARER TODAY TO THEIR STATED AIM OF A UNITED IRELAND THAN THEY WERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
SO SINN FEIN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING HAVE BEEN HINTING AT THIS KIND OF THING IN PUBLIC THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MODIFYING THEIR AIMS SAYING MAYBE WE DON'T WANT A UNITED IRELAND 
MAYBE WE'LL AGREE TO HAVE SOME PHASED WITHDRAWAL 
MAYBE WE WOULD AGREE IF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SAID WELL IN THIRTY YEARS TIME WE MIGHT WANT A UNITED IRELAND 
' SO BASICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS WITHIN SINN FEIN THAT THEY'RE FLEXIBLE THAT THEY MAY BE LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT OF VIOLENCE 
AND I THINK IT IS THAT CHANGED MOOD WHICH HAS LEAD TO THE OPTIMISM FOR THESE PRESENT TALKS 
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S SECRETARY FOR THE NORTH SIR PATRICK SAID LAST WEEK THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE I. R. A. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
ONE SHOULD ASSUME PERHAPS THAT ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS WOULD BE THE OF VIOLENCE 
YES IT'S INTERESTING THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS IN FACT CHANGED THE TONE OF WHAT IT SAYS RATHER THAN WHAT IT ACTUALLY SAYS 
FOR MOST OF THE TIME OF THE TROUBLES THEY HAVE SAID WE WON'T TALK TO THE I. R. A. OR SINN FEIN BECAUSE THEY'RE INVOLVED IN VIOLENT ACTS 
NOW THEY'RE SIMPLY SAYING THE LOGICAL COROLLARY OF THAT IS THAT IS OF COURSE IF THEY STOP SUPPORTING AND BEING INVOLVED IN THOSE VIOLENT ACTS WE WOULD TALK TO THEM 
SO BY SINN FEIN PRESIDENT GERRY ADAMS SAYING THAT HE'S THINKING OF THE I. R. A. FROM LONG HELD ARTICLES OF FAITH HE COULD BE RESPONDING TO WHAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS SAYING 
YES I THINK THE LONG HELD ARTICLES OF FAITH HE WANTS TO REDIRECT THEM AWAY FROM ARE MORE THE SIMPLISTIC BELIEF THAT WE CAN HAVE A UNITED IRELAND TOMORROW OR NEXT YEAR 
YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'VE REALIZED THAT THINGS AREN'T AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
THERE IS A PROTESTANT UNION IN THIS COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT HAS TO BE PERSUADED OF THE OF THIS 
THEY CERTAINLY WON'T BE PERSUADED BY A CONTINUATION OF I. R. A. VIOLENCE 
SO I THINK YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE GERRY ADAMS ARE GETTING MORE SOPHISTICATED IN THEIR POLITICAL OUTLOOK 
THEY'RE SAYING WE'LL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SOMETHING LESS PERHAPS THAN A UNITED IRELAND 
WE CAN SETTLE FOR SOME FORM OF JOINT AUTHORITY OVER NORTHERN IRELAND FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN YOU KNOW WITH THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS JOINTLY RUNNING NORTHERN IRELAND 
OR SETTLE FOR SOME OTHER INGENIOUS STRUCTURE WHICH NOBODY HAS ACTUALLY ARTICULATED YET 
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'RE BASICALLY RE EXAMINING THE SIMPLISTIC VIEW THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A UNITED IRELAND OR NOTHING 
WHAT ABOUT IAN PAISLEY WHO LEADS THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONISTS 
HE BASICALLY WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING THAT GERRY ADAMS OR SINN FEIN WOULD HAVE TO PROPOSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS 
HOW DO YOU CONVINCE SOMEONE LIKE HIM TO GET INVOLVED IN THE TALKS SINCE NOW HE SAYS IT DOESN'T MATTER HE'S NOT GOING TO TALK WITH GERRY ADAMS 
I DON'T THINK SOMEONE LIKE HIM CAN BE CONVINCED 
I MEAN DOCTOR PAISLEY REPRESENTS I THINK THE MOST STRIDENT AND MOST WELL KNOWN VOICE OF OUTSIDE IRELAND 
BUT HE STILL REPRESENTS VERY MUCH A MINORITY 
I MEAN TWO THIRDS OF UNIONISTS VOTE FOR THE OFFICIAL UNIONIST PARTY WHICH IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS MORE MODERATE AND REASONABLE THAN IAN PARTY WHICH IS CALLED THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY 
SO HE'S VERY STRIDENT AND VERY VOCAL 
HE SAYS HE'LL NEVER TALK TO SINN FEIN 
BUT HE STILL REPRESENTS ONLY A MINORITY WITHIN UNIONIST OPINIONS 
IS IT JUST THE DEATH TOLL THAT SEEMS TO BE PERSUADING PEOPLE NOW TO START TALKING OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON 
I MEAN THIS PEACE HAS REALLY BEEN ELUSIVE IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME 
WHY NOW 
I THINK IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE DEATH TOLL 
I MEAN THREE THOUSAND DEATHS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT WHICH OF COURSE IT IS BUT OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH MAYBE EIGHTY OR NINETY BEING KILLED IN ANY ONE YEAR PEOPLE GET USED TO IT 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND NOT COME ACROSS ANY MANIFESTATION OF THE VIOLENCE OR THE TROUBLES AT ALL 
SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE DEATH TOLL AS THE EFFECT ON SOCIETY 
YOU'VE HAD SORT OF A STAGNANT AND DIVIDED SOCIETY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
I THINK IT'S MORE THE REALIZATION ON BOTH SIDES THAT HOLDING ON TO OLD LONG HELD ARTICLES OF FAITH WITHOUT ANY FLEXIBILITY AREN'T GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE 
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PESSIMISM 
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEEN POLITICAL INITIATIVES COME AND GO IN THE PAST 
THIS ONE HAS RAISED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOPE BUT WE COULD WELL BE TALKING IN TWO MONTHS TIME ABOUT ANOTHER POLITICAL INITIATIVE WHICH HAD FAILED YOU KNOW 
THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO YET 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO THIS PARTICULAR INITIATIVE 
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER THE TWO MAIN NATIONALIST PARTIES THOSE REPRESENTED BY JOHN HUME ON THE ONE HAND AND GERRY ADAMS ON THE OTHER CAN COME UP WITH ANY PROPOSAL WHICH HAS ANY CHANCE OF BEING ACCEPTABLE TO UNIONISTS 
I MEAN BECAUSE THAT'S THE QUESTION YOU WERE ASKING EARLIER ABOUT IAN PAISLEY 
IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE ANY NATIONALIST AGENDA EVEN IF IT STOPS SHORT OF A UNITED IRELAND WHICH COULD FIND ACCEPTANCE WITH ANY BODY OF UNIONIST OPINION 
I THINK THAT IS THE MAIN OBSTACLE IN THE LONG TERM 
MARK REPORTS FOR THE IRISH TIMES OF DUBLIN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
O. K.
