HERE NOW TO DISCUSS THE SHOOTDOWN AND OTHER ISSUES INVOLVING BOSNIA WE'RE JOINED BY ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER 
DOCTOR BRZEZINSKI IS NOW A COUNSELOR TO THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES 
DOCTOR BRZEZINSKI THANKS FOR JOINING US 
NICE TO BE WITH YOU 
TWO HISTORIC FIRSTS TODAY ONE IS THE FIRST OFFENSIVE ACTION EVER BY THE NATO ALLIANCE AND SECONDLY THE FIRST OFFENSIVE ACTION IN BOSNIA 
TWO CONTEXTS TWO FIRSTS 
YOUR THOUGHTS 
I THINK THEY ARE BOTH DESIRABLE 
THEY WERE NEEDED 
AFTER ALL NATO'S CREDIBILITY IS AT STAKE 
NATO ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM 
THE SERBS WERE BEING FORCED TO OBEY IT BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE THE RUSSIANS STEPPED IN AND GAVE THE FIG LEAF THEREBY THE IMPACT OF THE NATO ULTIMATUM 
THIS ACTION WHILE IN HUMAN TERMS THE CREDIBILITY OF NATO 
IT DEMONSTRATES TO THE SERBS THAT NATO MEANS BUSINESS AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
IT THE CREDIBILITY ARE YOU SPEAKING NOW WITHIN BOSNIA OR BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST OFFENSIVE ACTION THAT NATO HAS TAKEN IT CREDIBILITY OR ESTABLISHES CREDIBILITY IN AN EVEN BROADER CONTEXT 
NO I WOULDN'T GO QUITE AS FAR AS THAT 
BUT I THINK IT ITS CREDIBILITY IN THE BOSNIAN CONTEXT AND THAT IS IMPORTANT 
IT IS ALSO I THINK SIGNIFICANT THAT NATO IS WILLING TO DO THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT RUSSIA HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO DEFLECT NATO FROM ITS TOUGH AND DETERMINED COURSE 
I WANT TO COME BACK TO SOME MORE ON RUSSIA IN JUST A MOMENT 
BUT INVOLVING TODAY'S ACTION VICE PRESIDENT GORE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND HARIS THE BOSNIAN PRIME MINISTER BOTH SAID ESSENTIALLY THAT THIS CAN ENHANCE PEACE PROSPECTS 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
IN THE LONG RUN YES 
I THINK IN SHORT RUN THERE WILL BE SOME SERB REACTIONS PROBABLY SOME INTENSIFIED SHELLING SOME ATTEMPT TO ASSERT SERBIAN DETERMINATION 
RETALIATION AGAINST U. N. OR OTHER FORCES 
THEY MAY BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PRECIPITATE A TOUGHER NATO INVOLVEMENT A TOUGHER NATO RESPONSE 
BUT SOME OF THEIR MILITARY ACTIVITIES IS I THINK LIKELY GIVEN THEIR STATE OF MIND 
HOW ABOUT THE PLAY IN BELGRADE FROM MR. MILOSEVIC THE PRESIDENT THERE 
HE'S VERY SHREWD AND I THINK HE KNOWS THAT IT'S NOT IN HIS INTEREST THAT THE NATO INVOLVEMENT BE ESCALATED 
NOW TO RUSSIA A VERY CURIOUS THING IN REGARD TO TODAY'S SHOOTING INCIDENT FROM A YELTSIN ADVISER SOME VERY STRONG HARSH CRITICAL COMMENTS AND HE SAYS AND I QUOTE THEY PRESUMABLY MEANING THE WEST SHOULD GET USED TO GETTING MIXED SIGNALS FROM MOSCOW 
SPEAKING OF MIXED SIGNALS AT THE EXACT SAME TIME ESSENTIALLY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY UNDER ANDREI KOZYREV IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING WELL THERE WERE VIOLATIONS AND NATO ENFORCED THE NO FLY ZONE 
WELL MIXED SIGNALS ARE NOW A NORM IN SO FAR AS MOSCOW'S CONCERNED BECAUSE THE SITUATION IN MOSCOW IS VERY MIXED UP 
WE'RE DEALING WITH A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS REALLY NOT IN CHARGE EITHER OF ITS DOMESTIC POLICY NOR OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY 
WE'RE DEALING WITH A GOVERNMENT WHICH I PERSONALLY THINK IS ON THE BRINK OF SOME COLLAPSE OR EXPLOSION 
THEY ARE IN THAT GOVERNMENT WITH ITS TROOPS ARE IN BOSNIA 
YES ON A LIMITED SCALE 
BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS NOT WHAT RUSSIA'S DOING IN BOSNIA BUT THAT IS OF THE INCREASING ASSERTIVENESS OF RUSSIA IN EAST CENTRAL EUROPE 
THE REAL DILEMMA IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IS RUSSIA AND HOW WE RESPOND TO THAT 
YOU HAVE AN EXTENSIVE ARTICLE THAT APPEARS IN THIS QUARTER'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS REVIEW IN WHICH AND IT'S A COPY HERE IN WHICH YOU IT THE PREMATURE PARTNERSHIP 
YOU SPEAK THAT IT IS BUILT AROUND IDEALISTIC THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE WEST AND RUSSIA 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
YES IT'S BUILT AROUND AN OPTIMISM WHICH IS VERY IDEALISTIC AND THEREFORE APPEALING BUT WHICH IN MY JUDGMENT IS NOT FOUNDED ON REALITY 
IT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN RUSSIA AND HAS THE NOTION AT THIS STAGE THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA IS IN THE POSITION TO PURSUE AN EFFECTIVE POLICY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES 
IS RUSSIA GOING BACK TO THE OLD SOVIET WAYS IN SOME FASHION 
NO I FEAR RUSSIA IS ON THE BRINK OF A VERY MAJOR INTERNAL CRISIS AND ONE WHICH IS GOING TO PRECIPITATE REAL PROBLEMS IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA 
AND THIS IS WHY IN THIS ARTICLE ONE ADVOCATE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY A WESTERN STRATEGY WHICH ADDRESSES THE REALITIES OF THE RUSSIAN CONDITION AND PURSUES A POLICY WHICH I CALL A GEOPOLITICAL PLURALISM OF CREATING STABLE CONDITIONS ON THE OF RUSSIA 
MEANING IN UKRAINE 
IN UKRAINE KAZAKHSTAN UZBEKISTAN AND ALSO IN CENTRAL EUROPE AS A MEANS OF CONSOLIDATING OVER TIME THE VERY FLUID AND DANGEROUS SITUATION IN RUSSIA 
O. K. ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI THANKS VERY MUCH 
LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU SOME MORE ABOUT THIS
