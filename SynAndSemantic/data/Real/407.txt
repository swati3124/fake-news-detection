WE WANT TO GO LIVE TO NEW YORK CITY NOW WHERE BASEBALL OWNERS ARE HOLDING A CONFERENCE A NEWS CONFERENCE THAT IS AFTER MEETING IN NEGOTIATIONS EARLIER TODAY 
RICHARD RAVITCH IS SPEAKING 
HE'S THE OWNERS' NEGOTIATOR 
LET'S LISTEN IN 
LIST OF PROPOSALS WHICH THEY DID NOT DISCUSS 
THEY HAVE IT TO US IN WRITING 
WE WILL STUDY IT AND RESPOND TO IT VERY SOON 
WE'RE GOING TO MEET TOMORROW 
NUMBER TWO WE DISCUSSED AGAIN THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE BACK AND FORTH ON THE MERITS AND ARGUABLE OF A SALARY CAP AND HOW IT WOULD AFFECT BASEBALL AND HOW IT'S EFFECTED OTHER SPORTS 
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY PROBABLY THAT THE LION'S SHARE OF THE DISCUSSION HAD TO DO WITH THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE PENSION FUND 
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND JUST EXPLAIN THAT AS BEST I CAN 
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PLAYERS THAT WAS SIGNED DURING THE NINETEEN NINETY NEGOTIATIONS 
IT WAS A FOUR YEAR AGREEMENT AND IT SAID VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE OWNERS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND IN EACH OF THE NEXT FOUR YEARS 
AND IT SAID ON ITS FACE THAT THE OWNERS WERE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTION TO THAT BEYOND THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT 
NOW THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BURDENS AND BENEFITS FROM COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND THIS ISSUE THE ISSUES OF THAT WE'RE DEBATING RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO NEGOTIATE A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT 
IF THE PLAYERS HAD INTENDED HAD WANTED TO GEAR THE PAYMENT OF THE PENSION FUND TO THE ALL STAR GAME AS THEY HAVE SUGGESTED THEY ARE SOMEHOW BY SOME MYSTERIOUS PROCESS ENTITLED TO THEN THE AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE SAID THAT 
BUT IT DIDN'T SAY THAT 
THEY DIDN'T BARGAIN FOR IT AND THEY AREN'T LEGALLY ENTITLED TO IT 
WE HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THEM THAT WE ARE GOING TO EXPECT WHEN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUE IS RESOLVED OBVIOUSLY WE WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL 
LET ME SAY VERY SIMPLY THAT WHEN THE OWNERS ANNOUNCED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THAT THEY WOULD NOT LOCK OUT THEY ASSUMED A TERRIFIC RISK THAT THE PLAYERS COULD STRIKE ON ANY DAY AND CAUSE A MASSIVE DISRUPTION OF THE GAME 
IT WAS A RISK THAT WE TOOK 
NONE THE LESS WE COMMITTED NOT TO LOCK OUT 
WE FURTHER COMMITTED AND CONFIRMED IN WRITING THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW THE EXPIRED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND HONOR IT AND NOT ATTEMPT TO CHANGE IT 
THIS WAS A COMMITMENT MADE LAST JANUARY I BELIEVE AND THROUGH OPENING DAY 
AND ANYBODY WHO WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT THAT COMMITMENT WAS A COMMITMENT TO PAY PENSION FUND OBLIGATIONS COULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT LETTER 
THERE WAS NO COMMITMENT TO MEET ANY OBLIGATIONS ON ANY EXPIRED AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER 
THE ISSUE HERE REMAINS ONE SINGLE ISSUE AND THAT IS THAT THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THIS GAME IS BEING PLAYED AND THE ECONOMIC FORCES THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON BASEBALL REQUIRE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GAME A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM 
AND THE PROPOSAL WE MADE WILL IN MY JUDGMENT GIVE THE PLAYERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN MORE AND MORE MONEY IN THE YEARS AHEAD AND THE GUARANTEE THAT WE GAVE THEM ASSURES THEM THAT THEY WILL NOT MAKE LESS THAN THEY MADE THIS YEAR 
I'D BE DELIGHTED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS 
YES DO THESE TALKS HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY YET 
OH I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM IS VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF GOING OUT ON STRIKE CONSEQUENCES TO THE GAME CONSEQUENCES TO THE OWNERS AND CONSEQUENCES TO THE PLAYERS 
IS THE FRIDAY MISS OR THE AUGUST FIRST MISSED PAYMENT OR NON PAYMENT ADD ANOTHER WEDGE INTO THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND ARE THEY TAKING 
WELL I THINK IF THE UNION WISHES TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS AN ACT OF BAD FAITH BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW THE SIMPLE FACT IS IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT EMPLOYERS TAKE GREAT RISKS WHEN THEY ENTER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND SO DO EMPLOYEES THROUGH THEIR UNIONS 
AND WHEN STRIKES OCCUR THE EMPLOYER IS DEPRIVED OF THE REVENUES OF THE GAME AND THE EMPLOYEES OF THE EMPLOYER ARE DEPRIVED OF THE BENEFITS THAT WERE ACCORDED THEM WHEN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WERE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT 
AND IF THERE IS NOT RESOLUTION OF THIS AND I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT I THINK THERE WON'T BE I HAVE STILL EVERY EXPECTATION AND CERTAINLY EVERY HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE RESOLVED IN A VERY TIMELY FASHION THAT THIS ISSUE WILL GET RESOLVED EASILY AND THAT NOBODY WILL END UP BEING INJURED AS A RESULT OF IT 
BUT THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED IN STRIKING THERE CERTAINLY ARE TO BOTH SIDES 
DID YOU SAY YOU'RE MEETING TOMORROW WITH THE PLAYERS CORRECT 
NO I THINK TOMORROW THE MEETING IS GOING TO BE JUST WITH UNION OFFICIALS AND OURSELVES TO DISCUSS A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES 
IS THIS A HURDLE THAT IS BEFORE YOU GET TO THE SALARY CAP OR IS THIS TAKING UP A GREAT DID THIS TAKE UP A GREAT DEAL OF YOUR TIME TODAY 
WELL IT WAS DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY TODAY 
I DON'T THINK IT IS AN INSURMOUNTABLE OBJECTIVE 
THE PARTIES STILL HAVE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT AN OVER ALL AGREEMENT 
ONE OF THE THINGS TO BE RESOLVED IS THE PENSION SYSTEM AND THE PAYMENTS TO IT AND HOW THEY COME WHETHER IT'S IN OUR PROPOSAL THAT WAS PART OF THE GROSS COMPENSATION TO BE PAID AND WOULD BE DETERMINED ACCORDINGLY OR IN VIEW AS OTHERWISE 
WHEN WAS THE DATE THAT THIS WAS PAID LAST YEAR 
I BELIEVE IT WAS PAID ON AUGUST FIRST LAST YEAR JERRY THAT'S WHAT THE CONTRACT CALLED FOR 
SO THIS AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE 
IT'S NOT A DEADLINE IT WAS A CONTRACT THAT REQUIRED A PAYMENT ON AUGUST FIRST 
THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT 
THE CONTRACT THAT EXPIRED THIS LAST APRIL THAT'S CORRECT 
IT EXPIRED THIS LAST APRIL 
BAD FAITH A TERM THAT'S BEING BANDIED ABOUT NOW IS GIVE AND TAKE NORMAL NEGOTIATIONS 
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME 
I'M UNAWARE OF ANY SITUATION IN WHICH AN EMPLOYER MAKES A PAYMENT WHEN HE'S NOT OBLIGATED TO DO SO DURING THE COURSE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 
MR. RAVITCH WE HAVE HEARD YOU AND MR. AND OTHERS SAY THAT THERE ARE NINETEEN CLUBS LOSING MONEY 
COULD YOU TELL US WOULD YOU LIST THE NINETEEN CLUBS 
NOBODY'S SAID THAT FREQUENTLY 
I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT THE PROJECTIONS THE INDIVIDUAL CLUB PROJECTIONS THAT WERE GIVEN THE UNION REFLECTED THAT FACT 
BUT THE BURDEN OF THE ARGUMENT HERE IS NOT THE POVERTY ARGUMENT 
THE ISSUE IS OUR RIGHT TO BARGAIN FOR OUR TOTAL COST OF LABOR 
AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVE YOUR POVERTY TO HAVE A RIGHT TO BARGAIN 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE ARE NINETEEN CLUBS PROJECTED TO LOSE MONEY OR NINETEEN CLUBS LOSING MONEY 
THERE ARE NINETEEN CLUBS THAT PROVIDED PROJECTIONS TO US WHICH WE SHARED WITH THE UNION WITH THE UNION THAT SHOWED THAT BY THE END OF THIS SEASON THAT THEY WOULD LOSE MONEY 
AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR BECAUSE THE UNION CORRECTLY MADE ONE POINT TODAY AND THAT IS THAT IN THOSE PROJECTIONS THERE WAS NO PROJECTION OF THE WORLD SERIES AND GATE RECEIPT MONEY AND THERE WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE INDIVIDUAL CLUB PROJECTIONS AND NO CLUB PROJECTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AN ASSUMED REVENUE FROM THE WORLD SERIES 'CAUSE NO CLUB KNOWS WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA BE IN IT OR NOT 
WOULD YOU BE UNWILLING TO TELL US THE NINETEEN CLUBS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO LOSE MONEY 
COULD YOU TELL US 
NO BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CLUB FINANCIAL DATA IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE OWNERS FEEL THEY HAVE ANY TO SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC 
THEY FEEL THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO SHARE IT WITH THE PLAYERS AND THEY HAVE DONE SO 
CAN YOU TURN IT AROUND AND GIVE US THE NINE CLUBS THAT ARE MAKING MONEY 
JERRY I WONDER WHEN I MEET THE GUY WHO CAN BUT NOT ADD 
IN THE EVENT THE POST SEASON IS PLAYED WHAT WOULD THAT NUMBER OF CLUBS LOSING MONEY BECOME 
PARDON ME 
IN THE EVENT THAT CLUBS RECEIVE FROM THE CENTRAL FUND THE PROJECTED GATE RECEIPTS AND TELEVISION RECEIPTS FROM THE POST SEASON WHAT WOULD THAT NINETEEN FIGURE CHANGE TO 
RON LET ME ANSWER IT THIS WAY 
THE PROJECTIONS INCLUDED AND ASSUMED AN AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM THE BROADCAST NETWORKS 
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS EXCLUDED WAS THE GATE THEIR SHARE OF THE GATE RECEIPTS AND ROB CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I THINK ROB ARE YOU STILL HERE 
NUMBER 
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TWELVE DOLLARS GATE RECEIPTS WHICH WOULD GO TO THE WINNING OR THE CLUBS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE DIVISIONAL PLAYOFFS THE AND THE WORLD SERIES 
SO IT'S NOT ASCRIBED TO ANY PARTICULAR CLUB RUN 
IT'S NOT IN THOSE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTIONS 
SO WHAT IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON THE CLUBS DEPENDS ON WHO THE WINNERS WERE 
GIVEN THAT THE CLUBS MANY TIMES IN NINETY EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY ONE EIGHTY GOING BACK FORTH PREDICTED FINANCIAL DOOM AND GLOOM AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE CASE WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE IT THIS TIME 
RON I HAVE TO SAY AGAIN THAT THE ECONOMICS OF BASEBALL ARE AS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE UNION AS THEY ARE BY THE OWNERS 
WE CERTAINLY DISAGREE AS TO WHAT THE FUTURE'S GOING TO BE LIKE AND HOW IT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY PLAYER COMPENSATION SYSTEMS 
BUT THE BASIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL THE BASIS OF THE OWNERS' POSITION IS VERY SIMPLE 
WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A GROWING NUMBER OF CLUBS THAT CANNOT AFFORD TO FIELD COMPETITIVE PAYROLLS AND WE THINK THE SYSTEM HAS TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO INSURE A DEGREE OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE GAME 
AND TWO WE HAVE A RIGHT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BARGAIN FOR OUR COST OF LABOR 
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVE YOUR POVERTY IN ORDER TO HAVE A RIGHT TO DO IT 
DO YOU SENSE THAT THERE'S A GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT OUT THERE AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR THE SALARY CAP 
MAYBE A FEELING THAT THE PLAYERS MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY 
I THINK IN ALL CANDOR THERE'S A GROUNDSWELL OF OPINION THAT SAYS THAT THEY'RE REALLY VERY UNHAPPY THAT ONE GROUP OF MILLIONAIRES IS FIGHTING ANOTHER GROUP OF MILLIONAIRES AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE GAME OF BASEBALL 
GIVEN THAT THE PENSION THE FUNDING FOR THE PENSION FUND IS LINKED TO THE ALL STAR GAME WHY 
IT IS NOT LINKED TO THE ALL STAR GAME CLAIRE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE AGREEMENT THAT CREATES THAT LINKAGE WHATSOEVER 
BUT THERE IS A TRADITION 
I THOUGHT IT WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE PENSION 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT MURRAY THE THAT THERE THE TIMING OF THESE PAYMENTS WAS GEARED TO THESE PAYMENTS ARE MADE BY BASEBALL'S CENTRAL FUND AND THAT THE TIMING OF THESE PAYMENTS ARE GEARED TO
