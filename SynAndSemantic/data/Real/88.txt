WHILE THINGS SEEM VERY CALM AND DELIBERATE HERE IN THE HALL THEY WERE JUST ANYTHING BUT IN THE SPIN ROOM BACKSTAGE WHERE GENE RANDALL IS STANDING BY 
GENE 
CATHERINE THERE IS SO MUCH SPINNING GOING ON IN THIS ROOM THE ONLY THING MISSING IS TOTO THE DOG FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ 
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING 
FROM MARLIN FITZWATER PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPOKESMAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE SAID BILL CLINTON WAS THE WHOLE TIME 
HE SAID CLINTON'S LEAD HAS OBVIOUSLY GONE TO HIS HEAD 
FRED MALEK THE CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN FOR THE BUSH REELECTION TEAM 
I THINK PRESIDENT BUSH CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE 
MALEK SAYS THE CRITICAL QUESTION IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED WHICH CANDIDATE THEY TRUST THEY WILL COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF GEORGE BUSH 
RICH BOND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE 
BILL CLINTON WAS A POOR THIRD SAID BOND BECAUSE HE WAS VERY WEAK AND VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN HE WASN'T BEING SMUG AND ARROGANT 
ON THE CLINTON SIDE JAMES CARVILLE CLINTON'S TOP STRATEGIST HE SAID THERE IS A LONG TIME TO GO IN THE RACE AND WE'LL STILL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON 
BUT HE SAID ON CLINTON'S PERFORMANCE I THINK HE CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DISPUTES THAT 
FROM RON BROWN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE 
GEORGE BUSH NEEDED TO HIT A HOME RUN TONIGHT 
HE STRUCK OUT AGAIN 
BILL CLINTON ONCE AGAIN SOUNDED PRESIDENTIAL LOOKED PRESIDENTIAL ACTED PRESIDENTIAL 
HE IS READY TO BECOME PRESIDENT 
AND FINALLY ON THE PEROT SIDE 
ORSON SWINDLE SAID PEROT WON IT HANDS DOWN 
HE SAID IT WAS A HELL OF A GOOD NIGHT FOR PEROT 
SO MUCH FOR PEROT'S CLAIM THAT HE HAS NO SPIN DOCTORS 
SO THEN THAT'S WHAT GOES ON IN THIS ROOM 
IF IT WASN'T NAILED TO THE BUILDING IT MIGHT FLY OUT INTO ORBIT
