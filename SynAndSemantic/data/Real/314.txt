IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHITEWATER SAGA IS CLAIMING A CASUALTY AT THE WHITE HOUSE JUDY 
SOURCES TELL C. N. N. THAT WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL BERNARD NUSSBAUM MAY BE OUT BY THE END OF THIS DAY AND OUR SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WOLF BLITZER JOINS US WITH THE LATEST 
BERNIE IT DOES INDEED LOOK VERY LIKELY THAT WHITEWATER IS ABOUT TO CLAIM ANOTHER VICTIM 
WHITE HOUSE SOURCES SAY IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE PRESIDENT CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL BERNARD NUSSBAUM WILL RESIGN UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FOR HIS HANDLING OF THE WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION 
THREE TIMES FRIDAY MR. CLINTON WAS OMINOUSLY SILENT WHEN DIRECTLY ASKED ABOUT FUTURE 
THE PRESIDENT DID LASH OUT BITTERLY AT HIS REPUBLICAN CRITICS 
I THINK THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEHAVED IN A FAIRLY BLATANT BALD AND TOTALLY POLITICAL WAY IN THIS REGARD 
MR. CLINTON STRONGLY REPEATED A WARNING TO HIS STAFF 
I THINK I HAVE SENT A VERY CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS SIGNAL THAT THERE'S NO POINT IN LETTING A PROCESS MESS THIS WHITE HOUSE UP WHEN WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACCUSED OF ANY WRONGDOING 
ON THURSDAY NUSSBAUM SUFFERED A MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT WHEN WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MAC MCLARTY ISSUED A MEMO REMOVING NUSSBAUM FROM AUTHORIZING WHITE HOUSE CONTACTS WITH AGENCIES INVESTIGATING WHITEWATER 
OFFICIALS ALSO POINT TO EDITORIALS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THE WASHINGTON POST AND OTHER NEWSPAPERS QUESTIONING JUDGMENT 
AND FOR NUSSBAUM THE HANDWRITING NOW IS CLEARLY ON THE WALL AND EVEN SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS ARE PREDICTING HE'LL DO THE RIGHT THING RESIGN 
BERNIE 
THANK YOU WOLF 
WILL A SHAKEUP AT THE WHITE HOUSE HURT OR HELP PRESIDENT CLINTON ON WHITEWATER 
NEXT ON INSIDE POLITICS WE'LL EXPLORE THAT AND MORE WITH OUR GUESTS MARGARET CARLSON AND JACK GERMOND
