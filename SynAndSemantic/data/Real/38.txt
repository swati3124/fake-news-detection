SOME IMMIGRANTS WHO'VE ALREADY MADE IT TO A NEW LIFE IN AMERICA LOST ALL THEY HAD WHEN RIOTS BROKE OUT IN L. A. A FEW WEEKS AGO 
BUT MANY ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE DESPITE THE SETBACKS AS C. N. N.'S GREG LAMOTTE REPORTS 
THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT'S WHAT IRANIAN BORN MARK WAS HOPING TO FIND WHEN HE MOVED HERE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WITH FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET 
HE MANAGED TO PUT HIMSELF THROUGH COLLEGE AND EVENTUALLY SAVED ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A DISCOUNT STORE IN LOS ANGELES 
THE DREAM WAS I ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE MY OWN BOSS 
THOUGHT HE HAD ESCAPED THE OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE OF IRAN UNTIL HE WAS TOLD HE AND HIS FAMILY WOULD BE KILLED IF THEY TRIED TO DEFEND THEIR STORE AGAINST AND LOOTERS 
THE FLED AND WHEN THEY RETURNED THEY FOUND THEIR DREAM HAD BEEN BURNED TO THE GROUND 
THE DAY THAT WE WENT TO THE STORE MY FATHER WAS GOING LIKE THIS TO HIS HEAD STILL FROM THE OLD COUNTRY AND SAID EVERYTHING WE WORKED FOR EVERYTHING WE DID IS GONE 
WE WENT THROUGH THIS IN IRAN AND WE LOST EVERYTHING AND WE CAME HERE WE TRIED TO STAND ON OUR FEET AND WE LOST EVERYTHING HERE AGAIN 
BANG KIM CAME TO THE STATES FROM SOUTH KOREA IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
SHE AND HER HUSBAND AND SAVED UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY A GROCERY STORE 
IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE HAD BEEN STOLEN 
THERE WAS A LOT OF SACRIFICE AND HEARTACHE TO BUILD UP TO WHERE WE ARE NOW 
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING REALLY HARD TO TAKE 
KOREAN OWNED BUSINESSES SUFFERED THE MOST DAMAGE AMONG ALL THE IMMIGRANTS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS 
BUT KIM SAYS SHE WON'T QUIT UNTIL AS SHE PUT IT SHE RETIRES FROM THE EARTH 
LEONARDO MADONNA FEELS THE SAME WAY 
HIS PIECE OF THE AMERICAN PIE WAS IN THE FORM OF A RESTAURANT HE OPENED AFTER FLEEING THE DEATH SQUADS OF EL SALVADOR IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
HIS BUSINESS IS NOW IN ASHES BUT HIS SPIRIT REMAINS INTACT 
MY BUSINESS MEANS MONEY TO ME 
NOW I DON'T HAVE IT ANY MORE 
BUT WE ARE HARD WORKING PEOPLE SO WE'LL START ALL OVER AGAIN 
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO REBUILD SOME DETERMINED MORE THAN EVER TO AS THEY SAY MAKE IT IN AMERICA 
IT'S THAT KIND OF IMMIGRANT DETERMINATION AND SPIRIT THAT BUILT THIS NATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
