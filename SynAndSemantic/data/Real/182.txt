HELLO 
I'M JEFF LEVINE 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE REFORM PLAN BUT THE BRAIN TRUST THAT DEVELOPED MUCH OF THE THEORY IS KNOWN AS THE JACKSON HOLE GROUP 
IT'S LOCATED IN WYOMING 
NOW THIS INFLUENTIAL ORGANIZATION IS CONCERNED THE WHITE HOUSE MAY BE GOING THE WRONG WAY 
AND THE JACKSON HOLE MESSAGE IS HITTING HOME AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS 
AMONG THE SPECTACULAR PEAKS SURROUNDING JACKSON HOLE WYOMING DOCTOR PAUL ELLWOOD IS CONDUCTING DOWN TO EARTH DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HEALTH CARE REFORM AND HE'S CLEARLY WORRIED 
IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER PRESIDENT CLINTON ADVOCATES IS GOOD RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE CHANGED WHEN IT GETS OVER TO CONGRESS 
ELLWOOD AND ECONOMIST ALLEN DEVELOPED THE THEORY OF MANAGED COMPETITION OVER THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS 
THE IDEA SEEKS TO ENHANCE BUYING POWER IN THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE BY GROUPING THEM TOGETHER 
THESE GROUPS COULD HELP SLOW THE INCREASE IN MEDICAL COSTS BY NEGOTIATING THE BEST DEALS WITH DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS 
PRESIDENT CLINTON ENDORSED THE CONCEPT DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND MEMBERS OF HIS HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE SUGGEST REFORMS ALONG THE MANAGED COMPETITION LINE TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE ECONOMICAL AND ACCESSIBLE 
BUT 
WE ARE NOT PURISTS OR IDEOLOGUES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL 
WE'RE AFTER SOMETHING THAT WORKS THAT DRAWS ON COMPETITION AS APPROPRIATE AND GUARANTEES EVERYBODY ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE COVERAGE 
SENATOR JAY ROCKEFELLER IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S HEALTH REFORM EFFORT 
YOU INTEGRATE COST CONTROL WITH MANAGED COMPETITION BECAUSE UNLESS YOU DO IT HEALTH CARE AS A REFORMED SYSTEM FAILS 
THAT UPSETS ELLWOOD AN OPPONENT OF COST CONTROL 
I WON'T SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE'LL DISTORT THE WAY THE SYSTEM BEHAVES THAT I WANT A HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S COMMITTED TO PATIENTS NOT COMMITTED TO CONVINCING THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT NEEDS MORE MONEY 
BOY THAT HORSE REALLY ACTED UP 
ELLWOOD SAYS THE BEST WAY TO RIDE HERD ON SOARING HEALTH CARE COSTS IS TRUE COMPETITION BUT HE REJECTS THE CHARGE HIS JACKSON HOLE GROUP IS ONLY TRYING TO RESCUE A BLOATED HEALTH CARE ESTABLISHMENT 
THEIR KEY TO PROFITABILITY IN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES HAS BEEN TO NOT INSURE THAT FOUR PERCENT LET THE OTHER GUY INSURE THEM 
THE JACKSON HOLE GROUP CONSISTS OF SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL PLAYERS IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND MANY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT LEADERS 
FUNDING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS YEAR COMES FROM INDUSTRY GROUPS 
I THINK THE ONE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE JACKSON HOLE GROUP WAS TO TAKE FAT CATS AS YOU CALL THEM AND MAKE THEM COMMITTED TO REAL REFORM 
ELLWOOD IS CALLED THE FATHER OF THE HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION CONCEPT 
H. M. O.S SEEK TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE EFFICIENT BY EMPHASIZING PREVENTION AND OFFERING SPECIALTY TREATMENT ONLY AS NEEDED 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS NOW USE SOME FORM OF MANAGED CARE 
IF THERE IS A PLACE WHERE THE THEORY OF MANAGED COMPETITION WAS NURTURED IT IS HERE 
THIS TRULY REMARKABLE HOME BELONGS TO DOCTOR PAUL ELLWOOD FOUNDER OF THE JACKSON HOLE GROUP AND A MAN WITH HIS OWN UNIQUE VISION OF HEALTH CARE REFORM 
LIVING ROOM WITH ITS SOARING THIRTY FOOT BEAMS AND SWEEPING MOUNTAIN VISTAS HAS BEEN A STAGE FOR MANY HIGH POWERED DISCUSSIONS 
BUT INSIDE THAT ROOM IS A REMARKABLE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE REALLY PRETTY REGULAR PEOPLE 
LOTS OF THEM ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE ALL OF THEM ARE CONSUMERS OF HEALTH CARE 
ELLWOOD AND MANY OF HIS JACKSON HOLE DISCIPLES THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON'S REFORM PLAN WON'T BE MANAGED COMPETITION BUT RATHER A GOVERNMENT RUN SYSTEM IN DISGUISE 
HE GOT MOVED TO THE LEFT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT 
THE TASK FORCE'S HEALTH PLAN INVOLVES MUCH MORE GOVERNMENT THAN MANAGED COMPETITION DOES MUCH MORE IN THE WAY OF TAXES AND MUCH MORE IN THE WAY OF THE GOVERNMENT TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED 
I THINK PAUL IS RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT 
BARNARD HEADS BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD THE NATION'S LARGEST INSURER 
HE'S ALSO A JACKSON HOLE 
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE A MARKET WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY 
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO TURN IT INTO A GOVERNMENT OPERATED BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM 
THE MORE LIBERAL REFORMERS AMONG THE DEMOCRATS DO ADVOCATE A BIGGER ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT AND THEY SAY THEY'LL SWING HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON TO THEIR SIDE 
I THINK THAT THE PLAN THAT SHE OUTLINED FOR US TODAY IS MOVED A LONG WAY AWAY FROM WHAT CAME DOWN OFF THE MOUNTAIN IN WYOMING AND IT'S CALLED MANAGED COMPETITION 
BUT WHETHER HE'S UP IN THE GRAND OR VISITING KEY LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL IDEAS GET A GOOD RECEPTION 
AND THESE DAYS HE'S TRYING TO MOVE THE PRESIDENT BACK TO WHAT ELLWOOD CALLS THE CENTER 
I'M NOT TRYING TO STOP THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN 
I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT TO COME OUT WITH A PLAN THAT EVERYBODY CAN EMBRACE 
BUT SOME SAY THAT ELLWOOD AND HIS JACKSON HOLE FREE MARKET ADVOCATES WILL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IF THEY DON'T GET THEIR WAY 
MRS. CLINTON IS UNDER FIERCE CROSS PRESSURES UNBELIEVABLE OF SELF INTEREST AND POWER ARE COMING AT HER WITH SORT OF BOTTOM LINE DEMANDS IF YOU DON'T DO THIS DON'T COUNT ON OUR SUPPORT 
CAPITOL HILL BACKERS SAY THEY'RE DISENCHANTED WITH THE TASK FORCE ADVISING THE PRESIDENT ON HEALTH CARE REFORM 
CONGRESSMAN COOPER HAS HIS OWN ALTERNATIVE PLAN WAITING IN THE WINGS 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEIR PROCESS ENDED UP MAKING ANYONE HAPPY INCLUDING THE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE TASK FORCE 
I THINK THERE'S A RISK THAT YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING WITH A MANAGED COMPETITION RHETORIC AND THE SINGLE PAYER SOCIALIZED SYSTEM AS THE REAL BASIS 
AND THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER 
IN SCHEME CONSUMERS WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO JOIN H. M. O.S BASED ON INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
IRONICALLY THE INVENTOR OF THE H. M. O. CONCEPT IS NOT HIMSELF A MEMBER 
THERE ISN'T AN H. M. O. IN WYOMING BUT I'D GO TO IT IF WE HAD ONE AND IF IT PROVIDED GOOD CARE 
IN THE MEANTIME ELLWOOD IS HEDGING HIS BETS 
IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ADOPT HIS SCHEME HE'LL USE HIS CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL CLOUT TO TRY TO GET MANAGED COMPETITION ADOPTED STATE BY STATE 
STILL THE MAN FROM JACKSON HOLE WANTS TO BRING HIS VISION FOR REFORM TO THE ENTIRE NATION WHICH HE BELIEVES WILL LEAD TO BETTER HEALTH 
THAT'S WHAT HEALTH CARE IS ALL ABOUT 
IT'S NOT USING IT 
WE GOT TO EAT RIGHT AND GET PLENTY OF EXERCISE AND GET OUT TO PLACES LIKE THIS WITH OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND FEEL LOVED 
CRITICS HE'S BEEN BREATHING THE HIGH MOUNTAIN AIR FOR TOO LONG BUT FROM HIS JACKSON HOLE VISTA ALL SEEMS POSSIBLE 
PAUL REACH EXTENDS ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE
