THANKS FOR JOINING US 
PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE TESTS ARE UNDERWAY IN BOTH OREGON AND WASHINGTON AT THIS HOUR 
GEORGE BUSH WHO HAS A NUMERICAL LOCK ON THE G. O. P. NOMINATION IS EXPECTED TO WIN IN A WALK IN BOTH STATES 
BILL CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO COME OUT AHEAD ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE 
ALREADY HE HAS MORE THEN SIXTY PERCENT OF THE DELEGATES HE NEEDS FOR NOMINATION 
CLINTON'S CURRENT STRATEGY FINE TUNING THEMES FOR A FALL FACE OFF AGAINST THE INCUMBENT 
ONE ISSUE ON HIS AGENDA AIDS 
HE RAISED IT LAST NIGHT AT A RALLY IN HOLLYWOOD 
C. N. N.'S CHARLES BIERBAUER IS WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN 
HE HAS OUR REPORT 
GOVERNOR CLINTON TOLD THE GAY AND LESBIAN RALLY THERE'D BE AN AIDS CZAR IN HIS ADMINISTRATION AND A REAL WAR AGAINST AIDS 
ONE PERSON SHOULD BE IN CHARGE 
ONE PERSON WHO CAN CUT ACROSS ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT'S EAR AND THE PRESIDENT'S ARM 
CLINTON CRITICIZED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR BEING SILENT UNTIL THE FAMOUS FALL SUCH AS MAGIC JOHNSON AND CALLED ON THE PENTAGON TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS 
THE PENTAGON HAD A STUDY WHICH SAID THERE WAS NO REASON NOT TO 
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY PERSONALLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT NOT CHANGING THE RULE SAID IT WAS A LITTLE RULE 
CLINTON SAID THE AIDS PROBLEM WILL GET PROMINENT NOTICE AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
WHILE THE STANCE ON AIDS MAY WIN APPLAUSE SOME DEMOCRATS MAY BE LESS COMFORTABLE WITH CLINTON'S BOLD EMBRACE OF THE GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITY 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER CLINTON'S OUTREACH TO THE GAY COMMUNITY COULD TURN AGAINST HIM IN SOME OF THE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS RIGHT AREAS OF SOME OF THE REAGAN DEMOCRATS 
AND THAT'S POSSIBLE 
THE HOLLYWOOD RALLY CAME AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK IN WHICH CLINTON PLANS TO SPELL OUT HIS VIEWS ON FAMILY VALUES 
THAT WILL COME IN A SPEECH THURSDAY IN CLEVELAND 
HE CLEARLY INTENDS TO SERVE NOTICE THAT GEORGE BUSH EVEN WITH BARBARA THE GRAND KIDS AND THE DOGS DOES NOT HAVE A MONOPOLY CLAIM ON FAMILY ISSUES 
CLINTON HAS MADE HEAD TO HEAD CHALLENGES TO THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES FROM FOREIGN POLICY TO THE ECONOMY 
CLINTON HIMSELF HAS A LOT TO DO NOW 
THE CONVENTION DELEGATES WILL PRETTY MUCH TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES BY JUNE SECOND 
BUT THE FULL SIZE CAMPAIGN MUST BE BUILT IN LITTLE ROCK AND THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MUST BE FOR THE FALL 
CLINTON AIDES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS BUFFETED BY THE CHARACTER ACCUSATIONS OF THE EARLY PRIMARY AND STILL NEEDS TO DEFINE HIMSELF FOR MANY VOTERS 
THAT MAKES THIS NEXT PHASE OF THE CAMPAIGN CRITICAL FOR CLINTON SINCE WHATEVER IMAGE HE CARRIES OUT OF IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET HIM THROUGH THE FALL ELECTION
