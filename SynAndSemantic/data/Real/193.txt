WHETHER THE NEED IS TO GET BRAVE OR GET BRACES AS WE'LL SEE TODAY THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN DENTISTRY 
WELCOME 
I'M DAN RUTZ 
IMAGINE YOURSELF SITTING IN A DENTIST CHAIR FEELING ILL AT EASE 
SUDDENLY YOU'RE TRANSPORTED INTO A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN LIKE THIS 
THAT'S ONE OF THE COPING SKILLS SOME PEOPLE LEARN TO HELP OVERCOME THEIR UNNATURAL FEAR OF DENTISTRY 
MOST PEOPLE CAN THINK OF A LOT THEY'D RATHER DO THAN HAVE THEIR TEETH EXAMINED 
FOR EILEEN CARTER EVEN THE MOST ROUTINE CARE IS AN ORDEAL 
IT'S TAKEN THREE SESSIONS WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST JUST TO GET AS FAR AS THE DOOR BUT AFTER A LIFETIME OF FEAR CARTER IS DETERMINE TO CONQUER THIS 
I'VE HAD YEARS OF PAIN ALREADY AND I KNOW WHEN YOU JUST SAY THE WORD DENTIST IT UP YEARS OF PAIN STARTING WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD 
SHE RECALLS THE FIRST DENTIST SHE EVER SAY 
HE SAID SHE HAD TWENTY FIVE CAVITIES THAT DAY AND STARTED FILLING THEM WITH NO PAIN KILLERS 
CARTER SAID SHE KICKED THE DENTIST AND HE REFUSED TO SEE HER AGAIN 
DOCTOR RONALD DIRECTOR OF THE U. C. L. A. DENTAL FEAR AND ANXIETY PROGRAM IS WILLING TO WAIT AS LONG AS IT TAKES FOR PATIENTS LIKE CARTER TO BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH HIM 
THE GOALS OF HIS FIRST VISIT ARE MODEST A LOOK THROUGH THE MOUTH WITH A PLASTIC MIRROR AND MAYBE SOME X. RAYS 
LET'S DO THIS 
LET ME JUST HAVE YOU SIT IN THE CHAIR AND WE'LL PRACTICE BREATHING FOR A FEW SECONDS 
OKAY 
OKAY 
I'M GOING TO SET THE CHAIR ALL THE WAY UP FOR YOU 
TO CARTER IT MIGHT AS WELL BE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR 
AND WHILE YOU SIT THERE I'M GOING TO PUT MY GOWN ON 
OKAY 
WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT ZERO TO TEN SCALE 
I'M ABOUT EIGHT 
WELL LET'S DO SOME BREATHING 
I'LL LOOK AT YOUR TEETH JUST WITH A MIRROR 
LET'S WAIT A MINUTE 
OKAY 
HOW'RE YOU DOING EILEEN 
NOT GOOD 
OKAY 
DON'T FORGET TO BREATHE 
AT TIMES LIKE THESE SHE FEELS TRAPPED 
I'M IN THE CHAIR AND HE'S LOOKING IN MY MOUTH AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE AN OPTION TO GET UP AND GO BECAUSE I'M THERE ALREADY AND I'M PAYING FOR THE SERVICE AND I'M THERE AND I DON'T FEEL I COULD GET UP AND GO 
OKAY NOW WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO SAY I'M DOING FINE BUT CAN I TAKE A BREAK 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A NICE WAY OF PUTTING IT I'M DOING FINE 
THAT'S NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS RIGHT 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
PSYCHOLOGIST KENNETH WORKS CLOSELY WITH TO HELP PATIENTS LEARN TO TAKE CONTROL OVER THEIR DENTAL TREATMENT 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FEEL ENTITLED TO ASSERT YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION TO TALK TO THE DENTIST OR ANY PRACTITIONER FOR THAT MATTER 
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING HELP YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU 
I'M FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE I NEED TO SHIFT MY POSITION CAN WE PAUSE FOR THIRTY SECONDS 
I THINK THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STRONG WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT 
AND THE LAST AND VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE TREATMENT IS TO TEACH THE PATIENT TO RE WRITE THEIR INNER SCRIPT THEIR INNER DIALOGUE 
THIS IS WHERE INSTEAD OF SAYING OH OH SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN THEY SAY THEY TAKE A DEEP BREATH THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE FEELING ANXIOUS AND THEY TALK TO THEMSELVES IN A POSITIVE WAY SUCH AS I RECOGNIZE I'M FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE I NEED TO FOCUS ON MY DEEP BREATHING I KNOW I CAN HANDLE THIS I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE IT'S DIFFICULT BUT I CAN MAKE THE BEST OF IT 
CAN YOU IMAGINE WATCHING A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET OVER THE OCEAN 
IMAGES WHICH HE SAYS CARRY PEOPLE AWAY FROM FEAR OF PAIN AND DISCOMFORT 
YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING MENTALLY IN THE DENTAL OFFICE 
YOU CAN DIRECT YOUR MIND AND THIS IS WHAT COPING IS ABOUT IS ABOUT DIRECTING YOUR MIND 
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT VERY SLOWLY AND TELL ME IF YOU NEED A BREAK AND TELL ME IF YOU NEED A DRINK OF WATER 
OKAY 
MAYBE START IN THE FRONT FIRST 
SURE 
BUT IMAGES ARE NOT ENOUGH TO STEM THE TEARS OR FEARS ON THIS VISIT 
I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
IT'S OKAY 
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH 
YOU KNOW MY EXPECTATION WAS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WITHOUT CRYING AND WITHOUT SHOWING ANY VULNERABILITY 
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF 
I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WAITED A LONG TIME TO DO RIGHT 
YEAH I DID WAIT A LONG TIME TO DO IT 
AND IF I WASN'T IN PAIN I WOULDN'T BE HERE 
NOW DON'T MISTAKE TEARS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT 
WHAT'D YOU SAY BEFORE I GIVE MYSELF SOME SLACK 
THAT'S RIGHT 
TIME MUST NOT BE FINITE WITH THEM BECAUSE EVERYONE'S NEEDS WILL BE DIFFERENT AND YOU MAY NEED TO SPEND ONE OR TWO APPOINTMENTS JUST IN THE CONSULTATION PHASE BEFORE YOU DO ANY PHYSICAL WORK 
TO FELLOW DENTISTS UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT RUSHING THINGS WITH PATIENTS 
IN EXTREME CASES HE IS EVEN WILLING TO PUT THEM TO SLEEP IN AN OPERATING ROOM AS HE ONCE DID ROUTINELY AT GREAT COST AND INCONVENIENCE 
BUT THEN I STARTED TO REALIZE I CREATED A POPULATION OF PATIENTS THAT WERE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON ME AND TOTALLY DEPENDENT UPON ANESTHESIA AND THEY'VE NEVER OVERCOME THEIR FEAR 
BELIEVES THE COMBINATION OF PSYCHOTHERAPY PATIENT EDUCATION AND MILD CAN HELP MAINSTREAM PATIENTS INTO ACCEPTING ROUTINE CARE 
COHEN IS ONE WHO HAS MADE IT 
FOR ME IT WAS REALLY LEARNING TO TRUST TO SOMEWHERE THAT WAS DAMAGED EARLY 
MANY SUFFER FOR YEARS THEY SAY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND 
I WOULD THE SUBJECT AND THEY WOULD SAY YES EVERYONE'S NERVOUS OR OH EVERYONE'S AFRAID OF DENTISTRY OR SURE IT HURTS BUT YOU KNOW 
TO EILEEN CARTER A MEETING WITH A FORMER DENTAL INSPIRES HOPE 
I'VE MADE MY FIRST STEP TODAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST IS GOING TO BRING BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT EVENTUALLY I'LL BE ABLE TO BE COMFORTABLE AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE IN A DENTIST'S OFFICE 
THE GARDEN ESCAPE ISN'T NECESSARY FOR EVERYONE 
IN FACT SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE INVOLVED IN THEIR DENTAL CARE
