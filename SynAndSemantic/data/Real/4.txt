SPINAL CORD INJURIES CONSIGN THOUSANDS TO LIFE IN WHEEL CHAIRS 
NOW SOME ARE STANDING AGAIN HOWEVER BRIEFLY WITH THE HELP OF BRACES THAT LOOK LIKE SHOES 
ANDREW HOLTZ REPORTS 
DESPITE A CAR CRASH THAT LEFT HIM PARALYZED RICHARD STILL MANAGES TO GET OUT AND ABOUT 
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE DESTINATIONS IS THE LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA HARBOR WHERE HE WORKED AS A COMMERCIAL DIVER UNTIL HIS INJURY 
I REALLY MISS MY JOB 
I WAS GOOD AT WHAT I DID 
AND ALTHOUGH A WHEELCHAIR GIVES HIM MOBILITY THERE ARE THINGS WHEELS CANNOT REPLACE 
LOOKING AT PEOPLE EYE TO EYE 
LOOKING DOWN AT THINGS FROM A STANDING POSITION 
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE IN PERSPECTIVE 
SO EACH DAY RICHARD STRAPS ON A PAIR OF HEAVY STIFF KNEE HIGH BLACK BOOTS AND GOES FOR A WALK 
IT TAKES A MINUTE TO JUST LET THINGS STABILIZE BECAUSE YOU DON'T STAND UP ALL THE TIME 
RICHARD LEGS ARE STILL PARALYZED 
WHAT THE BOOTS DO IS GIVE HIM THE STABILITY TO STAND WHILE HE USES HIS UPPER BODY MUSCLES TO THROW HIS FEET FORWARD ONE STEP AT A TIME 
JUST LET ME TRY GOING FOR IT 
YEAH I AM 
DON'T WORRY 
OKAY 
OKAY SO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT 
I DON'T LIKE HER TO HELP ME 
IT'S ONE OF THEM THINGS YOU KNOW 
HE NEEDS ME TO HELP HIM 
LEG BRACES ARE NOT NEW 
DESIGNERS HOPE THAT BY BEING EASIER TO USE AND LOOKING MORE LIKE REGULAR SHOES THESE BOOTS WILL APPEAL TO USERS MORE THAN THE OLD STYLE BRACES 
MOST OF THE OLDER BRACING SYSTEMS WITHIN A YEAR AFTER PEOPLE MASTER THEM THOSE DEVICES ARE SITTING IN A CLOSET SOMEWHERE 
MASTERING LEG BRACES IS NOT EASY 
A LOT OF STRETCHING AND RIGOROUS EXERCISES AND YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH YOUR BODY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK HOW IT USED TO WORK 
THE EXERCISE CAN BE IMPORTANT 
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT PATIENTS WHO SIT IN A WHEEL CHAIR ALL DAY IS THAT THEY ARE SEDENTARY AND THEY GET OUT OF SHAPE 
THEY HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS 
PUTTING WEIGHT AND STRESS ON LEGS MAY ALSO BE A WAY TO PREVENT BONE LOSS OR OSTEOPOROSIS 
THE BENEFITS DON'T COME CHEAPLY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE BOOTS AND THEN FIFTEEN DOLLARS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THERAPY AND TRAINING 
RICHARD SAYS PRODDING HIS INSURANCE COMPANY INTO PAYING FOR THE PROGRAM WAS THE TOUGHEST PART OF GETTING BACK ON HIS FEET 
PERHAPS ONLY ONE IN EIGHT CAN USE THIS TYPE OF BRACING BOOT 
USUALLY THEY HAVE RECENT INJURIES TO A SMALL SECTION OF SPINAL CORD AND THEY MUST HAVE GOOD MUSCLE TONE IN THEIR LEGS COMBINED WITH A LOT OF UPPER BODY STRENGTH 
I STAND A COUPLE HOURS A DAY AND IT HAS REALLY TURNED THINGS AROUND AS FAR AS THAT GOES 
FEELING LIKE I'M I'M A STANDING PERSON AND SOMETIMES I SIT 
IT'S AN ATTITUDE HE'S ACHIEVED BY CONCENTRATING ON PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER 
AS THE EVENTS IN LOS ANGELES AND OTHER CITIES PAINFULLY DEMONSTRATE THIS PAST WEEK VIOLENCE IS ONE OF THE LEADING HEALTH THREATS IN THE UNITED STATES 
ANDREW HOLTZ HAS PREPARED A WEEK LONG SERIES OF REPORTS
