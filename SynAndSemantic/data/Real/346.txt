THESE ARE THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THAT LIGHT A FIRE 
THE RISKS ARE HIGH NOT ONLY ON THE CASINO FLOOR BUT UPSTAIRS IN THE EXECUTIVE SUITE 
NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN ARTHUR GOLDBERG HEAD OF MANUFACTURING WHICH RUNS FIVE CASINOS NATIONWIDE 
THE BARGES 
WE BOUGHT THE BARGES TO CONSTRUCT THE CASINO IN BILOXI 
TO ME THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF MY JOB COMING UP WITH A PRODUCT THAT FITS THAT FITS TODAY THAT MAY HAVE TO CHANGE TO FIT TOMORROW 
IN NINETEEN NINETY WHEN ARTHUR TOOK OVER AS CHAIRMAN AND C. E. O. MANUFACTURING WAS DOWN ON ITS LUCK 
IT WAS NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT 
ITS LAS VEGAS CASINO IN BANKRUPTCY 
ITS HEALTH AND FITNESS ARM UP FOR SALE 
GOLDBERG CAME TO THE RESCUE IN A ROUND A BOUT WAY 
ARE YOU THE EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR 
YEAH I'M TRYING TO BE 
HE ACQUIRED A FIVE PERCENT STAKE IN THE COMPANY THEN WATCHED AS THE STOCK PLUMMETED TO AROUND TWO DOLLARS A SHARE 
SO GOLDBERG ROLLED THE DICE BETTING HE COULD RETURN TO THE BLACK 
HE PRESENTED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO THE BOARD THE BOARD LIKED IT AND MADE HIM BET HIS FULL STAKE 
IT NAMED HIM CHAIRMAN AND C. E. O. WITH A MANDATE TO FIX THE COMPANY 
THERE WAS A SLIGHT PROBLEM GOLDBERG HAD NO EXPERIENCE RUNNING A GAMING OR FITNESS COMPANY 
THE BULK OF HIS CAREER HAD BEEN AS AN INVESTOR A LAWYER WHO HAS BEEN CALLED A CORPORATE RAIDER 
GOLDBERG SHOWED HIS MUSCLE FIRMING UP A BALANCE SHEET SLASHING COSTS TRIMMING DEBT 
IS WELL ON THE ROAD TO PROFITABILITY AND GOLDBERG IS HAPPY WITH HIS STOCK HOLDINGS 
ALL I CAN SAY IS I HAVEN'T SOLD ANY 
ARTHUR GOLDBERG HAS MADE A CAREER OUT OF PICKING WINNING COMPANIES BUT IRONICALLY HE DIDN'T CHOOSE 
THE STOCK TIP CAME FROM HIS WIFE 
ARTHUR BET ON HER AND NOW THE GAMBLE SEEMS TO BE PAYING OFF 
ARTHUR GOLDBERG OF MANUFACTURING NEXT ON PINNACLE 
RISING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IS A TOWN LIKE NO OTHER 
LAS VEGAS NEVADA ONCE A SLEEPY DESERT PIT STOP TURNED INTO AMERICA'S GAMBLING MECCA BY A GANGSTER 
MANUFACTURING GOT ITS START IN THE GAMING BUSINESS MAKING SLOT MACHINES 
TODAY IT OWNS FIVE CASINOS NATIONWIDE INCLUDING THE TWO THOUSAND ROOM LAS VEGAS 
WE HAVE THE SUPER BOWL WE HAVE MRS. CLINTON 
I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO GET ME A ROOM 
MORE CASINOS ARE PLANNED AS GAMBLING FEVER SWEEPS COMMUNITIES LOOKING FOR A FAST WAY TO MAKE A TAX DOLLAR 
HAS TWO PROPERTIES IN ATLANTIC CITY THE PARK PLACE AND THE GRAND 
THAT'S WHERE WE MET ARTHUR GOLDBERG CHAIRMAN AND C. E. O. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY IN AN ELABORATE SUITE RESERVED FOR HIGH ROLLERS PEOPLE WHO GAMBLE ON AVERAGE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEKEND 
ARTHUR LET'S START BACK A WAYS BACK A LONG WAYS 
YOU WANTED TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL YOU WENT TO LAW 
WHY 
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE LAW THAT INTERESTED YOU 
WELL BILL AT THAT TIME WHEN I WAS IN MY LAST YEAR AT RUTGERS I HAD A FRIEND WHOSE FATHER WAS A GREAT FEDERAL JUDGE 
HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WHEN I GRADUATED 
HE ASKED ME I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW 
AND HE SAID I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL 
SO HE TOLD ME TO TAKE THE LAW SCHOOL TESTS AND HE WROTE ME A LETTER AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW I WAS A STUDENT AT LAW SCHOOL 
YOU WENT ON YOU JOINED A LAW FIRM YOU BECAME A TRIAL LAWYER AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY GAVE IT UP 
DURING A PERIOD OF MY LAW PRACTICE MY FATHER HAD HIS FOURTH HEART ATTACK 
AND WE HAD A VERY SMALL FAMILY HELD BUSINESS AT THAT TIME WHOSE ASSETS WERE TINY BUT THEY WERE REALLY ALL THAT WE HAD 
SO I TOOK A SIX MONTH LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO EITHER SELL THAT OR SEE WHAT COULD HAPPEN 
AND I NEVER WENT BACK TO THE PRACTICE OF LAW 
ARTHUR TURNED HIS TRUCKING COMPANY INTO ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE NATION EVENTUALLY SELLING IT FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS 
THE MONEY HELPED LAUNCH HIS CAREER AS AN INVESTOR 
AFTER THE TRUCKING COMPANY YOU KIND OF WENT THROUGH A SERIES OF COMPANIES SORT OF BUY INTO IT OPERATE CLICK SELL IT BUY IN OPERATE CLICK SELL IT 
WHY 
WHY DID YOU IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING 
WELL PEOPLE ASK ME THE QUESTION WELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AT AND THE BASIC DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS BUSINESS ALLOWS ME TO BE INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING THAT CAN INFLUENCE DEMAND 
THE BUSINESSES THAT I HAD BEEN IN PRIOR THERE TO TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CURVES WERE RELATIVELY THE SAME 
ONE OF THE BUSINESS FOR INSTANCE BILL WAS MANUFACTURING OF BOMBS 
WELL THE U. S. GOVERNMENT TOLD US HOW MANY BOMBS TO MAKE AND WE COULDN'T INFLUENCE THE DEMAND FOR BOMBS OR HOPEFULLY WE COULDN'T INFLUENCE THE DEMAND FOR BOMBS 
WE'RE HERE 
IT'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF FUN BEING INVOLVED IN AN INDUSTRY THAT'S CHANGED MORE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THAN IT DID IN THE FIRST THIRTY 
YOU WERE BUILDING UP STAKES IN COMPANIES SELLING THEM BACK 
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THE CHARGES 
YOU WERE CALLED A 
YOU WERE CALLED A FAST BUCK OPERATOR 
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ANSWER THOSE CHARGES 
WELL YOU KNOW I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEFINE THEM 
I NEVER WENT TO SOMEONE AND ASKED THEM TO BUY STOCK 
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT WAS A TERM WHERE A WEAK EXECUTIVE WHO WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS JOB THAN HIS SHAREHOLDERS RUSHED OUT TO BUY SHARES TO PROTECT THAT JOB 
I THINK IT'S WRONG 
I THINK THAT IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN 
BUT IF SOMEONE COMES TO ME AND WANTS TO BUY SOMETHING AND I WANT TO SELL IT THAT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT I THINK IS FINE 
IN ALL GOLDBERG AND HIS PARTNERS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE MADE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM VARIOUS IN AND OUT DEALS 
GOLDBERG THINKS OUT HIS BUSINESS IN HIS DAILY OF JOGGING 
MOST OF RESTRUCTURING WAS THOUGHT UP DURING ONE OF THOSE RUNS 
HE'S ALSO TAKEN ON MARATHONS 
DRAW THE ANALOGY FOR ME BETWEEN RUNNING A MARATHON AND RUNNING A BUSINESS 
SHORTLY AFTER I GOT THIS JOB WITH THE HEALTH AND TENNIS GROUP HAD A CONSORTIUM TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY HAD DONE THE PRIOR YEAR AND WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO THE NEXT YEAR 
AND AT THAT TIME WAS NOT IN GREAT GREAT SHAPE 
AND I USED THE MARATHON AS MY SPEECH 
AND THE HITTING OF THE WALL THE LOOKING AHEAD AND THINKING YOU CAN'T EVEN GO ANOTHER STEP FURTHER AND REALIZING IF YOU JUST KEEP THE ONE FOOT AHEAD OF THE OTHER YOU'LL FINISH 
I THINK YOU HAVE THE SAME OBSTACLES 
YOU CAN'T START TOO EARLY YOU CAN'T SPRINT THE FIRST TWO MILES 
YOU HAVE TO PACE YOURSELF 
YOU HAVE TO DRINK WATER ALONG THE WAY 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME DISCIPLINES AS YOU DO WITH BUSINESS 
ARTHUR WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK HERE 
AND PINNACLE WILL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT 
BESIDES BUSINESS ARTHUR GOLDBERG THRIVES ON EXERCISE 
IT'S REALLY A WAY TO COMPETE WITH YOURSELF 
HE WORKS OUT WITH A PERSONAL TRAINER AT A SPA 
OPERATES THE ONLY NATIONAL CHAIN OF FITNESS CLUBS WHOSE STRING INCLUDING JACK LA CLUBS 
WHY WORK OUT AT 

AEROBIC TRAINERS 

MORE THAN A QUARTER OF ALL AMERICANS WORKING OUT IN A CLUB DO IT AT 
WHICH SIDE OF THE BUSINESS DO YOU LIKE MORE THE GAMING SIDE OR THE HEALTH SIDE 
WELL THAT'S ALMOST LIKE ASKING WHICH OF MY CHILDREN I LIKE BETTER AND I HAPPEN TO LIKE ALL FOUR OF THEM EQUALLY 
THEY'RE BOTH INTERESTING BUSINESSES AND BOTH WITH GREAT FUTURES 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT GAMBLING ON ONE SIDE HEALTH CLUBS ON THE OTHER ARE ALMOST 
ONE IS A SEDENTARY OCCUPATION THE OTHER IS PEOPLE EXERCISING BREAKING INTO A SWEAT 
I'VE SAID PUBLICLY THAT THESE TWO COMPANIES WHILE THEY'RE BOTH EXCELLENT EXCELLENT COMPANIES WITH GOOD GROWTH AHEAD OF THEM PROBABLY BELONG SEPARATED 
SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE BETTER SERVED IF WE SEPARATE THESE COMPANIES 
AND THAT IS BEING REVIEWED NOW 
SO ARE YOU THINKING OF SPINNING OFF 
WELL WE'VE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THAT'S AN OPTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY 
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU STAY WITH 
WELL I THINK FOR A WHILE I WOULD STAY WITH BOTH OF THEM 
MEANWHILE ARTHUR IS EXPANDING HIS GAMBLING OPERATIONS TO INCLUDE A RIVERBOAT IN NEW ORLEANS 
THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR MILLION CASINO IN MISSISSIPPI IS FINISHING ITS FIRST YEAR 
HOW MANY SLOTS WOULD THAT TAKE US TO 
THAT WOULD TAKE US UP TO AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SLOT MACHINES AND KEEP US SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE HUNDRED TABLE GAMES 
AND ARTHUR IS ALSO ENLARGING HIS ATLANTIC CITY PROPERTY 
WE HAVE PURCHASED SOME LAND IN PHILADELPHIA FOR THE FUTURE 
WE'RE ACTIVELY BIDDING IN SAINT LOUIS 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO GAMING IN CHICAGO IF THAT'S TO BE 
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY THE TWO CENTERS LAS VEGAS ATLANTIC CITY 
WE'RE TALKING PHILADELPHIA 
WE'VE GOT UP AND DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI 
THERE ARE CASINOS POPPING UP EVERYWHERE 
THERE IS A FINITE NUMBER OF GAMBLERS 
IS THIS INDUSTRY IN DANGER OF BECOMING TERRIBLY 
I THINK THAT WHERE YOU HAVE UNLIMITED LICENSES EASY MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS 
I MEAN IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BOARDWALK OUTSIDE AND THE NUMBER OF CASINOS ALONG IT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME BOARDWALK WE ALL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES 
THOSE CASINOS THAT CAN MAINTAIN THAT EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR PATRONS DEVELOP NEW EXPERIENCES AND BUILD A FIRST CLASS PRODUCT WILL SUCCEED 
I THINK YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN 
DO I THINK IT'S HERE YET 
NUMBER 
IS IT COMING 
YES 
CASINOS ARE SEARCHING FOR IDENTITY TO COMPETE IN THIS NEW GAMBLING WORLD 
SOME ARE GEARING UP TO ATTRACT THE WHOLE FAMILY 
LAS VEGAS CATERS MORE TO ADULTS ALTHOUGH IT IS PLANNING TO BUILD A MONORAIL TO CONNECT IT TO THE FAMILY ORIENTED M. G. M. GRAND THE LARGEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD 
WHAT KIND OF AN EXECUTIVE ARE YOU 
ARE YOU A HANDS ON I'VE GOT TO BE INVOLVED WITH EVERYTHING OR I'M GOING TO SIT BACK AND DELEGATE 
WELL I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF A LOT OF MICROMANAGEMENT IN MY DAYS 
BUT I HAVE ONE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE THAT I'VE ALWAYS KEPT AND THAT'S I LOOK AT EVERY CHECK OVER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT GOES OUT 
AND I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO BE A VERY VERY GOOD DISCIPLINE 
I DON'T BELIEVE IN A FIRM AND RIGID CHAIN OF COMMAND 
FOR INSTANCE IN LAS VEGAS I WENT THERE EARLY ON AND I BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE PEOPLE IN ROOM SERVICE WHO TAKE THE ORDERS FROM THE CUSTOMERS 
IT GAME ME AN OF WHAT OUR GUESTS THOUGHT 
WHAT WERE OUR GUESTS ORDERING 
WHAT DO THEY WANT 
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST THING ORDERED TODAY SUPER BOWL WEEKEND 
CHEESEBURGERS 
CHEESEBURGERS 
YOU TOOK IT OVER ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT LOSING MONEY 
WHAT DID YOU FEEL YOU HAD TO DO IMMEDIATELY TO TURN IT AROUND 
WELL I LEARNED ONE THING 
I THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY SMART AND I BOUGHT A LOT OF STOCK IN THIS COMPANY 
AND I BOUGHT THE STOCK AT SEVEN DOLLARS AND EIGHT DOLLARS AND BEFORE I KNEW IT IT WAS TWO DOLLARS 
SO BEFORE I 
YOU DECIDED YOU WEREN'T QUITE SO SMART AT THAT POINT 
I REALLY GOT A LESSON IN HUMILITY 
BEFORE I EVEN BECAME A DIRECTOR OF THIS COMPANY I KNEW THAT I HAD MADE A LITTLE BIT OF A MISTAKE AND IT WASN'T QUITE SO ROSY 
AND I HAD WORKED ON A RESTRUCTURING PLAN EVEN BEFORE I TOOK OVER 
ARTHUR ALLOWED HIMSELF THREE YEARS TO CARRY OUT THE PLAN 
HE FINISHED IN TWO CUTTING THE DEBT FROM TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND SOME BUSINESSES 
I HAVE A BUSINESS THEORY WHICH SAYS THAT IF YOU RUN A COMPANY FOR CASH FLOW EARNINGS WILL FOLLOW 
BUT IF YOU RUN A COMPANY FOR EARNINGS AS HAD DONE CASH ISN'T NECESSARILY AVAILABLE 
AND I CAN REMEMBER EARLY ON IN THE EXPERIENCE A REPORTER FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES WAS NICE ENOUGH TO CALL ME FOR AN INTERVIEW 
AND HE SAID WELL WILL YOU BE FACING BANKRUPTCY AND I SAID WELL I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL THE AND IN THE WEEKS THEREAFTER I KEPT THINKING ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW AND STARTED TO THINK B. A BUT EVERYTHING WORKED OUT 
HOW CLOSE DID YOU GET TO THE C. Y. 
WELL I NEVER WOULD ADMIT THEY EXISTED 
THAT ATTITUDE HAS HELPED ARTHUR TRIUMPH IN A COMPLICATED BUSINESS ONE THAT TAKES KNOWLEDGE OF MANY FIELDS CARD TABLES AND SLOTS RESTAURANTS HOTEL MANAGEMENT AND ENTERTAINMENT 
THE LESSON OF EXPERIENCE WHEN PINNACLE CONTINUES 
IN THE GAMING BUSINESS THERE ARE THREE SURE THINGS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE WINNERS A FEW LOSERS A LOT AND THOSE TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM 
WE'RE LOOKING AT A PAST POST ATTEMPT IN 
WE'LL SEE THAT WE'LL CIRCLE THERE 
THE TOP OF THE BOARD IS WHERE THE PLAYER IS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO PUT MONEY DOWN AFTER THE NUMBER HAS LANDED 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH HIM 
IN THIS CASE WE DIDN'T CATCH HIM 
PRETTY QUICK 
I'M GOING TO JUMP WAY BACK 
TELL ME ABOUT THE VERY YOUNG ARTHUR GOLDBERG 
WHAT LESSONS DID YOU CARRY THROUGH 
LESSONS THAT I CARRIED THROUGH IS DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT 
DON'T BE GUIDED BY THE DECISIONS OF IN BUSINESS YOUR COMPETITORS WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK 
A LOT OF TIMES THEIR MOTORS MIGHT BE RIGHT THEY DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS 
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT AND THE REST SHOULD TAKE CARE OF ITSELF 
PIONEERED COMPUTER CARDS FOR STEADY CUSTOMERS 
THESE CARDS LET KNOW HOW MUCH A PERSON IS GAMBLING AND ON WHICH GAMES 
AND WHILE THEY DON'T PAY FOR YOUR GAMBLING YOU CAN WIN POINTS FOR SHOWS AND HOTEL ROOMS 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAMES NO PROBLEM YOU CAN GET INSTRUCTION AND A DEGREE FROM UNIVERSITY 
YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AND IN OUR SOCIETY SUCCESS TRANSLATES AS MONEY 
HOW IMPORTANT IS MONEY TO YOU 
WELL SUCCESS IS GETTING WHAT YOU WANT 
HAPPINESS IS WANTING WHAT YOU GET 
AND I PREFER HAPPINESS 
YOU DON'T PREFER THE MONEY 
I'M FINE 
I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE MONEY 
IT'S SAID YOU'RE AMONG THE RICHEST MEN IN THE NEW YORK NEW JERSEY CONNECTICUT AREA 
WELL I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCURATE BUT I'M COMFORTABLE 
ARTHUR MET HIS WIFE RONNIE WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
SHE WAS FIFTEEN 
THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR THIRTY ONE YEARS AND THE HAVE FOUR CHILDREN ONE GRANDCHILD 
IS YOUR WIFE A PART OF YOUR BUSINESS DECISIONS 
SHE HAS A LOT OF COMMON SENSE 
AND A LOT OF TIMES WE'LL TALK ABOUT GENERAL DECISIONS 
SHE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO GET INTO THE SPECIFICS 
YOU KNOW SHE HAS HER OWN INTERESTS HER OWN CHARITABLE AND EDUCATIONAL INTERESTS 
BUT I THINK THAT THE CASE IS ONE WHERE I WAS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER WE SHOULD DO IT NOT ONLY FOR THE MONETARY END BUT THE TIME END 
IT'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME INVOLVED IN THESE COMPANIES 
AND I THOUGHT IT ONLY FAIR THAT THAT BE A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION 
SO I THINK SHE'S GOT A GOOD DEAL OF COMMON SENSE AND SHE GIVES ME THE IRISH VIEWPOINT ON ISSUES 
WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE MOST DEVASTATING MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE 
MY MOST DEVASTATING MOMENT CLEARLY WAS I THINK WHEN MY FATHER DIED 
YOU DON'T REALIZE IMMORTALITY ET CETERA BUT VERY CLOSE TO MY FATHER 
AND TELLING MY SON THAT HIS GRANDFATHER DIED AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO A NINE YEAR OLD WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME 
HOW DID HE FEEL ABOUT WHAT YOU DID TO HIS COMPANY 
I WAITED UNTIL HE DIED TO SELL IT BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS LIFE 
AND HE WORKED EVERY DAY AND HE DIED AT WORK AND THAT'S WHERE HE SAID HE WOULD DIE 
SO GOING FORWARD I WAITED UNTIL HIS DEMISE AND THEN QUICKLY SOLD THE COMPANY 
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO THINK WHEN THEY HEAR THE NAME ARTHUR GOLDBERG 
WELL I'D LIKE THEM TO THINK THAT I'VE BEEN A FAIR PERSON THROUGHOUT MY CAREER THAT I HAVE TRIED TO CONSTRUCT SOMETHING HERE AT TO GO FORWARD 
AND I'M NOT READY TO WRITE THE LAST CHAPTER YET SO THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MIGHT CHANGE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS 
BUT THESE YOUNG EXECUTIVES COMING UP ARE FINE PEOPLE PROBABLY A LOT MORE INTELLIGENT THAN I WAS COMING UP 
AND TO ME THE ABILITY TO HELP TRAIN SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT THEM FAIRLY ECONOMICALLY LET THEM MAKE DECENT ALL OF OUR PEOPLE DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
I THINK IF I COULD BE REMEMBERED AS GIVING PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES I'D BE VERY HAPPY 
ARTHUR MAY GET HIS WISH 
HE'S ASSEMBLED A WINNING TEAM TO HELP MANAGE MANUFACTURING AND HE ALLOWS THE TEAM TO TAKE ITS OWN CHANCES A STRATEGY THAT PUTS ARTHUR GOLDBERG AT THE PINNACLE
