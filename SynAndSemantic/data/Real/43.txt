WHILE ECONOMISTS SEE THE NUMBERS FAVORABLY DO THEY TRANSLATE FAVORABLY FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS 
WELL C. N. N.'S DON KNAPP CHECKS THE PULSE FROM SAN FRANCISCO 
A WEAK ECONOMY AND A COMPANY CONSOLIDATION COST DAVE HIS BANKING JOB LAST SEPTEMBER 
NOW AFTER EIGHT MONTHS OF UNEMPLOYMENT HE'S BACK MANAGING ANOTHER BANK 
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS THAT I WAS OUT OF WORK NOTHING WAS HAPPENING 
I WASN'T EVEN GETTING INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS 
BUT AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR PEOPLE STARTED WANTING TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND I WAS TALKING TO COMPANIES WHO HAD ACTUAL JOBS 
IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL 
THERE ARE SOME SIGNS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY IN THE FORM OF LOANS 
DEPOSITS ARE STARTING TO GO BACK UP 
THESE ARE ALL SIGNS THAT THINGS ARE PICKING UP 
BUSINESS IS ALSO UP IN THE SHOE REPAIR SHOP SAYS THE MANAGER 
BUT HE SEES IT AS A SIGN THE ECONOMY IS DOWN 
A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE REPAIRING THE SHOES THAT THEY HAVE INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND SPENDING THE MONEY TO BUY NEW SHOES 
WHAT'S THAT SAY TO YOU 
IT SAYS TO ME PEOPLE ARE REALLY STILL LEERY ABOUT SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY 
THE SHOE SHINE BUSINESS IF MEASURED CORRECTLY CAN ALSO BE AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR 
THERE ARE MORE SHOE THAT ARE COMING OUT 
THAT MEANS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOSING JOBS AND THE BELT IS GETTING TIGHT 
BUSINESS IS REAL GOOD 
GOOD 
YES SIR 
WHAT'S THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
THE ECONOMY'S PICKING UP 
IT'S PICKING UP SLOWLY BUT SURELY BUT IT'S PICKING UP 
BICYCLE MESSENGER SAYS HIS BUSINESS IS GOOD BUT HE'S PESSIMISTIC 
WE GET A LOT OF BUSINESS FROM LIKE LAWYERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
IT'S LIKE ALL I CAN THINK OF IS LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOING BANKRUPT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I WOULD BE ABLE TO COME TO THIS POINT AND PROBABLY SEE AROUND FIFTEEN TWENTY PEOPLE STANDING HERE LOOKING FOR A SHUTTLE 
WHEREAS NOW YOU COME HERE THERE'S NOTHING 
TOURISM IS A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S DOWN 
WE HAVE TO DROP OUR RATES TO SELL ROOMS TO THOSE GROUPS AND THOSE GROUPS THAT COME IN ARE GROUPS THAT TRADITIONALLY DON'T TIP AS A RULE 
STATISTICALLY THE ECONOMY MAY BE DOING WELL 
BUT PEOPLE ON SAN FRANCISCO STREETS HAVE TROUBLE BELIEVING THAT 
I THINK A LOT OF THE WHAT THE INDICATORS ARE THE GUYS ARE JUST PLAYING WITH THE STATISTICS 
THAT REALLY ISN'T HAPPENING YET 
THE GOVERNMENT REPORT THAT SHOWED THE ECONOMY GROWING ALSO SAYS PROFITS ARE UP BUT BECAUSE COMPANIES AREN'T HOLDING BACK ON HIRING
