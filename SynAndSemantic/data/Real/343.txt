FINALLY THIS EVENING OUR PERSONS OF THE WEEK LET THE TRUMPETS SOUND MIGHT BE THEIR MOTTO 
WITH ALL THE DEBATE THESE DAYS ABOUT HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO MAKE AMERICA A SAFER PLACE TO LIVE WE'RE REMINDED BY THESE TWO WOMEN THAT GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN PEOPLE GET INVOLVED 
AND THESE WOMEN ARE CERTAINLY INVOLVED 
SO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO 
GO UP AND SAY YEAH AMERICA WORKS BECAUSE I WAS MOLESTED BUT YET THE GUY WALKED AFTER THREE MONTHS 
THESE KIDS ARE SCARRED FOR LIFE 
THIS GOES RIGHT INTO ADULTHOOD 
THE KIDS THEY ARE REFERRING TO ARE NOT THEIR OWN 
AND SHARON SAY THEY'VE BEEN LUCKY NO ONE HAS EVER TRIED TO HARM THEIR CHILDREN NEVER TRIED TO MOLEST THEM 
BUT LIKE MOTHERS EVERYWHERE CHILD MOLESTATION DISTURBS THEM 
MOST MOTHERS DON'T TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME BUT THEY DO 
WHY SO MUCH PASSION 
THE FACT THAT I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN TO MY CHILDREN OR CHILDREN OR MY NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN OR ANY CHILDREN THAT I KNOW 
THAT'S WHERE THE PASSION LIES 
IF SEEMS WORKED UP HERE IS WHY BACK IN FEBRUARY SHE AND HER BEST FRIEND SHARON WHO LIVE OUTSIDE CHICAGO HEARD ON THE LOCAL NEWS THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD PICKED UP A 
AND IN THE PROCESS OF DOING A ROUTINE CHECK HAD DISCOVERED HE WAS A FUGITIVE FROM WASHINGTON STATE ACCUSED OF MOLESTING TWO LITTLE GIRLS 
YET THE POLICE IN MADISON ILLINOIS LET HIM GO 
A PHONE CALL TO POLICE IN SPOKANE CONFIRMED THAT WASHINGTON STATE WAS NOT PREPARED TO PAY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BRING JOSEPH BERNARD DAVIS BACK TO SPOKANE FOR TRIAL 
THEY JUST SAID WELL THE HELL WITH THE KIDS OF ILLINOIS 
WE'RE GOING TO LET HIM OUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE HIM BACK BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY 
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED HALF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM THE SUBURB WHERE SHARON AND LIVE A SUBURB WITH MORE THAN ITS FAIR SHARE OF WELL KEPT STATION WAGONS AND OF COURSE DROVES OF CHILDREN 
THESE TWO MOTHERS FROM THE SUBURBS BURST INTO ACTION 
THE CALLED THE POLICE THE MAYOR AND THEN FINALLY A SPOKANE NEWSPAPER 
CHICAGO'S MAYOR DALEY WAS ENRAGED 
WELL I FEEL SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE OF SPOKANE REALLY 
I REALLY DO 
BECAUSE THERE'S A VICTIM THERE OR VICTIMS AND I GUESS THEY REALLY DON'T CARE FOR THOSE VICTIMS 
WASHINGTON STATE OF COURSE WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT ALL AND DID FINALLY COME UP WITH THE MONEY FOR EXTRADITION 
DAVIS WAS RE ARRESTED TWO DAYS LATER AND FLOWN TO SPOKANE MAINTAINING HIS INNOCENCE 
I KNOW IN MY HEART I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO THOSE CHILDREN 
I TREATED THOSE CHILDREN LIKE MY FAMILY MY CHILDREN 
A SPOKANE COURT WILL DETERMINE HIS GUILT OR INNOCENCE 
BUT SEEING JOSEPH BERNARD DAVIS IN HANDCUFFS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO EXTINGUISH THE ANGER OF TWO SUBURBAN MOTHERS 
IF DAVIS HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF ROBBING A BANK OR OF MURDERING SOMEONE FEDERAL LAW WOULD REQUIRE HIS IMMEDIATE EXTRADITION 
CHILD MOLESTING FALLS UNDER STATE LAW NO EXTRADITION UNLESS REQUESTED 
AND SHARON HAVE TAKEN ON THE BURDEN OF CHANGING THAT CHANGING THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS THEY HAVE ORGANIZED A GROUP CALLED LOCK LOCK OUT CHILD CRIME 
THEY HAVE ALREADY LOBBIED THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO PASS A BILL WHICH WOULD PROVIDE LONGER PRISON TERMS FOR CONVICTED CHILD MOLESTERS 
WE CAN'T LET OUR KIDS WALK TO THE PARK WITHOUT AN ADULT SUPERVISING 
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE AS ADULTS DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO BRING THAT BACK 
THEIR LOCAL CONGRESSMAN IS CERTAINLY ON THEIR SIDE 
HE ALSO WANTS TO MAKE CHILD MOLESTING A FEDERAL OFFENSE 
THESE LADIES REALLY ILLUSTRATE HOW BEING ACTIVE IN YOUR COMMUNITY CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
IF THE LAW IS TO CHANGE IT WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF MANY MORE STATE LEGISLATORS WHICH MEANS MORE MOTHERS WILL HAVE TO GET INVOLVED 
BUT IT'S BEGINNING TO HAPPEN 
SINCE FEBRUARY MOTHERS IN SEVEN OTHER STATES HAVE FORMED CHAPTERS OF LOCK LOBBYING THEIR LEGISLATORS TO GET ON BOARD 
IT IS TOUGH TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM 
BUT AS AND SHARON ARE TEACHING THE REST OF US IT CAN BE DONE 
WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN MY CHILDREN MY NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN ALL THE CHILDREN SO THEY CAN BE SAFE AGAIN 
IT'S UP TO US 
I MEAN MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS 
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TAKE CARE OF MY KIDS 
IT'S A HUMAN ISSUE 
WHICH IS WHY WE CHOOSE AND SHARON SUCH GOOD EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT MERELY COMPLAIN THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING THEY WORK TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE 
AND THAT'S OUR REPORT ON WORLD NEWS TONIGHT 
LATER THIS EVENING TWENTY TWENTY FINDINGS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE AIR YOU BREATHE WHEN YOU FLY 
I'M PETER JENNINGS
