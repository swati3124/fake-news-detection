MIDWESTERNERS AT THE MERCY OF NATURE GOT A PLEDGE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FROM PRESIDENT CLINTON TODAY 
WITH THE MISSISSIPPI FLOOD WATERS RISING BY THE HOUR AND CONFIRMED DEATH COUNT OF SIXTEEN THE MIDWEST MISERY INDEX IS RISING 
TODAY PRESIDENT CLINTON FROM JAPAN SAID HE'LL ASK CONGRESS FOR MORE FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDS 
RIGHT NOW NOT EVEN MONEY CAN DO MUCH FOR THE FOLKS OF IOWA 
C. N. N.'S BRIAN CABELL TELLS US WHY 
IOWA IS WAITING FOR THE WORST 
THE TOWN OF FOUR HUNDRED FORTY PEOPLE HAS BEEN EVACUATED BY ALL EXCEPT VOLUNTEERS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD 
A MAKESHIFT LEVEE ACROSS HIGHWAY NINETY NINE NEEDS CONSTANT REINFORCEMENT 
THE OVERFLOW FROM THE IOWA RIVER KEEPS RISING 
OUR PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE HAVING TO PULL MEN OFF THE LEVEE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED WHICH TENDS TO OFTEN MAKES DANGER A LOT 
MUCH OF THE CROP LAND GROWING SOYBEANS AND CORN IS ALREADY COVERED BY THROUGH THE LEVEES 
A MAJOR BREAK COULD SPELL DISASTER FOR THE TOWN 
I JUST FIGURED I'LL LOSE EVERYTHING 
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I DO 
NOTHING 
I MEAN I CAN'T GET BAG IT UP WHERE EVERYTHING'S SET UP 
WE HAVE NO FLOOD INSURANCE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCARED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE 
FIFTY MILES SOUTH THE TINY TOWN OF SHARES THE APPREHENSION 
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ALREADY THIRTEEN FEET ABOVE NORMAL HERE WILL OVERFLOW THE LEVEE WITH ONLY ABOUT TWO MORE FEET OF WATER 
IF THAT HAPPENS FOURTEEN THOUSAND CHOICE ACRES OF FARMLAND WOULD BE JEOPARDIZED 
FOR THE LAST EIGHT DAYS INMATES FROM A NEARBY STATE PENITENTIARY HAVE BEEN IN BY FILLING SANDBAGS TO BOLSTER THE LEVEES 
THE NATIONAL GUARD PATROLS THE RIVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WATCHING FOR WEAK POINTS IN THE LEVEE AND PREPARING FOR EVACUATION ALERTS 
BUT ALL THE PERSEVERANCE OF THESE PEOPLE ALL THEIR SANDBAGS CAN'T STOP NATURE 
IF THE MISSISSIPPI CONTINUES TO SWELL WITH RAINFALL IF IT CONTINUES TO EAT AWAY AT ITS BANKS IT WILL WIDEN AND RESIDENTS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE 
AND THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE DOESN'T HOLD MUCH PROMISE 
MORE RAIN IS LIKELY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS
