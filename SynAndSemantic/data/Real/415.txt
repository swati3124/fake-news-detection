DOCTORS ARE REPORTING A SAD DOWN SIDE TO THE MEDICAL REVOLUTION MANY PREMATURELY BORN BABIES ARE SURVIVING BUT SOME ARE DISABLED AND BLIND AND CANNOT WALK OR HAVE LEARNING PROBLEMS 
SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES ADVANCES IN MEDICINE HAVE SAVED MANY BABIES UNDER TWO POUNDS WHO WOULD HAVE DIED 
SOME WOULD BE MOTHERS MAY BE ENDANGERING THEIR HEALTH IN THEIR QUEST TO HAVE A CHILD 
NOW IN THIS STUDY INDICATES A POPULAR FERTILITY DRUG CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF OVARIAN TUMORS C. N. N.'S ANDREW HOLTZ HAS DETAILS 
DOCTOR ANA MURPHY IS EXAMINING DANA BARRY USING ULTRASOUND 
HERE'S YOUR UTERUS RIGHT THERE O. K. AND YOU CAN SEE THE STRIPE 
SHE IS LOOKING FOR SIGNS THAT HE DRUG IS PROMPTING OVULATION IN ORDER TO INCREASE DANA BARRY'S CHANCES OF BECOMING PREGNANT 
BUT ALSO KNOW AS OR MAY ALSO INCREASE RISKS OF DISEASE 
ACCORDING TO A STUDY THAT CONCLUDES INFERTILE WOMEN HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NORMAL RISK OF OVARIAN TUMORS 
INCLUDING BOTH CANCERS AND BENIGN GROWTHS 
WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE INCREASED RISKS OF OVARIAN TUMORS WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE OF WOMEN WHO HAD TAKEN THE DRUG AND WHO HAD TAKEN IT FOR A YEAR OR MORE 
YET EVEN IN THIS GROUP OF WOMEN OVARIAN TUMORS ARE UNCOMMON 
THE RESEARCHERS CALCULATE THAT DURING A TWELVE YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING TREATMENT RAISES THE RISK OF AN OVARIAN TUMOR FROM ABOUT ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED TO ABOUT ONE IN FIFTY 
FURTHERMORE MANY OF THE WOMEN WHO DEVELOP OVARIAN TUMORS A NUMBER OF THESE ARE NOT OF THE MOST SERIOUS FORM AND COULD BE CURED 
BASED ON EARLIER REPORTS DOCTORS HAD SUSPECTED DRUGS THAT STIMULATE THE MIGHT LEAD TO MORE TUMORS BUT THIS STUDY MORE CLEARLY DEFINES THE RISK OF LONG TERM USE 
I THINK THAT MOST OF US WILL EXAMINE MORE CAREFULLY OUR USE OF AND HOW MANY CYCLES THESE PATIENTS ARE ON 
SO YES I THINK THIS TO A LARGE EXTENT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF HOW WE THINK OF AS A DRUG 
YET WHICH IS USED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES A YEAR IN THE U. S. WILL LIKELY REMAIN POPULAR 
THE ALTERNATIVES TO ARE INJECTED DRUGS RATHER THAN PILLS 
THEY REQUIRE MORE INTENSIVE MONITORING AND CARE AND THEY COST MORE 
AND SWITCHING TREATMENTS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY ELIMINATE THE RISK OF OVARIAN TUMORS 
IT'S A RISK DANA BARRY IS WILLING TO ACCEPT 
I WILL STILL TAKE IT BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS I WON'T AND WITHOUT I WOULD NOT HAVE A BABY SO YOU KNOW THERE IS NOT VERY MANY CHOICES HERE 
AN EXPANDED STUDY IS ALREADY PLANNED IN ORDER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT LINKS BETWEEN FERTILITY TREATMENT AND OVARIAN TUMORS
