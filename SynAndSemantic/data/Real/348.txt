JUST WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN A LABEL ON A CHICKEN SAYS FRESH NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT SHOULD MEAN 
C. N. N.'S ELIZABETH SCHWARTZ REPORTS 
THAT'S NO BOWLING BALL THAT'S A FROZEN CHICKEN AND ONCE IT'S OUT IT CAN LEGALLY BE LABELED FRESH 
THAT'S A SURPRISE TO MANY CONSUMERS 
WITH THE WORD FRESH I ASSUME IT HASN'T BEEN FROZEN 
IF IT'S BEEN FROZEN THEN I THINK IT SHOULD SAY ON THERE THAT IT'S BEEN FROZEN 
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT THEY SAY IT'S FRESH WHEN IT HAS BEEN FROZEN 
IT'S A BURNING ISSUE PITTING CHICKEN COMPANY AGAINST CHICKEN COMPANY AND EVEN CALIFORNIA SENATOR DIANE FEINSTEIN AGAINST ARKANSAS SENATOR DALE BUMPERS 
FORMERLY FROZEN CHICKENS ARE CALLED FRESH WITH THE BLESSINGS OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
THE FEDERAL LAW WHICH WAS APPROVED BY A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION ALLOWS FOR A PRODUCT TO BE LABELED AS FRESH EVEN THOUGH IT'S FROZEN ROCK HARD 
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WILL IT'S A CONSUMER FRAUD OF MAJOR PROPORTIONS 
THE MAJOR CHICKEN PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T FREEZE THEIR CHICKENS 
TO MAKE THEIR POINT THEY DROP AND DROP AND BOWL WITH FROZEN BIRDS AND THE STATE PASSED A LAW SAYING NO CHICKENS COULD CALL THEMSELVES FRESH 
THE BIG COMPANIES IN THE SOUTHEAST LIKE TYSON AND DIDN'T LIKE THAT LAW 
THEY SOMETIMES FREEZE CHICKEN BEFORE SHIPPING EVEN THOUGH THE BIRDS COULD MAKE THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNFROZEN 
THEY SAY INDIVIDUAL STATE LAWS WOULD CREATE POULTRY PANDEMONIUM 
THAT WOULD BE CHAOS AND TERRIBLY DIFFICULT FOR INTERSTATE COMMERCE OF POULTRY 
A FEDERAL COURT AGREED AND NOW CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN ITS CASE TO THE U. S. D. A. WHERE THEY'RE UP AGAINST THE INFLUENTIAL NATIONAL POULTRY LOBBY 
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THEY'RE AS POWERFUL AS THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION 
WE THINK WE'RE A VERY EFFECTIVE GROUP 
POLITICS ASIDE IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE IN TASTE BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF CHICKEN 
IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK 
SOME WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU FREEZE AND THEN THAW CHICKEN THE MEAT ENDS UP BEING A LITTLE BIT DRIED OUT BUT OTHERS WOULD SAY IT TASTES JUST FINE 
ONE THING'S FOR SURE POULTRY COMPANIES GET MORE MONEY WHEN A CHICKEN SAYS FRESH MAKING THIS A GAME NO ONE WANTS TO LOSE
