DOCTORS HAVE SPENT YEARS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL LEARNING ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY AND HOW TO TREAT ITS ILLS 
SOME MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE GETTING SCHOOLED IN THE HUMANITIES AS WELL 
THE GOAL BETTER BEDSIDE MANNER 
C. N. N.'S AL HINMAN HAS THE STORY IN THIS NEWS FROM MEDICINE 
TOMORROW'S DOCTORS LEARN ON THE RUN ON DAILY TEACHING ROUNDS 
BRAND NEW DOCTORS BRIEF MEDICAL STUDENTS UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THEIR PHYSICIAN TEACHERS AT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN COLUMBIA SOUTH CAROLINA 
THE POINT IS IS THAT STROKE IS A PREVENTABLE ILLNESS 
THERE'S MORE THAN THE SCIENCE OF HEALING BEING TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA'S SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TO COMMENT ON THE CONTRAST BETWEEN LIBERTY AND EQUALITY 
DOCTORS AND DOCTORS IN TRAINING STUDY THE HUMANITIES HERE WITH A SIGN READING FROM PLATO TO SHAKESPEARE TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION 
THERE'S TRUTHS IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE VERY VALUABLE TRUTH YET DIFFERENT KIND OF TRUTH THAN A SCIENTIFIC TRUTH 
DOCTOR DONALD SAUNDERS BELIEVES THE GREAT IDEAS OF THE PAST AND PRESENT CAN HELP PRODUCE BETTER DOCTORS 
ETHICS IS ABOUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WHAT SHOULD BE DONE 
IT'S THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
WHAT IS THE GOOD THAT WE SHOULD SEEK 
THAT'S WHAT ETHICS AND MORAL BEHAVIOR IS ABOUT 
DOCTOR SAUNDERS CANDIDLY TELLS HIS ETHICS CLASSES HE FEELS MANY PHYSICIANS HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THE HUMANITY IN MEDICINE 
REALLY HIS MEDICAL PROBLEMS I THINK ARE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
AGAIN HE'S NOT REALLY A DIAGNOSTIC PROBLEM 
RECENT AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION POLLS SHOW A SLIPPAGE IN THE PUBLIC TRUST OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION ONE REASON MORE MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE MAKING ETHICS TRAINING MANDATORY 
THERE'S MORE AND MORE EFFORT THAT'S BEING MADE TO YOU KNOW DON'T BE A REAL HARD CASE 
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS YOU NEED TO LOOK AT 
THIS IS A PERSON 
IT'S NOT A YOU KNOW HEART ATTACK THAT GOT YOU UP AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND IF SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T BEEN TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES 
THIS IS A PERSON THAT HAS PROBLEMS 
THE GOAL OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA ETHICS TRAINING IS TO CREATE A NEW VERSION OF THE WARM AND CARING OLD FAMILY DOCTOR 
THE BEST DOCTOR WILL BE A GOOD FRIEND AND A GOOD FRIEND IS GOING TO BE MOVED WHEN YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM 
A GOOD FRIEND IS ALSO GOING TO BE THERE TO HELP YOU GET THROUGH IT 
THE MOVE TO TRAIN KINDER DOCTORS COMES AS MEDICINE GROWS INCREASINGLY MORE HIGH TECH 
BUT WITH ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY DOCTORS ARE FINDING IT EVEN TOUGHER AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THEY SAY TO MAINTAIN A CLOSE CARING RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL THEIR PATIENTS
