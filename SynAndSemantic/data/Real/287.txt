THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION PARTICULARLY THE FIRST LADY SPENT MUCH OF THE YEAR CRAFTING HEALTH CARE REFORMS 
THE GOAL 
PROVIDE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS THOSE WORKING AND THOSE NOT 
A LOOK AT THE PROGNOSIS FOR REFORM IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR FROM C. N. N.'S SENIOR CORRESPONDENT CHARLES BIERBAUER 
IF ONLY HEALTH CARE REFORM WERE THIS SIMPLE 
MY CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S WISH FOR AMERICA IS THAT EVERY AMERICAN BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR CAN LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE SAME KIND OF SYSTEM THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE TODAY 
IT'S CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT IN THE YEAR AHEAD WHO WILL HAVE TO RECONCILE THEIR DIFFERENCES ON WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE GUARANTEES AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE AND CAN AFFORD 
PREDICTIONS 
IT WILL HAPPEN 
WILL IT BE EASY 
NUMBER 
COULD IT NOT HAPPEN 
OH SURE 
THINGS CAN GO WRONG 
YOU COULD GET A DEADLOCK BUT I THINK THERE'S A SPIRIT ON BOTH SIDES 
THERE IS ALSO PLENTY OF COMPETITION FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM BOTH SIDES 
THERE ARE DEMOCRATS WHO THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS CREATED AN UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX SYSTEM 
WE CALL OUR PROPOSAL CLINTON LIGHT BECAUSE IT TASTES GREAT AND IT LESS FILLING 
WE ACHIEVE THE PRESIDENT'S GOALS BUT WITH LESS COST AND LESS BUREAUCRACY 
AND REPUBLICANS WHO THINK IT'S TOO MUCH BIG GOVERNMENT 
I THINK WE'LL HAVE SEVERAL MAJOR MAJOR PHILOSOPHICAL BATTLES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION 
POLITICAL ARE ALREADY BUZZING 
I DESCRIBED IT THE OTHER DAY AS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE SOONER OR LATER 
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY GET IT TO IT THE FIRST WEEK ALTHOUGH YOU CLEARLY HAVE A NATIONAL HEALTH BOARD AND A NATIONAL HEALTH BUREAUCRACY 
THE PRESIDENT GINGRICH'S CHARGE BY SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH SUPPORTIVE DOCTORS 
I WOULD HOPE WE'LL ALL GET A LAUGH WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS EMINENT PANEL OF SOCIALISTS UP HERE ON THE PLATFORM 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ANSWER 
I DON'T THINK WHAT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE 
I THINK IT'S EXPENSIVE MEDICINE 
MONEY IS REALLY THE ROOT OF THE DEBATE 
HEALTH CARE NOW ACCOUNTS FOR ONE DOLLAR IN EVERY SEVEN AMERICANS SPEND 
THE INCLUDE HOW MUCH THE PRESIDENT'S AMBITIOUS MENU OF BENEFITS COULD COST OR SAVE HOW MUCH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID CAN REALISTICALLY AND POLITICALLY BE TRIMMED HOW BIG A HEALTH CARE BURDEN BUSINESS CAN STAND HOW DEEPLY INDIVIDUALS SHOULD DIG INTO THEIR POCKETS 
BUT THE NUMBERS ADD UP THE NUMBERS ARE FINE THE NUMBERS WILL WORK THE NUMBERS ARE VERY BIG 
HEALTH CARE IS VERY EXPENSIVE 
THIS IS GOING TO WORK 
CONGRESS WILL HAVE OPTIONS 
DEMOCRAT COOPER WOULD SLOW THE PACE TOWARD THE PRESIDENT'S DEMAND FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
IS NOT LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH 
YOU JUST DON'T TURN IT ON OR OFF 
IT'S MORE LIKE A DIMMER SWITCH 
AND OUR BILL IS EIGHTY PERCENT BRIGHT WITHOUT BLOWING ANY FUSES 
WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
AND THEN IN A COUPLE YEARS WE CAN GET ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BRIGHT WITHOUT BLOWING ANY FUSES 
REPUBLICAN NICKLES LIKE CLINTON WOULD MANDATE COVERAGE BUT ONLY FOR THE MOST COSTLY CARE 
SO IF WE HAD EVERYBODY HAVE AT LEAST CATASTROPHIC THAT WOULD COVER THE BIG EXPENSES 
THAT WOULD COVER THE MAJOR EXPENSES IN HOSPITALS AND WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE COST SHIFTING 
REPUBLICAN CHAFEE WOULD SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY 
UNDER OUR LEGISLATION WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FINALLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL 
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AS YOU KNOW REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER EIGHTY PERCENT UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE HEALTH PREMIUM COST 
WE FEEL THIS IS VERY VERY SEVERE ON SMALL BUSINESS 
THE CLINTONS WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS A PUBLIC ISSUE IN THE HOPE OF RETAINING AS MUCH OF THEIR PLAN AS POSSIBLE BUT MOST OF THE WORK NOW WILL BE DONE ON CAPITOL HILL MUCH OF IT AWAY FROM THE FORMAL COMMITTEE ROOMS 
WE MEET EVERY WEEK 
I STARTED THIS 
WE MEET IN MY OFFICE 
THE AGENDA IS THERE IT'S VERY RELAXED VERY CASUAL COKE AND COOKIES BUT WE TALK TO EACH OTHER 
SENATOR ROCKEFELLER THINKS NEITHER THE DEMOCRATS NOR THE REPUBLICANS CAN PASS HEALTH CARE ON THEIR OWN 
THEY'LL NEED EACH OTHER 
THEIR DIFFERENCES WILL HAVE TO BE IRONED OUT OVER THE NEXT SIX EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS BUT THE MANDATE IS REALLY NOW FOR CONGRESS TO SHOW THAT IT CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT HEALTH CARE
