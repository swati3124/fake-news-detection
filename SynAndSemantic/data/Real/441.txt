IF YOU'RE NOT A COUCH POTATO YET THE NETWORKS ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOU BECOME ONE 
PRIME TIME THIS FALL HAS A NEW LOOK THAT'S DESIGNED TO KEEP YOU IN YOUR SEAT 
C. N. N.'S SHERRIE SYLVESTER LOOKS AT SOME OF THE NEW GIMMICKS 
DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL 
IT USED TO BE A REQUEST 
NOW THE NETWORKS ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO THE REMOTE CONTROL AND ELIMINATE THE BATHROOM BREAK 
WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS BETWEEN A FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DIP FROM THE TIME THE CREDITS STARTED TO THE TIME THE NEW SHOW BEGAN AND WE SAID WELL MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO GO FROM ONE SHOW TO THE OTHER AND AVOID THAT ZAPPING OPPORTUNITY 
THE PEACOCK PLAN NAMED 'N. B. C. TWO THOUSAND CALLS FOR SPLITTING THE SCREEN BETWEEN THE CREDITS AND THE SHOW 
A STAFF HAS BEEN HIRED TO MAKE THE ENDINGS ENTERTAINING 
THE NEXT SERIES BEGINS WITHOUT A COMMERCIAL BREAK 
AT A. B. C. THE THEME SONG FACES CANCELLATION 
WE'VE OFFERED ALL SHOWS ALL RETURNING SHOWS TO ELIMINATE THEIR MAIN TITLES AND HAVE COME AS CLOSE AS WE CAN TO MANDATING AND ORDERING WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT BUT WE TAKE A STAB NEW SHOWS TO HAVE NO MAIN TITLE 
RETURNING SHOWS SUCH AS HOME IMPROVEMENT ROSEANNE AND COACH HAVE CHOSEN TO KEEP THEIR OPENS 
I USED TO LOVE MARY TYLER MOORE'S GRAPHICS AND BOB NEWHART TO OPEN THE SHOW 
THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL THE MUSIC YOU GET THAT THING 
I THINK THAT ATTRACTS YOU 
MY ARGUMENT WITH A. B. C. WAS THAT OUR MUSIC IF YOU'RE IN ANOTHER ROOM THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW 
C. B. S. AND FOX HAVE ALSO CUT BACK ON SHOW OPENS HOPING TO CARRY THE VIEWERS STRAIGHT THROUGH PRIME TIME 
REVIEWS ARE MIXED 
I DOUBT THAT'S GOING TO FOOL ANYBODY INTO STAYING WITH SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO WATCH 
AT LEAST THEY CAN DO IN MY OPINION TO GIVE US MORE TIME ON CAMERA AND GET OUR STORY TOLD I THINK IS A GOOD MOVE 
WHEN WE ELIMINATED OUR MINUTE LONG TITLE SEQUENCE OUR SHARE POINTS WENT UP IMMEDIATELY TWO POINTS 
AND I ALSO I THINK THERE'S AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE 
THEY WANT TO SLIDE ANOTHER COMMERCIAL IN THERE TOO YOU KNOW 
THE COMMERCIALS BETWEEN SHOWS ARE NOT COMPLETELY GONE JUST ADDED TO ANOTHER BREAK 
ALL THE NEW MOVES HAVE GOTTEN VIEWERS TO TRY NEW SHOWS 
THEY CAN STILL TURN AWAY AND THEY CAN DO THAT IN A MINUTE OR TWO 
BUT WHAT WE ARE WE'RE AT LEAST DRIVING THEM INTO THE NEW SHOWS 
WHEN I WAS LITTLE WE HAD THREE CHANNELS IN BLACK AND WHITE AND YOU HAD TO GET UP AND CHANGE IT 
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS JUST TOO BUSY NOW 
THESE DAYS THE ONLY WAY VIEWERS SEE THE KITCHEN IN PRIME TIME IS ON THE SCREEN
