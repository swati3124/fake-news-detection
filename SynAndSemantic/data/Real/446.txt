NOW FROM A. B. C. NEWS TWENTY TWENTY THS CONTINUES 
ONCE AGAIN BARBARA WALTERS 
WHO REALLY DID KNOW NICOLE AND O. J. SIMPSON 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE MADE THAT CLAIM SINCE THE MURDERS NEARLY FOUR MONTHS AGO BUT TONIGHT WE BRING YOU THREE PEOPLE WHO BY EVERYONE'S MEASURE WERE REALLY INSIDERS 
THEY WILL GIVE YOU AN INTIMATE VIEW OF BOTH NICOLE AND O. J. SIMPSON INCLUDING A STARTLING REVELATION THAT COULD POSSIBLY SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE CASE 
NOW MEET NICOLE SIMPSON'S CLOSEST FRIENDS 
CHRIS JENNER NOW THE WIFE OF OLYMPIC ATHLETE BRUCE JENNER HAD KNOWN NICOLE SIMPSON SINCE THEY WERE TEENAGERS TOGETHER 
RON HARDY WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO NICOLE BY CHRIS CAME TO CONSIDER NICOLE AS A SISTER 
THEY WERE BOTH PART OF NICOLE'S INNER CIRCLE OF CLOSE FRIENDS 
IT WAS RON HARDY TO WHOM NICOLE'S FAMILY TURNED WHEN IT CAME TIME TO CLEAN OUT HER TOWNHOUSE AFTER THE MURDER 
POLICE HAD SAID THAT WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVED AT THE SCENE THERE WAS MUSIC ON THE STEREO AND CANDLES IN THE LIVING ROOM 
WHEN YOU CAME TO NICOLE'S HOUSE TWO DAYS LATER AFTER THE CRIME THOSE CANDLES WERE STILL BURNING 
RIGHT 
RIGHT OR ONE OF THEM WAS I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF THEM 
THE STORY IS THAT NICOLE LIT CANDLES IN HER LIVING ROOM WHEN SHE WAS EXPECTING A BOYFRIEND 
IS THAT SO 
YEAH 
I THINK NICOLE LIT CANDLES A LOT IN HER HOUSE 
SHE LOVED CANDLES AND WHEN SHE WAS EXPECTING COMPANY SHE WOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS AND TURN ON THE MUSIC AND LIGHT THE CANDLES 
AND THAT WAS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT OF THE WAY NICOLE WOULD TREAT ANY OF US 
SO IT WOULD MEAN SHE WAS EXPECTING A FRIEND OR SOMEONE THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE IT 
NICE 
NICE 
PRETTY 
RIGHT BUT NOT THAT SHE WAS NECESSARILY GOING TO HAVE A ROMANCE 
NUMBER 
NUMBER 
NICOLE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE 
NICOLE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
NICOLE HAD A GORGEOUS BODY 
SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL FACE AND WE ALL HATED HER 
NO SHE WAS 
NOT A TINY GIRL 
NICOLE WAS ABOUT FIVE SEVEN 
SHE WEIGHED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POUNDS AND SHE WAS A BIG GIRL 
SHE WORE MY COATS I THINK 
SHE HAD BIG SHOULDERS 
YEAH YEAH 
SHE WAS A BIG GIRL 
THE PICTURE THAT ONE GETS OF NICOLE IS THAT SHE WAS SO VERY MUCH UNDER O. J.'S WHAT POWER DIRECTION 
DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP AS YOU SAW IT 
NICOLE AND O. J. HAD A VERY UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP IN THAT WHEN NICOLE WAS MARRIED TO O. J. THERE WAS NO BETTER WIFE 
SHE WAS A GREAT WIFE SHE WAS A GREAT MOM 
I THINK O. J. CONTROLLED NICOLE AND DURING THAT TIME I REALIZED THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH NICOLE AND DURING THAT WHOLE TIME HOW CONTROLLED SHE REALLY WAS 
WAS SHE NERVOUS 
SHE WAS NERVOUS 
I REMEMBER FOR YEARS NICOLE WOULD BITE HER FINGERNAILS SO BADLY THAT THEY WOULD BLEED 
THEY WERE BITTEN ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE QUICK 
THAT SEEMS LIKE A SILLY THING BUT THOSE WERE HER NERVES YOU KNOW 
SHE WOULD JUST CHEW AT HER NAILS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WHAT SHE WAS GOING THROUGH WHATEVER THAT WAS TO ANYBODY 
WE KEEP HEARING THE WORD OBSESSIVE THAT HE WAS OBSESSIVE 
YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEADS 
GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES 
I MEAN I THINK O. J. REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHERE SHE WAS ALL THE TIME ESPECIALLY SHE WASN'T LIVING AT THE HOUSE WITH HIM ANYMORE 
SO WE WENT ON A VACATION TOGETHER A BUNCH OF US AND WE WERE IN MEXICO WE WERE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY 
AND HE WOULD HE WAS ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY CALLING HER 
WAS O. J. JEALOUS 
O. J. WAS JEALOUS 
O. J. WAS JEALOUS OF THE PEOPLE THAT SHE WOULD ASSOCIATE HERSELF WITH IF THEY WERE MALE 
IT TOOK HIM A WHILE TO GET USED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NOW DATING AND SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO GO OUT AND DATE 
SHE WAS DIVORCED 
THEY HAD A VERY PASSIONATE RELATIONSHIP SO TO DISCONNECT FROM THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT O. J. SIMPSON 
I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS WITH BOTH O. J. AND NICOLE FOR SO MANY YEARS I'M NOT ONLY SADDENED AND GRIEVING FOR MY GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BUT FOR A VERY TROUBLED MAN AND I'M VERY CONFUSED 
DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM 
NUMBER 
ANOTHER CLOSE FRIEND OF NICOLE SIMPSON WAS CORA FISHMAN HER REGULAR RUNNING MATE AND CONFIDANTE 
WE TALKED TO EACH OTHER 
THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE TALKED EVERY DAY 
IN FACT I STILL DO MISS HER EIGHT O'CLOCK CALL THE NINE O'CLOCK CALL 
I MEAN WE TALKED TO EACH OTHER FOR LIKE THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY 
REALLY 
YES 
AND THEN YOU WENT RUNNING EVERY DAY 
BASICALLY EVERY DAY 
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT ON THOSE TEN MILE RUNS 
WELL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RUN TEN MILES IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TALK 'CAUSE YOU'RE HUFFING AND PUFFING 
WE TALKED ABOUT OUR LIVES 
SHE ALWAYS WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE ALWAYS HAD WANTED TO BE HOW O. J. COULD JUST CHANGE HOW O. J. COULD JUST STOP WOMANIZING 
SHE KNEW OF THE RUMORS THAT O. J. HAD OTHER WOMEN WHILE THEY WERE MARRIED 
YES SHE KNEW THAT 
AND SHE COULD LIVE WITH THAT 
WELL SHE DID I THINK 
YOU KNOW WHY 
BECAUSE SHE LOVED O. J. SO MUCH TO A POINT WHERE SHE WAS ABLE TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR YEARS 
I THINK IT WAS PART OF DENIAL 
SHE KNEW IT BUT SHE BECAUSE SHE LOVED HIM SHE AND SHE HAD KIDS 
SO FOR HER SHE JUST WANTED TO HAVE A FAMILY 
DID NICOLE HAVE WHILE SHE WAS MARRIED 
NUMBER 
SHE WAS A DEVOTED WIFE TO O. J. 
THE FAMOUS NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN PHONE CALL WHEN THE NICOLE SAID THAT O. J. WAS TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR AND THREATENING HER 
FIRST OF ALL HE BROKE THE BACK DOOR DOWN TO GET IN THE DOOR 
OKAY WAIT A MINUTE 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
NICOLE SIMPSON 
THIS CALL WAS MADE FROM NICOLE'S RENTED HOUSE IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
ALMOST FIVE YEARS EARLIER WHEN THEY WERE STILL MARRIED NICOLE HAD CALLED POLICE TO COMPLAINT THE O. J. HAD BEATEN HER IN THEIR FAMILY HOME 
THE INCIDENT LAST YEAR DID NOT RESULT IN AN INJURY 
DID SHE TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT 
SHE TOLD ME THE FOLLOWING DAY THAT O. J. WENT NUTS AGAIN 
SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT O. J. STARTED SCREAMING AND YELLING BECAUSE OF THAT PICTURE OF KEITH 
KEITH WAS KEITH WHO DATED NICOLE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS 
IRONICALLY HE WORKED FOR THE OWNERS OF THE MEZZALUNA RESTAURANT WHERE NICOLE DINED THE NIGHT OF HER MURDER 
SAYS THAT O. J. SIMPSON SPIED ON NICOLE'S LIVING ROOM ONE NIGHT IN APRIL OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO AS KEITH AND NICOLE MADE LOVE 
O. J. CONFRONTED THEM HE SAID THE NEXT DAY 
ACCORDING TO CORA O. J. TOLD HER ABOUT IT 
O. J. TOLD ME I HEARD IT ALL BUT I DON'T KNOW 
I HAVE NO CONFIRMATION OF THAT 
THAT WAS JUST IN PASSING THAT O. J. TOLD ME AND NICOLE TOLD ME THAT O. J. KNEW ABOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP 
O. J. USED TO CALL YOU ALL THE TIME 
YES 
AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT NICOLE 
YES 
LIKE WHAT 
WHAT'S NICOLE THINKING AGAIN 
WHAT IS SHE UP TO 
THERE WERE REPORTS OF A YOUNG MAN AN ACTOR NAMED JOSEPH WHO HAD BEEN SEEING NICOLE 
WHAT WAS THAT 
SHE DID CARE ABOUT JOSEPH PARTLY BECAUSE JOSEPH WAS A VERY MELLOW GUY 
HE WAS VERY CALM THE EXACT OPPOSITE I GUESS OF O. J.'S BEHAVIOR YOU KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN O. J. HEARD ABOUT JOSEPH 
WELL HE GOT UPSET BUT THERE WAS NOTHING HE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
CORA THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT O. J. WAS STALKING NICOLE SPYING ON HER 
YES 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS 
HE DID FOLLOW US BUT HE SAID IT WAS JUST COINCIDENCE YOU KNOW THAT IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT HE WAS THERE AT A PLACE WHERE WE WERE 
WAS NICOLE AFRAID OF O. J. 
SHE WAS VERY FEARFUL OF O. J. I GUESS BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHEN SHE WAS HIT BY O. J. 
SHE WAS AFRAID O. J. MIGHT BEAT HER UP AGAIN OR HIT HER AGAIN 
YES 
RIGHT 
DID SHE EVER EXPRESS FEAR FOR HER LIFE 
WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT 
I GUESS SHE JUST MENTIONED OH I'M SO SCARED OF O. J. I'M SO SCARED OF O. J. BUT THAT'S HOW FAR OUR CONVERSATION WAS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE HER DECIDE FINALLY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LEAVE O. J. 
WHEN SHE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT 
I'M GETTING OLD 
I NEED A STRESS FREE LIFE 
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE 
I WANT TO BE MYSELF AND NOT BE WITH A MAN WHO IS ALWAYS TELLING ME WHAT TO DO 
NICOLE WAS THIRTY FIVE 
YES 
WAS SHE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING OLD 
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT 
WE TALKED ABOUT GEE ONE OF THESE DAYS WE'LL HAVE WRINKLES HERE WRINKLES THERE SO YES SHE WAS AFRAID OF GETTING OLD 
NICOLE SEEMED TO PREFER YOUNGER MEN 
SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO YOUNGER MEN 
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY WHO'S THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD HAD TWO KIDS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD GUYS LOOK AT YOU YOU FEEL GOOD 
AND I THINK SHE'S ALSO RELIVING HER YOUTH 
SHE WAS GOING THROUGH A PHASE IN HER LIFE YOU KNOW 
IN WHAT WAS CONSIDERED A SUICIDE NOTE FROM O. J. HE SAID THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE FELT LIKE AN ABUSED HUSBAND 
DID YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
WELL NICOLE SAID YOU'RE OLD 
THERE ARE TIMES SHE'D SAY TO HIM 
YES THAT YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR ME 
SO IT MADE HIM FEEL YOU THINK ABUSED IN HIS WAY 
YEAH RIGHT 
YES 
AND ONE DAY NICOLE WELL THIS IS WHAT O. J. TOLD ME HOW ONE DAY SHE WANTS ME IN THE RELATIONSHIP ONE DAY SHE DOESN'T WANT ME IN THAT AND SO O. J. SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO 
LIKE A YO YO 
YEAH RIGHT 
THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE SIMPSON STORY IS THE CLAIM OF LESBIAN RELATIONSHIP 
IN A BOOK TO BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY A WOMAN NAMED FAY RESNICK SAYS THAT SHE AND NICOLE SIMPSON WERE INTIMATE 
RESNICK WAS KNOWN AS A CLOSE FRIEND OF NICOLE'S TOWARD THE END OF NICOLE'S LIFE 
CORA THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE BUT NICOLE TOLD A FRIEND ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH FAY RESNICK 
YOU WERE THAT FRIEND YES 
WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF IT 
I'M VERY VERY UPSET ABOUT WHAT FAY HAD DONE 
WRITING THIS BOOK 
WRITING THIS BOOK 
I FELT LIKE SHE USED NICOLE SHE SEDUCED NICOLE FOR THIS 
NICOLE IS SO VULNERABLE SHE WAS VULNERABLE AND BASICALLY SHE WAS ACTING LIKE A TWENTY YEAR OLD WOMAN 
EXPERIMENTING 
SHE'S EXPERIMENTING STUFF AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS SOMETHING SHE'S NOT A LESBIAN 
SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED MEN SO I DON'T KNOW WHY FAY EVEN WROTE ABOUT THIS 
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF THIS 
FAY 
FAY 
CORA DID FAY RESNICK SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN NICOLE'S HOUSE DURING THE LAST WEEKS OF NICOLE'S LIFE 
YES 
FAY HAS BEEN SLEEPING THERE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT 
FAY RESNICK IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED DRUG USER 
SHE USED COCAINE 
SHE WAS IN A REHAB CENTER 
SEVERAL TIMES 
AT THE TIME OF NICOLE'S MURDER 
YES 
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE DID NICOLE USE DRUGS 
NO NOT THAT I KNOW OF 
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER DO DRUGS OR COCAINE 
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE DID O. J. SIMPSON USE DRUGS 
THAT I DON'T KNOW 
NICOLE NEVER TOLD ME SO 
SHE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT 
NUMBER 
HAVING A FRIEND WITH A DRUG PROBLEM WHO KNOWS WHAT CIRCLE THAT IS 
IS THIS ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO NICOLE'S DEATH 
YOU KNOW BARBARA I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
I SAID IF THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH DRUGS BUT NOBODY WOULD EVEN WHO WOULD HURT NICOLE 
SHE WAS NOT EVEN INVOLVED WITH DRUGS 
FAY WAS 
DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR LAST CONVERSATION WITH NICOLE AND WHEN IT WAS 
MY LAST CONVERSATION WITH NICOLE WAS THE DAY WE RAN 
SHE SAID TO ME SHE WAS ACTUALLY SHE WAS VERY HAPPY AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT CORA 
I FEEL SO FREE NOW 
I FEEL LIKE I COULD DO ANYTHING I WANT 
I'M NOT AFRAID OF HIM ANYMORE 
WHEN WAS THIS 
THIS WAS A FRIDAY 
AND ON MONDAY SHE WAS GONE 
YEAH 
NOW YOUR OPINION 
DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT WE JUST HEARD THESE PEOPLE SAY TO YOU IS GOING TO BE OF HELP TO THE DEFENSE OR THE PROSECUTION 
IT COULD BE EITHER 
FOR EXAMPLE THE DEFENSE MIGHT BE PLEASED BECAUSE CORA OFFERS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE THEORY THAT IS A DRUG CONNECTION WHICH COULD RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF DRUG RELATED VIOLENCE 
YOU KNOW IT COULD CAST A DOUBT ON THE GUILT OF O. J. AND ANYTHING THAT CASTS A DOUBT ON THAT GUILT IS GOOD FOR THE DEFENSE 
ON THE OTHER HAND THE PROSECUTION COULD BE PLEASED BECAUSE THE INTERVIEW PROVIDES AN OPEN WINDOW TO THE INTENSITY AND THE FEAR IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN O. J. AND NICOLE 
IT COULD WORK EITHER WAY 
NOW SINCE THESE PEOPLE WERE FRIENDLY WITH O. J. 
YES 
AS WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT THE OTHERS ASIDE FROM CHRIS JENNER FELT ABOUT HIM OR FEEL ABOUT HIM NOW 
I THINK THEY ALL FEEL SOMEWHAT THE SAME WAY THAT IS THEY WISH THAT THERE WERE ANOTHER SUSPECT ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHILDREN 
YOU KNOW THE CHILDREN WERE VERY CLOSE AND PLAYED TOGETHER CHILDREN NICOLE'S CHILDREN 
THERE IS NOT NOW ANOTHER SUSPECT BUT I THINK THEY WOULD BE VERY RELIEVED IF THERE WERE 
AND THEY SEE IT KEENLY AS A MASSIVE TRAGEDY ALL THE WAY AROUND 
THANK YOU BARBARA 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 
NOW AND JUST IN TIME OF THE WEEKEND IMPORTANT MEDICAL NEWS ABOUT DRINKING AND YOUR HEART 
A COUPLE OF DRINKS A DAY CAN REDUCE YOUR RISK OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE BY AS MUCH AS FORTY PERCENT 
THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF A NEW SCIENTIFIC STUDY FROM BRITAIN THE SECOND STUDY IN A WEEK TO TOUT THE BENEFITS OF MODERATE DRINKING 
THE BRITISH STUDY TO BE RELEASED THIS WEEKEND IS THE LONGEST ONE EVER DONE ON THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON HEALTH 
THESE DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE TWELVE THOUSAND TRACKED OVER A THIRTEEN YEAR PERIOD AND THEY FOUND FEWER DEATHS AMONG THE DOCTORS WHO DRANK ONE TO THREE DRINKS A DAY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO HAD MORE THAN THAT OR WHO DIDN'T DRINK AT ALL 
AND THE RESEARCHERS SAID WINE AND HARD LIQUOR ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE 
JUST LAST WEEK A MUCH SMALLER STUDY FROM BOSTON REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION AND IN THAT ONE THE RESEARCHERS SAID MODERATE DRINKING REDUCES HEART DISEASE BY KEEPING ARTERIES 
RESEARCHERS WARN HOWEVER THAT MORE IS NOT BETTER 
HEAVY DRINKERS THAT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIX TO TEN DRINKS A DAY ACTUALLY INCREASE THEIR RISK OF DEATH 
THAT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US 
BY THE WAY BOTH STUDIES FOCUSED ON MEN BUT THE RESEARCHERS SAY THE FINDINGS PROBABLY APPLY TO WOMEN AS WELL 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
