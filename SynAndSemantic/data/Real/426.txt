NOW CHECKING SOME POLITICAL NEWS IN THE UNITED STATES REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS WENT TO CAPITOL HILL TODAY AND MADE A CAMPAIGN PROMISE 
BUT AS C. N. N.'S BOB FRANKEN REPORTS THEY SAY THEY WILL KEEP THE PROMISE ONLY IF THE G. O. P. WINS A MAJORITY OF SEATS IN THE HOUSE IN THE FALL ELECTIONS 
IT WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL PHOTO OPS THREE HUNDRED REPUBLICAN HOUSE CANDIDATES SIGNING WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR CONTRACT WITH AMERICA 
TODAY IS THE DAY WE AS REPUBLICANS MAKE OUR COMPACT WITH THE PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THEIR HOUSE AND RESTORE FAITH IN THE INSTITUTION OF THE CONGRESS 
IT'S A TEN POINT PROMISE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY'LL KEEP IF THEY TAKE OVER THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NO LONGER CONSIDERED UNTHINKABLE GIVEN THE WAY VOTERS FEEL 
I FEEL THAT THE REPUBLICANS DO A BETTER JOB OF MANAGING THE COUNTRY THAN THE DEMOCRATS DO 
POLLS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THE NATION HOLDS THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED CONGRESS IN VIRTUAL CONTEMPT 
THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS CALL AN OPPORTUNITY 
ONE OF THE P. R. PEOPLE CALLED THE HERD OF T. V. CAMERAS THE PRETTIEST PICTURE OF ALL 
THEY WERE SHOOTING A MEGA STAGED EVENT 
THE CONTRACT PLEDGES THAT IN A REPUBLICAN HOUSE THERE WILL BE VOTES WITHIN A HUNDRED DAYS ON TERM LIMITS WELFARE REFORM NEW ANTI CRIME LEGISLATION AND A SLEW OF FAMILIAR ECONOMIC PROPOSALS A VARIETY OF TAX CUTS INCLUDING OF COURSE CAPITAL GAINS 
THERE'S THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT AND CONGRESSIONAL REFORM 
THIS REPUBLICAN RALLY HAD DEMOCRATIC INFILTRATORS MOST IN TUXEDOS A SYMBOL THEY SAID OF G. O. P. SPECIAL INTEREST INFLUENCE 
AND IN CASE ANYONE MISSED THE POINT THEY ALSO SENT IN A FAT CAT 
AND IN CASE ANYONE STILL MISSED THEIR POINT 
TODAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR WARMED OVER STEW AND MORE TRICKLE DOWN 
AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE THIS WAS A RALLY FOR CONGRESSMAN NEWT GINGRICH FORMER PARTISAN BOMB THROWER POSSIBLE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
TODAY ON THESE STEPS WE ARE FOR THIS CONTRACT AS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS RENEWING AMERICAN CIVILIZATION 
PEOPLE DON'T THINK INDEPENDENTLY THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN SPECIAL INTERESTS BEING REELECTED 
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT 
WHILE GIVEN THE CONGRESSIONAL THESE DAYS BEFORE YOU CAN JUDGE THE SUCCESS OF THIS EVENT YOU'LL HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE CANDIDATES ARE HELPED OR HURT BEING SO NEAR TO THE CAPITOL 
BERNIE 
BOB DO THE REPUBLICANS SAY IF THEY DO NOT TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE THEY WILL WORK WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON PROBLEMS THE AMERICAN VOTERS CARE MOST ABOUT 
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THE REPUBLICANS SAY VERY MUCH THESE DAYS 
THEY'VE BEEN QUITE CONFRONTATIONAL PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE 
IN FACT THE REPUBLICANS SAY IF THEY DON'T NUMERICALLY TAKE OVER THE HOUSE BUT COME CLOSE THEY MAY STRIKE SOME DEALS WITH CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS TO TAKE ON THE DEMOCRATS ANYWAY 
THANK YOU
