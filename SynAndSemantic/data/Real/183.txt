SEVEN BOATS WITH SOME ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CHINESE NATIONALS REMAIN IN UNCERTAIN WATERS OFF THE PACIFIC COAST OF MEXICO TODAY 
LATE LAST NIGHT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TURNED DOWN A U. S. REQUEST TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE OF THE REFUGEES 
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WANTS THE U. N. TO PROCESS THE ASYLUM REQUESTS IN MEXICO 
THE B. B. C.'S CHARLES HAS THIS REPORT FROM MEXICO CITY 
WASHINGTON HAD HOPED THAT MEXICO WOULD TAKE THIS LATEST PROBLEM WITH CHINESE BOAT PEOPLE OFF ITS HANDS 
THEY WOULD HAVE FAR LESS CHANCE OF BEING GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM IN MEXICO THAN IN THE UNITED STATES BUT THE MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID IT WAS IN NO POSITION TO ACCEDE TO THE AMERICAN REQUEST 
THEY GATHERED HOWEVER THAT IF THE SHIPS DID ENTER MEXICAN TERRITORIAL WATERS IT WOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE ACTION 
THREE OF THE SHIPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN BOARDED BY THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD BUT THE OTHER FOUR ARE BELIEVED TO BE STILL IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS 
A MEXICAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAID NAVY SHIPS WERE PATROLLING THE COAST IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT THE APPROACHING 
HE SAID THAT THE CHINESE MIGRANTS HAD PAID ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH FOR THE PASSAGE 
THE OFFICIAL SAID MEXICO WOULD COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA IN INVESTIGATING THE INTERNATIONAL GANGS THAT SMUGGLE THE CHINESE INTO NORTH AMERICA 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE THOUGHT TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES EACH YEAR AND A POPULAR ROUTE IS THROUGH MEXICO 
IN A RECENT INCIDENT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED CHINESE IMMIGRANTS ESCAPED FROM CUSTODY IN MEXICO AND CROSSED THE BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES 
THE MEXICANS PUT THE REMAINING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MIGRANTS ON A FLIGHT TO PEKING 
ONLY ONE MEMBER OF THE GROUP WAS GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM BY THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES
