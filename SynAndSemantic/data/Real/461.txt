SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN DISCUSSES THE TUMULTUOUS CALIFORNIA ELECTION 
WHAT'S A DEMOCRAT TO DO NOW THAT THE ONE HUNDRED THIRD CONGRESS IS HISTORY AND THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED ONE HUNDRED FOURTH PROMISES TO BE ANYTHING BUT BUSINESS AS USUAL 
WE'LL WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO ENACT THE LINE ITEM VETO TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS FOR TERM LIMITS TO ENACT CAMPAIGN SPENDING REFORM WHICH IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TODAY THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY 
WHAT'S THIS DEMOCRAT TO DO WHEN SHE CLAIMS VICTORY AND HER OPPONENT IN CALIFORNIA'S CAUSTIC AND COSTLY SENATE RACE CLAIMS FRAUD 
IT'S SO OVERWHELMING I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD HAVE A NEW ELECTION 
IF IT'S NOT IF IT'S NOT I WILL CONGRATULATE MS. FEINSTEIN ON HER VICTORY BUT I THINK FRANKLY THE FRAUD IS OVERWHELMING 
IS SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S STAR STILL BRIGHT THOUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S WHOLE CONSTELLATION HAS DIMMED 
FROM WASHINGTON THIS IS NEWSMAKER SATURDAY WITH CHARLES BIERBAUER 
THANKS FOR JOINING US 
WITH CONGRESS'S LAME DUCKS PACKING UP AND LIMPING HOME WE MAY ALL BE RELIEVED THAT THIS SESSION IS OVER BUT IT'S ALWAYS OPEN SEASON FOR POLITICS IN WASHINGTON AND TO HELP US TAKE AIM ON THE NEW CONGRESS OUR GUEST IS SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN OF CALIFORNIA 
THE SENATOR WAS ELECTED TO A SHORT TERM IN CONGRESS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND WITH NEARLY FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF LAST MONTH'S VOTE IS THE PRESUMPTIVE THOUGH NOT YET CERTIFIED WINNER OF A FULL TERM IN THE SENATE 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SENATOR AND WITH ME TO QUESTION SENATOR FEINSTEIN IS GLORIA BORGER ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR AND POLITICAL COLUMNIST FOR U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT 
SENATOR IS THIS ELECTION AND YOUR OF THIS SEAT IN ANY WAY TARNISHED BY THE KIND OF RACE THAT WAS RUN IN CALIFORNIA BY THE KIND OF CHARGES WE'RE HEARING OF FRAUD 
WELL SEE THIS WAS THE WORST RACE I'VE BEEN IN IN MY LIFE 
SINCE FEBRUARY BLATANT MISLEADING MISCHARACTERIZING I THINK SPOTS WERE RUN IN A BARRAGE THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY 
NEVER HAS ANYONE SPENT THE KIND OF MONEY MY OPPONENT DID OR ENGAGED IN THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN MY OPPONENT DID 
SO THE FACT THAT I ENDURED AND ENDURED BY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND VOTES WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS HISTORICALLY NOT A CLOSE ELECTION YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER BEAT ED BY LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VOTES 
WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA 
THAT'S RIGHT AND BEAT BRADLEY BY UNDER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTES 
SO I LOOK AT THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SURPRISE THAT MY OPPONENT DIDN'T PICK UP THE PHONE AND SAY YOU KNOW CONGRATULATIONS YOU'VE WON AS I HAVE DONE WHEN I HAVE LOST RACES 
THE REASON YOUR OPPONENT CONGRESSMAN HUFFINGTON SAYS HE WON'T DO THAT IS HE IS CONTINUING TO ALLEGE THAT THERE WERE IMPROPRIETIES THAT THERE WERE IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
SO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AS BITTER AND NASTY WAS THE ELECTION RACE BUT THE POST ELECTION RACE CONTINUES TO BE ACCUSATORY 
LET ME PLAY A PIECE OF TAPE AND GET YOU TO RESPOND HERE 
THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE HUFFINGTON THE OTHER NIGHT 
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S A LOT OF VOTER FRAUD AND WE'RE FINDING OUT DAILY THAT NEW THINGS ARE COMING IN WITH PEOPLE WHO EITHER AREN'T LEGAL CITIZENS WHO ARE VOTING THEY'VE MOVED AND ARE VOTING IN THE WRONG PLACE 
WE HAVE BOARDED UP SHACKS WHERE PEOPLE SAY THEY LIVE 
WE HAVE PEOPLE VOTING IN VACANT PARKING LOTS 
IS THIS WHAT'S HAPPENED 
WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE 
HE GOT A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER ON THE BASIS OF THAT COMMENT 
THERE WAS A HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE IN LOS ANGELES 
THE JUDGE SAID WHERE IS YOUR EVIDENCE 
AND THEY DIDN'T SUBMIT ANY EVIDENCE SO NOW THEY'RE GOING OUT AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE 
BUT I DIDN'T WIN BY ONE HUNDRED VOTES OR EIGHT HUNDRED VOTES OR TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND VOTES 
HOW IS THAT ISSUE THAT HE'S PROMOTING NOW THAT THERE WAS FRAUD OR SHACKS HOW IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION 
BECAUSE UNLESS HE CAN SAY THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR ME FRAUDULENTLY I HAVE LEGALLY WON THIS ELECTION AND I BELIEVE I WILL BE CERTIFIED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE AS THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION 
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE 
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO UNBELIEVABLE TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN 
BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE MORE THAN SOUR GRAPES 
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF FRAUD 
I HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF FRAUD AND THE PROPER PLACE TO SUBMIT EVIDENCE FOR FRAUD IS TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF A COUNTY 
THERE MAY BE SOME INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON BUT IF THERE ARE ONE OR TWO OR TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED INSTANCES OF SOMEONE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE VOTED WHO VOTED DOES THAT UNDO A PLURALITY OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND VOTES 
THAT'S THE ISSUE 
IS THIS SOMETHING MR. HUFFINGTON CAN'T LET GO OF 
HOW DO YOU JUDGE THIS 
WELL I THINK MR. HUFFINGTON IS USED TO GETTING WHAT HE WANTS AND HE WANTS THIS AND HE SPENT MORE THAN ANYBODY EVER HAS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY TO BUY IT AND HE COULDN'T BUY IT AND NOW HE'S GOING TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OF WINNING IT 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING 
SENATOR YOU SAID BEFORE THAT YOU WERE THE VICTIM OF SOME T. V. ADS THAT WERE UNTRUE 
NOW YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT TELEVISION ADS IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
TELL US WHAT YOU WOULD DO FOR SENATORS IN YOUR POSITION IN ANOTHER CAMPAIGN AND HOW CAN YOU CHANGE THIS WHOLE PROCESS 
WELL I THINK THAT CAMPAIGN SPENDING REFORM HAS TO GO BACK ON THE FRONT BURNER IN A MAJOR WAY AND I THINK THE DEAL BREAKER IN CAMPAIGN SPENDING REFORM WAS WHAT PEOPLE PERCEIVED TO BE WHEN YOU LIMITED THE AMOUNT UNDER BUCKLEY VERSUS YOU ALSO HAD TO THEN PROVIDE SOME PUBLIC FINANCING AND THE PUBLIC FINANCING WAS DONE THROUGH LOBBY DISCLOSURE FEES AND OTHER THINGS BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE THAT AND IT WAS USED AS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST 
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO ANY PUBLIC FINANCING 
I THINK WE SHOULD FIND A WAY AND I BELIEVE WE CAN TO CAP THE RACES TO CAP THE AMOUNT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN PUT INTO A RACE AND TO PROVIDE AN AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS ACT WHICH WOULD ENABLE A TELEVISION STATION IF THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT AN AD WAS FALSE AND DEFAMATORY NOT TO RUN IT 
WHAT WE FOUND IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS EVEN WHEN A STATION WOULD TELL US YES THEY SAW WHERE THE AD WAS FALSE THEY STILL HAD TO RUN IT 
DO YOU HAVE SUPPORT FOR THAT IN THE SENATE 
I THINK WE HAVE INCREASING SUPPORT FOR IT AND THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE THERE NEVER HAS BEEN A CAMPAIGN WHERE THERE ARE MORE NEGATIVE AND NASTY SPOTS OUT THERE THAN THIS PAST ONE AND I THINK THAT HAS CAUSED PEOPLE TO THINK AND PARTICULARLY THE CALIFORNIA RACE HAS CAUSED PEOPLE TO THINK BECAUSE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA RACE SIGNALED IS ANYBODY THAT'S WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND PUT UP THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T HAVE TO DEBATE THEIR OPPONENT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO PRESS INTERVIEWS DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE OUT A VOTING RECORD DOESN'T HAVE TO REDUCE TAX REFORM 
THEY JUST DO THEIR NUMBER IN THIRTY SECOND SOUND BITES AND THAT'S NOT WHAT ELECTION TO THE HIGHEST BODY IN THE LAND SHOULD BE 
LET ME PICK UP 
WHEN YOU SAY YOU WOULD CAP THE SPENDING WHERE WOULD YOU CAP IT IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA 
WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROXIMATE AMOUNT 
AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU COULD CAP THE SPENDING BUT HOW DO YOU GET RID OF THE NEGATIVES 
YOU WOULD HAVE FEWER OF THEM WITH LESS SPENDING 
WELL THE SPENDING IN THE LAST BILL THAT WE CONSIDERED AND WAS PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE CALIFORNIA WAS THE HIGHEST STATE BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST CAPPED AT EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IT WENT DOWN FROM THERE BASED ON POPULATION OF THE STATE 
AND I THINK TO BASE A CAP ON POPULATION MAKES VERY GOOD SENSE AND IT ALSO PROVIDES THAT INDIVIDUALS IN VERY SMALL STATES CAN COVER THEIR STATES 
WHEN YOU RUN IN A STATE THAT'S BIGGER THAN MOST NATIONS IT'S A VERY REAL PROBLEM TO GO DOOR TO DOOR OR EVEN SOMETIMES COUNTY TO COUNTY 
BUT SENATOR NOW THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CONTROL THE SENATE ANYMORE WHY WOULD THEY GO ALONG WITH CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM AND TRY AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD 
THEY WANT TO GET A MAJORITY BACK 
WELL THIS MAY SOUND NAIVE BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THE TRACK THAT CAMPAIGNS ARE ON IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR EITHER PARTY BECAUSE I BELIEVE VERY MUCH THAT WE CAN WORK 
I BELIEVE THERE ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE IN BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES AND I BELIEVE WE ARE ELECTED I'M A DEMOCRAT 
I'M ELECTED TO BRING MY VIEWPOINT TO SIT DOWN WITH COLLEAGUES AND WORK OUT A SOLUTION JUST AS WE DID ON THE ASSAULT WEAPONS LEGISLATION ON THE DESERT BILL JUST AS WE'LL DO ON A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT OR ON ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES UP BUT TO WORK OUT THE DIFFERENCES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED IS IT'S BEEN A VERY DISTASTEFUL KIND OF PARTISANSHIP AND FORTUNATELY THERE ARE PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES THAT ARE PREPARED TO RESIST IT AND I WAS VERY BY WHAT SENATOR LOTT SAID TODAY THAT HE LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING IN A BIPARTISAN WAY 
HE AND I HAVE WORKED ON A BILL THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF LUCK WITH BUT WE WORKED TOGETHER ON AND THAT WAS TO PUT OFF THE NEXT ROUND OF BASE CLOSURES 
SENATOR LOTT IS OF COURSE THE NEWLY ELECTED MAJORITY WHIP IN THE SENATE A REPUBLICAN 
YOU'VE TOUCHED ON A NUMBER OF AGENDA ISSUES BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT LINE ITEM VETO 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WANT TO GO WHEN WE COME BACK 
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK 
STAY WITH US PLEASE 
COMMERCIAL BREAK 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN YOU LISTED THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT LINE ITEM VETO TERM LIMITS 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING NEWT GINGRICH HAS WRITTEN 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN CONTRACT 
ARE YOU REALLY CLOSE IN LINE WITH THAT 
WELL I CAMPAIGNED ON IT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN I RAN 
I VOTED FOR IT AND I CAMPAIGNED AGAIN 
IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WORD A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT AND I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO WORD ONE THAT'LL MAKE SOME SENSE AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT MAKES SENSE OBVIOUSLY IT TAKES TIME TO ACCOMPLISH IT 
IT ALSO TAKES TIME FOR RATIFICATION 
SO THE TIME THAT'S BUILT INTO IT AND EXACTLY WHAT IS COVERED BY IT ARE REALLY THE ISSUES FOR NEGOTIATION 
ON THE LINE ITEM VETO THERE ISN'T A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ANY CORPORATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE BUDGET OF THEIR COMPANY AND YET THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE BUDGET 
I THINK IT DOES TWO THINGS 
I THINK IT WILL ENSURE A DISCIPLINE 
I THINK IT WILL GIVE A BLUE PENCIL THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND I THINK IT IS THE BIGGEST ANTIDOTE TO THE PORK BARREL I KNOW 
WELL ARE YOU CONCERNED JUST TO FOLLOW THIS ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE AGENDA TO THE REPUBLICANS 
NO NOT NECESSARILY AND I'M NOT THE ONLY DEMOCRAT THAT FEELS THIS WAY 
I THINK ONE OF THE MISTAKES PEOPLE HAVE MADE IS TO SAY THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC TERRITORIES AND THE PARTIES DO NOT CROSS ON THEM 
I THINK THERE ARE SOME YES BUT I DO NOT THINK THESE ARE NECESSARILY THEM 
PAUL SIMON AS YOU KNOW WAS ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF THE LAST BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT 
SO IT HAS BEEN A BIPARTISAN EFFORT 
LET ME JUST SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT TO TALK ABOUT PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WAS A MAJOR ISSUE IN YOUR CAMPAIGN AND IT'S A MEASURE THAT WOULD DENY MEDICAL AND EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS TO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN YOUR STATE 
YOU WERE OPPOSED TO IT AND THE VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED IT IN CALIFORNIA 
WHO WAS RIGHT 
WELL I KNEW WHEN I DID THAT THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY COST ME THE ELECTION 
WE ESTIMATE IT COST SIX TO TEN POINTS 
HAVING SAID THAT I COULDN'T HAVE LIVED WITH MYSELF BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHAT ONE EIGHTY SEVEN DOES IS SAY THAT CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THE WAY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THEY ARE GOING TO BE PROHIBITED AN EDUCATION AND I THINK THAT'S A TERRIBLE MISTAKE AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT STOPS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
I BELIEVE WHAT WE MUST DO AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING AGAIN IN A BIPARTISAN WAY PARTICULARLY WITH ALAN SIMPSON WHO HEADS THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
WE CAN STOP IT AT ITS BORDER 
I'VE BEEN TO THE BORDER MANY TIMES 
THERE'S A NEW OPERATION GOING ON ON THE SOUTHWEST BORDER AND IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT EFFECTIVE NOW 
WE NEED TO DO SOME OTHER THINGS 
WE NEED TO HAVE A COUNTERFEIT PROOF SYSTEM OF DETERMINING WORK ELIGIBILITY AND THAT COULD ALSO WITH WELFARE ELIGIBILITY 
WE NEED TO STOP IMMIGRATION AT THE BORDERS WHICH MEANS HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF BORDER PATROL GIVE THEM THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED 
WE NEED TO STOP ILLEGAL SMUGGLING 
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THE U. S. ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO TOLD ME THAT THE AVERAGE FEDERAL SENTENCE FOR SOMEBODY CONVICTED OF ALIEN SMUGGLING WITH A PRIOR WAS ZERO TO SIX MONTHS 
BUT SENATOR 
WE'LL CHANGE THAT 
BUT YOU SEEM TO BE TALKING ABOUT MORE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT HERE BEEFING UP BORDER PATROLS ET CETERA 
IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY 
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET 
WHERE DO YOU GET THE MONEY FOR THIS THEN 
WELL IN MY LEGISLATION I PUT IN A FUNDING MECHANISM AND WHAT IT IS IS A BORDER CROSSING FEE OF ONE DOLLAR WHICH WOULD PRODUCE AT A MINIMUM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS 
IT WOULD BE MUCH AS SOMEBODY THAT CROSSES A BRIDGE 
WE'VE GOT IN MY CITY THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE THE OAKLAND BAY BRIDGE AND PEOPLE PAY THREE DOLLARS A DAY WHEN THEY COME IN TO WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO ON THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE 
YOU WOULD JUST SIMPLY PAY 
YOU COULD HAVE COMMUTER BOOKS BUT YOU WOULD PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU USE AND THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE BORDER PATROL AND CUSTOMS AND NARCOTICS ABATEMENT AND ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT ILLEGAL SMUGGLING 
THAT'S A TAX ISN'T IT 
IT'S A CROSSING FEE WHICH IS PAID FOR BY THE PEOPLE THAT USE THE BORDER 
IS THAT POPULAR 
IT'S NOT PAID BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T USE THE BORDER 
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND PERHAPS TEXAS 
IT'S VERY POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA 
POLLS HAVE SHOWN IT'S GETTING OVER EIGHTY PERCENT SUPPORT FROM THE PEOPLE 
SPEAKING OF TAXES WHERE ARE YOU ON THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT 
SEE I THINK THAT WAS THE ONE PERHAPS MAJOR CRIPPLING THING IN THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM 
THE CAMPAIGN COMMITTED TO A MIDDLE INCOME TAX CUT 
NOW SOME OF THIS WAS PROVIDED WITH THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH PROVIDES THAT IF YOU EARN UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR YOU GET A TAX CREDIT 
BUT FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S WHERE FAMILIES ARE THE HARDEST HIT AND ONE OF THE MOST PREVAILING FEELINGS OUT THERE IS YOU KNOW I WORK HARD 
I PLAY BY THE RULES 
I PAY MY TAXES AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY JOB 
I TAKE HOME LESS AND THE FRUSTRATION IS ALL THIS GOVERNMENT 
I'M PAYING FOR ALL THE GUYS THAT DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES 
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK GIVING RELIEF TO THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SO IMPORTANT AND I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THAT GOT BY BUT NOW THAT THERE IS DEFICIT REDUCTION NOW THAT THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE IS BEING DIMINISHED NOW THAT THE ECONOMY IS IN RECOVERY AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS DROPPING AND WITH G. A. T. T. WHICH OVER TIME SHOULD INCREASE REVENUES I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ONE 
WELL AND THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT CLINTON IS THIS WEEK NOW TALKING ABOUT WORKING OUT SOME KIND OF A MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT BUT IT COMES BACK TO THE QUESTION I ASKED YOU BEFORE 
HASN'T HE BEEN PUSHED TO ALL THIS BY THE REPUBLICANS RATHER THAN MOVING ON HIS OWN AGENDA TO GET THERE 
AND 
LOOK MAY I SAY THIS 
SURE 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE BUDGET DEFICIT BECAUSE 
HE DID THAT 
THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF 
BUT HE DID THAT AND THEN PRETTY MUCH ABANDONED THAT MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT 
WELL THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WAS BAD AND REVENUES WEREN'T COMING IN AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH THE DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE 
IF YOU REMEMBER CHARLES INTEREST RATES DROPPED 
PEOPLE COULD REFINANCE THEIR HOMES 
THAT WAS WORTH ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERYBODY THAT REFINANCED THEIR HOMES AND NEW JOBS BEGAN TO COME ON LINE 
IF YOU 
NOW IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THIS NEXT SESSION I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT 
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
THIS NEXT SESSION IF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE MINORITY ARE GOING TO REACH ANY BIPARTISANSHIP WITH THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP THE WHITE HOUSE AT ARM'S LENGTH ON CAPITOL HILL 
WELL YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHY ALL THE TALK IN THIS TOWN IS ALWAYS YOU KNOW DO YOU THE WHITE HOUSE OR WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT 
I THINK WHAT YOU DO IS YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE 
YOU GO UP AND YOU SAY WHAT YOU THINK 
YOU PUT TOGETHER MAJORITIES OR ON BOTH SIDES AND THAT'S SEE I WILL SAY THIS 
I THINK IF THERE'S ONE MISTAKE IN THE SENATE AND I REALLY SAY THIS AND I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT YOU CANNOT WORK ONLY WITH THE LEADERSHIP 
YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE RANK AND FILE MEMBERS AS WELL BECAUSE THE SENATORS ARE ALL 
AND ON BIG ISSUES THAT INVOLVE THEIR CONSTITUENCIES THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BUY LEADERSHIP 
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS 
WE'VE GOT ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS 
GLORIA 
WHAT SHOULD THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITIES ASIDE FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT BE 
OH I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S PRIORITY FRANKLY OUGHT TO BE WELFARE REFORM SPECIFICALLY NOT A HUGE COMPLICATED GOVERNMENT PROGRAM OR WE'LL GO RIGHT BACK TO HEALTH CARE REFORM AGAIN BUT A CUT OFF OF FEDERAL DOLLARS AFTER SO LONG IF A PERSON IS ABLE TO WORK 
IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO WORK I THINK THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY WELFARE REFORM 
LIMITED HEALTH CARE REFORM PORTABILITY INSURANCE REFORM AND ENCOURAGING THE STATES TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA BUT VERY LIMITED AND VERY LITTLE GOVERNMENTAL INTERFERENCE 
WE'VE REACHED OUR LIMIT AND OUR CUT OFF HERE
