WELCOME TO LARRY KING LIVE 
TONIGHT IS THIS THE SHORTEST HONEYMOON EVER 
STRIKE ONE FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AS HIS CHOICE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL FALLS OUT OF THE RUNNING 
DID THE ZOE BAIRD DEBACLE HAVE TO HAPPEN 
AND HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT FOLLOW UP 
PLUS ACTOR ALAN RECALLS BASEBALL'S GLORY DAYS IN A NEW MOVIE 
NOW HERE'S LARRY KING 
GOOD EVENING FROM WASHINGTON 
CALL IT THE WORLD'S SHORTEST HONEYMOON 
THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY DIDN'T LAST ONE FULL DAY BEFORE A POLITICAL CRISIS 
HIS CHOICE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL PROVED THE EQUIVALENT OF BOX OFFICE POISON 
ZOE BAIRD HAD ADMITTED HIRING ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR WHILE AVOIDING THE PROPER TAXES 
AS HER STORY UNFOLDED ON TELEVISION LIT UP AND HER ODDS OF CONFIRMATION DWINDLED 
WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE ZOE BAIRD NOMINATION AND HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE 
TWO DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE SENATE PANEL THAT QUESTIONED MS. BAIRD ARE WITH US TONIGHT 
IN WASHINGTON SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN DEMOCRAT OF ALABAMA AND A FORMER JUDGE 
FROM DENVER IN HIS HOME STATE OF COLORADO IS REPUBLICAN SENATOR HANK BROWN 
AND BOTH ARE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
WHAT HAPPENED HOWELL 
WHAT WENT WRONG 
WELL I THINK THAT SHE ENTERED REALLY IN EFFECT A PLEA OF GUILTY AND SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WERE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES 
THEY ASSOCIATED THEMSELVES WITH 
THEY ASSOCIATED THEMSELVES WITH TAX FORMS WITH PAPERS 
AND MANY WOMEN HAVE TO FILL THAT OUT 
THE HUSBANDS LEAVE THOSE THINGS TO THEM 
AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTCRY FROM THE WOMEN AGAINST HER 
WAS THIS ALSO THE NATURE OF HER APPOINTMENT 
IF SHE HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO HUD OR TREASURY DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME 
I DON'T KNOW 
I'VE HAD IT BOTH WAYS 
I'VE HEARD ARGUMENTS AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN BOTH WAYS 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME 
WERE YOU LEANING FOR CONFIRMATION 
WELL AT THE TIME I ALWAYS TRY TO RESERVE MY OPINION TILL AFTER ALL THE EVIDENCE IS IN BUT I HAD STRONG AND COMPELLING RESERVATIONS 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO VOTE FOR HER 
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HEARD HER HUSBAND GIVE HIS EXPLANATION TO LISTEN TO THE LAWYER AND TO THE COUPLE INVOLVED AND I THINK 
THEY WERE ALL GOING TO BE WITNESSES 
WELL NOT NECESSARILY BUT THEY HAD BEEN REQUESTED 
WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE ENDED UP BEING WITNESSES REMAINED TO BE SEEN 
THE HUSBAND WOULD HAVE I KNOW 
SENATOR WERE YOU BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE HERE SENATOR BROWN IN THAT A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS LIKED ZOE BAIRD 
ZOE BAIRD IS A BRIGHT BRIGHT WOMAN HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT HER IS SOME REAL MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE 
AS YOU KNOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS NINETY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES 
THE PROBLEMS I THINK WERE TWO THINGS 
ONE THE ADMINISTRATION MISCALCULATED 
THEY HAD THOUGHT AT LEAST THEIR SPOKESMAN INDICATED THAT ZOE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG 
IT TURNS OUT THAT SHE'D HAD LEGAL ADVICE 
SHE KNEW IT WAS WRONG BEFORE SHE DID IT AND WENT AHEAD ANYWAY 
AND THE SECOND THING THAT HAPPENED IS SOME OF THE LIBERAL GROUPS ABANDONED HER 
AND WHEN THEY LEFT SHE SIMPLY WAS LEFT WITHOUT A BASE 
WHERE WERE YOU 
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE INFRACTION 
ACTUALLY THERE WERE SIX DIFFERENT VIOLATIONS FAILURE TO PAY SOCIAL SECURITY TAX TO WITHHOLD SOCIAL SECURITY TAX FAILURE TO FILL OUT AN I NINE FORM FAILURE TO FILL OUT A WITHHOLDING FORM A WIDE VARIETY OF PROBLEMS OVER AND ABOVE HIRING THE ILLEGAL ALIEN 
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT 
I WANTED TO LISTEN TO ALL THE WITNESSES BUT FRANKLY I WAS LEANING AGAINST HER IF THOSE CHARGES TURNED OUT TO BE ACCURATE 
ARE YOU SAYING HANK THAT HAD IT GONE TO THE SENATE SHE'D HAVE LOST 
I THINK SO 
AND THE REASON I THINK SO IS THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH SOME OF THESE LAWS AND THEY ARE A PAIN IN THE NECK THOUGHT IF THEY HAVE TO DO IT SURELY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS TO 
ALL RIGHT 
ALL THE TELEVISION NETWORKS C. N. N. INCLUDED SHOWED PICTURES OF SENATE OFFICES ANSWERING PHONE CALLS STRONGLY AGAINST MS. BAIRD 
WHY DID YOU LET THOSE CAMERAS IN 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LET THEM IN 
SOME ARE SAYING YOU LET THEM IN TO BACK UP A DECISION YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE AND THIS MADE IT EASIER 
WHAT 
CAMERAS IN WHERE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THE 
CAMERAS INTO SENATE OFFICES WHERE WE SAW SECRETARIES AND PRESS REPRESENTATIVES ANSWERING CALLS AGAINST ZOE BAIRD 
I DON'T KNOW 
IF THEY DID IT IN MY OFFICE I DON'T KNOW 
THEY MADE THE DECISION STAFF 
I WAS AT THE HEARING ROOM SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY LET THEM IN OR DON'T LET THEM IN 
I DIDN'T MAKE THE DECISION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME IF THEY LET THEM IN 
DID YOUR OFFICE GET A LOT OF CALLS 
OH YES 
WE GOT A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF CALLS 
ALL RIGHT NOW WHAT GENERATED THIS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK GENERATED IT HANK 
SOME THINK THE TALK SHOWS AROUND AMERICA GENERATED IT 
WELL LARRY YOU KNOW POLITICIANS CAN'T SAY NO TO TELEVISION 
I SUSPECT THAT WHILE THEY DIDN'T COME TO MY OFFICE THEY'D PROBABLY BE WELCOME IN MOST ANY 
WHAT I THINK HAPPENED WAS PEOPLE WHO'D HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF FILLING OUT THESE FORMS AND THEY ARE A MESS AND A PAIN IN THE NECK JUST SIMPLY REACTED FROM THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES AND FIGURED THAT IF THEY HAD TO DO IT BY GOLLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS GOING TO ENFORCE IT SURE OUGHT TO 
AND FRANKLY THE FLOOD OF CALLS WE GOT AT OUR OFFICE I THINK WERE LIKE THOSE IN OTHER OFFICES 
THEY WERE NOT NECESSARILY AN ORGANIZED CAMPAIGN 
THEY WERE SIMPLY ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE 
SO THE CHARGE THAT THIS WAS SOME LIBERAL MOVEMENT OR THAT SOME TALK SHOW HOSTS ACROSS AMERICA WERE SPURRING IT ON AS THEY DID WITH THE HOUSE AND THE BANKING YOU DON'T BUY 
NUMBER 
I THINK IT CAME FROM JUST THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR OWN CONCERNS 
WE GOT CALLS FROM MY STATE OFFICES FROM SMALL TOWNS ALL AROUND WHERE THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN ORGANIZED EFFORT OR WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A TALK SHOW 
IT WAS JUST PEOPLE JUST HAD DEEP FEELINGS ABOUT IT 
I MEAN THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SAME POSITION AND SAID WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME YOU KNOW AND THEY LOOKED AT HER CIRCUMSTANCES 
NOW WHAT DOES A CALL MEAN TO A SENATOR 
WELL WE PAY ATTENTION TO CALLS IN PARTICULAR TO THOSE CALLS WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT AN ORGANIZED CAMPAIGN 
WE'VE HAD CALLS I RECKON ON THE BORK HEARING I MUST HAVE GOTTEN FIFTY THOUSAND PHONE CALLS BUT THEY EITHER CAME FROM ONE ORGANIZED GROUP OR ANOTHER ORGANIZED GROUP 
AND YOU KNOW 
AND YOU KNOW IT 
YOU CAN TELL IT 
THEY GIVE THEM THE WORDS 
ALL THEY DO IS PARROT THE SAME THING 
AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN IT'S THE SAME MESSAGE AND YOU KNOW IT'S COMING FROM AN ORGANIZED EFFORT 
BUT WHEN THESE WERE COMING IN WITH DIFFERENT MESSAGES ALL OVER THE WHOLE AREA YOU KNEW THAT IT WAS COMING FROM THEIR HEARTS AND MINDS 
HANK DO YOU READ IT THE SAME WAY 
I THINK THE CALLS WERE ESSENTIALLY THAT 
I'M SURE THERE WERE SOME ORGANIZED CALLS BUT THE BULK OF THEM WERE SIMPLY VOLUNTEERED 
AND THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS I THINK THAT WAS SO COMPELLING WAS IF SHE'D MADE A MISTAKE AND HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF THE LAW I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE REQUEST FOR FORGIVENESS 
BUT THE FACT THAT SHE CONSULTED A LAWYER FIRST KNEW IT WAS WRONG KNEW IT WAS ILLEGAL AND CHOSE TO DO IT ANYWAY I THINK PUT A CAP ON IT 
WHAT IMPACT IF ANY DID SENATOR PUBLIC STATEMENT AND FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA JORDAN'S PUBLIC STATEMENT HAVE IF ANY 
I'M SURE THEY HAD SOME 
BUT I WENT TO A DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS BEFORE I'D HEARD OF SENATOR 
WE'D HEARD OF BARBARA JORDAN'S 
AND THE SPONTANEOUS PEOPLE WHO WERE SPEAKING UP LIBERALS MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS WERE SPEAKING UP NO WAY 
NO WAY 
THEY WERE JUST SAYING THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE CONFIRMED 
SHE OUGHT TO WITHDRAW 
THEY WERE SAYING THAT 
DID SENATOR KASSEBAUM INFLUENCE YOU AT ALL SENATOR BROWN 
WELL I THINK ALL REPUBLICANS AND I SUSPECT MOST AMERICANS HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR SENATOR KASSEBAUM VERY WELL THOUGHT OF 
BUT I THINK SENATOR HEFLIN HAS PUT HIS FINGER ON IT 
IT WAS THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE 
SENATOR KASSEBAUM AND BARBARA JORDAN REPRESENT THEIR PARTIES ARE THOUGHT TO BE MAINSTREAM IN THEIR PARTIES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SENATORS COMING OUT AGAINST HER I SUSPECT SHE HAD BOTH OF THEM HAD AN INFLUENCE 
WE'LL GET A BREAK TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL EFFECT IF ANY ON CLINTON AND WHO MIGHT BE THE NEXT APPOINTEE 
WE'LL BE TAKING YOUR CALLS AS WELL 
ALAN IS STILL TO COME 
MONDAY NIGHT HIS FIRST APPEARANCE SINCE LEAVING THE POST THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE LAWRENCE EAGLEBURGER WILL BE HERE 
SECRETARY OF STATE EAGLEBURGER MONDAY NIGHT ON LARRY KING LIVE WITH YOUR PHONE CALLS 
DON'T GO AWAY 
I'M SAD ABOUT IT BUT IT WASN'T AGONIZING 
I'M JUST VERY I'M SAD ABOUT IT 
AND I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY AS I SAID IN MY STATEMENT FOR THE WAY THE EVALUATION WAS DONE 
IT WAS I STILL HAVE A VERY HIGH REGARD FOR HER 
SHE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON 
AND I FEEL VERY BADLY ABOUT IT BUT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR IT 
WELCOME BACK TO LARRY KING LIVE 
WE'LL BE GOING TO YOUR PHONE CALLS IN A LITTLE WHILE 
OUR GUESTS ARE SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN DEMOCRAT OF ALABAMA AND IN DENVER SENATOR HANK BROWN REPUBLICAN OF COLORADO BOTH MEMBERS OF THE VERY PRESTIGIOUS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
WHAT NOW SENATOR HEFLIN 
PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID TODAY AT HIS FIRST CABINET MEETING AT THE END OF IT THAT HE'S GOING TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON NOW LOOKING AT TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
I SUSPECT HE'LL REALLY THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE IT ASK HIS TEAM TRANSITION TEAM TO FIND THE BEST QUALIFIED PERSON 
AND HE SAYS THAT HE WANTS THE BEST QUALIFIED PERSON AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD BE 
DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE A WOMAN 
WELL I THINK IF EVERYTHING'S EQUAL IF IT COMES DOWN WE'LL SAY TO FOUR PEOPLE TWO MEN TWO WOMEN IF THEY'RE ALL EQUAL I THINK HE'LL STAY WITH A WOMAN 
BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO SEEK THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HANK 
WELL THE PRESIDENT'S PAINTED HIMSELF IN A CORNER ON THIS 
HE PLEDGED IN THE CAMPAIGN TO HAVE ABOUT HALF OF HIS CABINET WOMEN 
HE'S FAR SHORT OF THAT GOAL AND THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM TO HAVE ONE 
BUT THE REALITY IS THERE ARE NUMEROUS VERY WELL QUALIFIED WOMEN 
I SUSPECT IT'LL BE A WOMAN 
BUT HE HAS TO ACT QUICKLY AND I THINK HE HAS TO MAKE SURE THIS TIME THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT QUALIFICATIONS 
WHY DIDN'T THEY READ THIS RIGHT HOWELL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE WHAT WENT WRONG IN TRANSITION 
WELL I THINK THEY WERE IN A LITTLE BIT TOO BIG A HURRY 
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT HE WANTED THAT TURNED HIM DOWN 
YES 
I UNDERSTAND AT LEAST TWO 
AND I THINK THIS WAS A SORT OF A LATE INNING DECISION 
AND OBVIOUSLY THEY DIDN'T EVALUATE IT PROPERLY AND I THINK IT THEY'LL BENEFIT AS A RESULT OF THEIR ERROR 
HOW LONG SENATOR BROWN SHOULD WE BE WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY GENERAL 
IN OTHER WORDS WHILE WE WANT AN EXCELLENT APPOINTMENT SHOULD IT ALSO BE EXPEDITED 
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE EXPEDITED BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO FUNCTION JUST FINE WITHOUT ONE FOR A WHILE 
THEY HAVE ABLE PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE THE LOWER SPOTS AND RUN IT 
AS A MATTER OF FACT I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW WELL THE COUNTRY WOULD RUN WITHOUT CONGRESS FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
SO I DON'T SEE ANY MAJOR EMERGENCY HERE 
BUT HE DOES I THINK HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPOINTMENT THAT COMES OUT IS THE RIGHT ONE 
WHEN DO YOU EXPECT A NOMINATION 
I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AT LEAST 
OH REALLY 
YES 
YES 
UNLESS ONE OF THOSE THAT TURNED HIM DOWN GOT BACK IN 
YES WELL THAT MIGHT BE 
BUT I THINK OTHERWISE IT'LL BE THAT 
THE PROBLEM THEY'VE GOT IS THAT IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET AN F. B. I. CHECK DONE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NEW PERSON 
SO THEY MAY WELL HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED TO SOMEONE THEY'VE ALREADY CHECKED OUT 
SAN MATEO CALIFORNIA AS WE GO TO CALLS FOR SENATOR HEFLIN AND SENATOR BROWN HELLO 
THANK YOU LARRY 
I WANT TO STATE FIRST THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE ACTION OF THE SENATORS AND THE PUBLIC WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A GREAT DEMOCRACY IN ACTION BRINGING FORTH AN ISSUE 
HOWEVER AS AN OLD NAVAL I'VE DISCOVERED THAT THE RECOVERY FROM A MISTAKE OFTEN MAKES A MORE PROFESSIONAL 
AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SENATORS DIDN'T PICK UP THIS THEME ZOE RECOVERY 
THE FACT THAT SHE HE'S SAYING SHE HANDLED HERSELF WELL IN MAKING THIS MISTAKE ADMITTING IT COMING FORWARD WITH IT BEING HONEST ABOUT IT 
WELL THAT WAS TO HER BENEFIT BUT IT WAS ALSO A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS AND HOW THEY ARE TO BE ENFORCED 
THE METHOD OF ENFORCEMENT IS THROUGH EMPLOYER SANCTIONS AND THESE SANCTIONS WERE CONSIDERED A LONG TIME 
YOU KNOW AT THE TIME THAT THIS BILL WAS ADOPTED THEY GAVE AMNESTY TO THREE MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH I OPPOSED 
I WAS AGAINST THAT 
BUT NEVERTHELESS THE CONCEPT OF EMPLOYER SANCTIONS IN MY JUDGMENT WAS A WEAK METHOD OF ENFORCEMENT BUT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS COSTS HAVING TO EMPLOY ALL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY 
IN TAKING THE BLAME AS HE DID DO YOU THINK SENATOR BROWN THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HANDLED IT WELL TODAY 
I THINK THIS ISN'T GOING TO COUNT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT 
SURE THERE WAS A MISTAKE BUT IF HE MOVES AHEAD AND HANDLES IT RIGHT IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT HIM 
BUT I DO DISAGREE TO SOME EXTENT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
I THINK WHAT WAS WRONG WASN'T THAT SHE MADE A MISTAKE 
WHAT WAS WRONG IS THAT SHE KNEW IT WAS ILLEGAL AT THE TIME AND CHOSE TO DO IT 
AND IN ADDITION IT WAS COMPOUNDED BY THE FAILURE TO FILE SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES REALLY FIVE OTHER VIOLATIONS 
AND ALSO IN HER INCOME GROUP TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LOOKED STRANGE 
WELL THE THING YOU HAVE TO BE AMAZED AT IS IF A YALE LAW PROFESSOR AND AN EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT WOMAN WHO'S A CORPORATE COUNSEL FOR A MAJOR CORPORATION CAN'T FIGURE OUT THESE LAWS HOW ARE THE ORDINARY WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY GOING TO DO IT 
TO PASADENA HELLO 
HI 
IF PRESIDENT CLINTON HIRES ANOTHER FEMALE WOULD HE NOT BE FILLING A QUOTA POSITION THAN JUST FILLING THE PROPER POSITION 
WELL BASICALLY 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUOTA IN THIS 
HE WANTS TO TRY TO HAVE A BROAD DIVERSITY OF APPOINTMENTS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING 
I MEAN THERE'S NO QUESTION TODAY THAT WORKING WOMEN ARE FILLING JOBS FROM EXECUTIVE POSITIONS IN CORPORATIONS TO EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE 
AND I THINK IT'S A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE TAKING AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY AND IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A RECOGNITION HE RAN ON THE CAMPAIGN 
THAT WAS PART OF HIS CAMPAIGN 
PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM FOR IT 
PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM ON THAT 
DO YOU THINK IT'S A QUOTA HANK 
IT PRETTY CLEARLY IS 
HE'S COMMITTED HIMSELF IN THE CAMPAIGN TO HAVE ROUGHLY HALF THE CABINET WOMEN 
THE FACT IS HE'S FAR SHORT OF THAT 
HE IS IN A BOX 
BUT THE REALITY IS THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF VERY BRIGHT CAPABLE ABLE WELL TRAINED WOMEN ATTORNEYS THAT CAN DO A GREAT JOB HERE 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SENATORS HOWELL HEFLIN AND HANK BROWN AND MORE OF YOUR PHONE CALLS THEN THE BRILLIANT ALAN 
NEXT WEEK PAULA POUNDSTONE WILL BE WITH US THE VERY FUNNY PAULA POUNDSTONE BILL MOYERS AND DON'T FORGET MONDAY NIGHT THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE LARRY EAGLEBURGER 
DON'T GO AWAY 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DID RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE TRANSITION TEAM 
I DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE DETAILS ON THAT REPORT 
HAVE YOU TRIED TO GET THE DETAILS 
AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
WHATEVER THE EXACT MINUTE BY MINUTE DETAILS IT'S HARD TO RECONSTRUCT AT ANY TIME IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TRANSITION PROCESS DID MAKE A MISTAKE 
BACK TO YOUR CALLS FOR SENATORS HEFLIN AND BROWN 
OTTAWA CANADA HELLO 
HELLO LARRY 
HI 
YES AMERICA IS RESPECTED WORLDWIDE AS A COUNTRY OF LAWS 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS REPUTATION WOULD BE TARNISHED BY HAVING AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO ADMITS TO HAVING BROKEN THE LAW 
WELL I THINK IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND WE'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PUT UP THAT HAVE ADMITTED DOING THINGS AND THEN WITHDRAWN BEFORE THE GINSBURG NOMINATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT 
IT CERTAINLY THERE MAY BE TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT BUT THIS TO ME WAS SERIOUS AND I AGREE THAT CERTAINLY YOU WOULD EXPECT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE VIGOROUS AND IMPARTIAL AND TRY TO SEEK EQUAL JUSTICE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HANDICAP 
HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED FOR ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE WAY AS A PROMINENT DEMOCRAT FORMER JUDGE 
NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED FOR ANY NOMINATIONS 
INDEPENDENCE 
YOU KNOW 
I'M SORRY GO AHEAD HANK 
WELL WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS MS. BAIRD HAD CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY WHO APPARENTLY HAD EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN THIS AREA 
SHE WAS TOLD THAT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A PENALTY BROUGHT FOR SOMEONE IN CONNECTICUT FOR THIS CRIME EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WAS WRONG 
COULD IT HARM OUR REPUTATION 
YES BUT I THINK YOU CAN ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED VERY VIGOROUSLY 
INDEPENDENCE MISSOURI HELLO 
YES MY QUESTION WAS TO THE REPUBLICAN FROM DENVER 
IS THIS GOING TO BE CHARACTERISTIC OF BILL CLINTON AFTER HE'S MADE A DECISION TO GIVE IN TO PRESSURES OF SOCIAL GROUPS 
WELL I THINK THE ONLY FAIR ANSWER TO THAT IS TO WAIT AND SEE 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PRESSURES ON A PRESIDENT 
IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT HE MOVED QUICKLY IN THIS INSTANCE AND I THINK YOU MAY WELL SEE SOME REACTION TO HOW QUICKLY THEY MOVED REALLY SOMEWHAT BEFORE MS. BAIRD HAD REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO GIVE HER WHOLE CASE 
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS AND I THINK THE BOOK'S STILL OPEN ON HOW THE PRESIDENT WILL ULTIMATELY RESPOND 
THE REPUBLICANS TO THEIR CREDIT DID NOT DO ANY HACK HACK JOB ON ANY OF THESE PEOPLE DID THEY 
I THINK THERE WAS A STRONG FEELING THAT SHE DESERVED A FAIR CHANCE TO MAKE HER CASE AND THE REALITY WAS THAT 
AMONG THE OTHER NOMINEES THEY WERE ALMOST THEY PRETTY WELL BREEZED THROUGH DIDN'T THEY 
THEY DID INDEED AND I THINK THERE'S A STRONG FEELING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO NAME PEOPLE OF ITS OWN PHILOSOPHY TO THE JOBS 
THEY'LL BE JUDGED ON THE JOBS THEY DO 
AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH CALL THE NEXT APPOINTEE 
IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE DON'T YOU THINK FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PRESIDENT THAT LITERALLY HAS TO BE APPROVED 
OH YES 
OH YES 
I DON'T THINK HE CAN STAND ANOTHER DEFEAT ON THIS 
AND I HOPE IT COMES FROM SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT A BACKGROUND IN JUDICIAL MATTERS AS WELL 
IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT A BACKGROUND WITH CRIMINAL PROSECUTION YOU KNOW 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MAIN LINK FROM THE PUBLIC IS IN CONNECTION WITH ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS AND THE CRIMINAL LAWS 
DRUGS AND CRIME TODAY ARE PRIMARY PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S HAD SOME EXPERIENCE IN FIGHTING DRUGS AND CRIME 
LOS ANGELES HELLO 
HELLO 
FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT THAT LAW IS PRETTY POOR FOR THE HOME 
YES FOR A BUSINESS WHERE REVENUE COMES IN BUT NOT FOR A HOME 
BUT I JUST FEEL WE'RE A NATION OF SUCH SMALL MINDED PEOPLE TO TAKE WHAT I CONSIDER SUCH A SMALL ISSUE WHEN WE HAVE SUCH HUGE PROBLEMS THAT ZOE BAIRD WOULD HAVE BEEN SO CAPABLE WITH HER ENERGY AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS TO TAKE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH IS CUMBERSOME DOES NEED GOVERNMENT OVERHAULING 
SHE WOULD HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED WITH IN THE HOME 
I THINK YOU MAKE TWO GOOD POINTS THERE 
ONE MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE IS A CRITICAL FACTOR HERE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT NINETY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE TO DIRECT AND GUIDE AND INSPIRE 
AND SECONDLY THE TRUTH IS THERE WERE SIX VIOLATIONS HERE MANY OF WHICH MOST AMERICANS SIMPLY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO COPE OR PUT UP WITH 
THE REALITY IS A LOT OF VIOLATE THIS LAW SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FILL OUT ALL THOSE FORMS OR AREN'T EVEN AWARE THAT ALL OF THEM ARE REQUIRED 
PROBABLY WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO IS GO BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE LAWS PROVIDE SOME SORT OF EXEMPTION FOR THE NITPICK ASPECT OF THE PAPERWORK HERE 
THINK SO 
YES I THINK FRANKLY I OPPOSED THE LAW 
I THOUGHT THE LAW HAD A LOT OF MISTAKES IN IT THE AMNESTY OF THREE MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS WHEN IT CAME ALONG THE IDEA OF FORCING THE EMPLOYERS TO BE THE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BASICALLY AND NOT TO DO IT 
TO ME THERE IS ALSO DANGER OF DISCRIMINATION 
IF SOMEBODY SPEAKS WITH AN ACCENT THE AVERAGE PERSON DRAWS BACK I DON'T KNOW 
THEY MAY BE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN AND THEY'D BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT 
AND THERE COULD BE DISCRIMINATION IN REGARD TO THAT 
I THINK THE WHOLE LAW NEEDS TO BE 
AND PROBABLY WILL BE 
WELL I HOPE SO 
YES 
COLUMBUS OHIO LAST CALL FOR SENATORS HEFLIN AND BROWN AND THEN ALAN HELLO 
YES I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOUR TWO SENATORS IF THEY HAVE SUCH HIGH STANDARDS FOR ZOE BAIRD WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO ABOUT MR. SESSIONS OF THE F. B. I. AND HIS ETHICS 
MR. SESSIONS 
WELL I THINK EVERYBODY'S GOT SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT JUDGE SESSIONS AND ALL OF THE THINGS IF THEY'RE TRUE 
NOW HE HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY YET TO PRESENT HIS SIDE 
IF TRUE 
IF 
SHOULD HE LEAVE THE F. B. I. 
WELL IF THEY'RE ALL TRUE YES I THINK SO 
CAN YOU FORCE HIM OUT 
WELL HE HAS A TEN YEAR APPOINTMENT AND I HAD LOOKED INTO THE METHOD 
IT WOULD BE LARGELY UP TO THE PRESIDENT I BELIEVE 
AND THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL RIGHT 
WELL THE PRESIDENT I THINK 
HE WORKS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
I THINK IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL SENATOR BROWN IF THE CHARGES ABOUT MR. SESSIONS WERE TRUE 
WELL THE OLD ATTORNEY GENERAL ISSUED A VERY STRONG REPRIMAND IN VERY DIRECT LANGUAGE INDICATED HE'D NOT ONLY BEEN OUT OF BOUNDS BUT THAT IT APPARENTLY HAD BEEN SOMETHING OF A GROSS ABUSE AND TOTALLY WITH AN EXPLANATION 
CLEARLY HE HAS TO SET AN EXAMPLE TOO 
YOUR CALLER FROM OHIO MAKES A VERY SOLID POINT 
I SUSPECT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS QUESTION REVIEWED 
ALL RIGHT LAST CALL QUICKLY COLORADO 
HELLO 
YES SENATOR BROWN HAVEN'T YOU AND VIRTUALLY EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS VIOLATED THE LAW BY HIRING A BABYSITTER AND PAYING HER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS AT A QUARTER AND FAILING TO FILE A W. FOUR FORM AND FAILING TO PAY SOCIAL SECURITY TAX 
DID YOU EVER DO THAT HANK 
WELL IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE SINCE WE'VE HAD CHILDREN OF THE AGE WHERE YOU'D HAVE A BABYSITTER SO I DON'T THINK SO 
BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL MADE 
MY GUESS IS THE THRESHOLD IS SO LOW NOW WITH THE CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE VIOLATED IT 
ALSO YOU WEREN'T APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL 
A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY HAVE 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH 
THANKS SENATOR 
ALL RIGHT 
THANK YOU LARRY 
THANKS HANK
