HUNDREDS OF WOMEN VETERANS HAVE GATHERED AT FORT MCCLELLAN ALABAMA TO MARK A MILESTONE THIS YEAR MARKING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WOMEN'S ARMY CORPS 
C. N. N.'S PAT ETHERIDGE HAS MORE ON THAT AND THE CHANGING ROLES OF WOMEN IN THE MILITARY 
THESE ARE THE FACES OF PIONEERS THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMEN TO MARCH OFF TO WAR 
YOU GO BACK AND YOU THINK WELL THAT WAS A KIND OF A HARD THING THAT WE WERE ASKED TO DO BUT IT WAS REALLY WORTHWHILE ACCOMPLISHING IT 
THE YEAR WAS NINETEEN FORTY TWO AND WHEN THE ARMY CALLED THE WOMEN ANSWERED FOR REASONS PATRIOTIC AND PRAGMATIC 
ALL THE MEN WENT AWAY THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD CATCH UP WITH IS GOING YOURSELF 
FIFTY YEARS LATER THEY'VE GATHERED FOR A LOOK BACK FADED PHOTOGRAPHS AND A CHANCE TO RENEW COMMON BONDS 
THEY ARE WOMEN WHO WEREN'T BORN YESTERDAY AND STAND READY TO SERVE UNTIL THEIR DYING DAY 
TAKE MARY WHO AT EIGHTY FIVE ACHED TO BE A PART OF DESERT STORM 
AT EIGHTY FIVE OF COURSE THE ARMY WAS NOT READY TO RECEIVE ME BUT BELIEVE ME IF THEY WERE READY I WOULD'VE BEEN ON THE OTHER END OF THAT STICK 
IT'S THE KIND OF SPIRIT THAT KEPT THEM ALIVE AS ARMY NURSES HELD CAPTIVE IN THE PHILIPPINES 
ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T CARRY WEAPONS THEY WERE IN HARM'S WAY 
THEY WERE IN NORTH AFRICA AND CHINA INDIA BURMA AUSTRALIA 
SOME OF THEM WERE IN LONDON DURING THE BUZZ BOMBING AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE SHOOTING THE GUNS BUT THEY WERE THERE AND THEY WERE IN HARM'S WAY 
IT'S THE KIND OF SPIRIT THAT CARRIED THROUGH THE KOREAN WAR VIETNAM 
THE KIND OF SPIRIT THAT INSPIRES THE SOLDIERS OF MODERN DAY 
THE WOMEN'S ARMY CORPS WAS DISCONTINUED AS A SEPARATE ENTITY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
NOW THEY'RE NO LONGER CALLED SIMPLY SOLDIERS 
WITH EVERY CONFLICT THEIR ROLE GROWS MORE CRUCIAL 
ONCE YOU GET OUT THERE AND YOU START PERFORMING YOUR MISSION YOU'LL FIND WOMEN ANYWHERE ON THE BATTLEFIELD 
AND ON THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WOMEN'S ARMY CORPS THE YOUNG EXPRESS THEIR AWE 
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE A HUNDRED WAR STORIES TO TELL APIECE 
I THINK THEY PAVED THE WAY FOR US WOMEN OF TODAY 
THEY REALLY SET A STANDARD THAT SAID YOU KNOW WE CAN DO IT 
AND SO TODAY THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST WOMEN WARRIORS MARCHES ON
