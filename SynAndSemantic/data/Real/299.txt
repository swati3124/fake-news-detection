IN CHICAGO AIR TRAVELERS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WHAT FLIGHTS THEY DON'T FIND CANCELED ARE BEING DELAYED 
C. N. N.'S JEFF FLOCK IS OUT IN THE ELEMENTS AND HE'S FOUND PERHAPS THE ONE SPOT IN CHICAGO WHERE IT'S NOT ONLY SAFE TO SLIDE BUT IT'S EXPECTED AT LEAST DURING THE SUMMER TIME 
JEFF 
YOU STOLE MY LINE BOBBIE 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S COLD WINDY WET 
PERHAPS YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE FOG ON OUR LENS 
THAT'S HOW COLD AND WINDY AND WET IT IS IN CHICAGO TODAY BUT WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM A SPOT THAT MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN IN WARMER TIMES 
I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU SEE THE IVY OUT THERE 
YES THAT IS WRIGLEY FIELD CHICAGO AND TODAY YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK OF JUST ABOUT ANY SEAT IN THE BALL PARK 
INDEED A WINTER STORM IS BEARING DOWN ON CHICAGO 
IT'S HERE 
IT'S BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE 
OUTSIDE THE BALL PARK PERHAPS YOU CAN SEE THE SCENE 
ALL OF CHICAGO LOOKS LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW AND I'M JOINED BY FRANK WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF TICKET OPERATIONS FOR THE CHICAGO CUBS 
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK OF ANY SEAT TODAY FRANK 
WELL YOU SURE CAN 
OF COURSE MOST OF OUR ADVANCE FORCES ARE OUT IN PHOENIX TODAY IN SPRING TRAINING 
WE'RE THE OCCUPATION ARMY RIGHT HERE 
NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO AS WE'RE TALKING HERE FRANK WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND SHOW SOME FOLKS WHAT THIS BALL PARK LOOKS LIKE 
THIS WINTER WE THOUGHT WAS DONE 
WELL WE DID TOO 
LAST FRIDAY WE OPENED UP TICKET SALES FOR THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SEASON 
IT WAS A BALMY SIXTY DEGREES HERE 
IT WAS GREAT BUT NOW WE'VE GONE BACK INTO THE TANK 
BUT WE STILL HAVE SIX WEEKS AHEAD OF US UNTIL OPENING DAY HERE ON APRIL FOURTH 
NOW YOU KNOW CHICAGO VERY WELL 
WE THOUGHT LAST WEEK IT WAS WARM IT WAS SUNNY SPRING WAS HERE 
WELL IT'S NOT OVER YET 
WE'VE ACTUALLY PLAYED HERE IN THE SNOW IN APRIL 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT OF SNOW WHILE WE WERE PLAYING 
SO THE CHICAGO WEATHER WILL BE VERY FICKLE FOR ANOTHER SIX WEEKS 
AND YOU HAD A FOOTBALL YOU USED TO PLAY FOOTBALL HERE I KNOW 
WELL THE CHICAGO BEARS USED TO PLAY HERE 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WAS STAGED HERE AGAINST THE NEW YORK GIANTS AND THE BEARS WON ON A DAY NOT TOO DISSIMILAR FROM THIS 
LOOKS LIKE KIND OF A BEARS GREEN BAY KIND OF A THING OUT THERE 
THAT'S IT 
IT'S THAT'S TYPICAL BEAR WEATHER 
ALL RIGHT 
A SPECIAL LOOK HERE OF A LITTLE BIT OF CHICAGO AS YOU SEE FOLKS OUTSIDE THERE IN THE SNOW OUTSIDE THE BALL PARK AND WE'RE IN THE BEST SPOT INSIDE THE BALL PARK AS THE SNOW AND FOG MOUNTS ON OUR LENS 
THAT'S IT FOR NOW 
WE'LL BE BACK A LITTLE LATER AND LET YOU KNOW HOW IT ALL TURNS OUT
