MR. CLINTON ADDRESSES THE UNITED NATIONS LATER TODAY 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY HE IS EXPECTED TO APPEAL FOR TOUGHER MEASURES TO STOP THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TO CALL FOR BETTER ORGANIZATION OF U. N. PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS 
C. N. N. PLANS LIVE COVERAGE OF THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK A. M. 
EASTERN TIME 
PRESIDENT CLINTON IS THE FIRST OF MANY HEADS OF STATE SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE U. N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY AS ITS NEW SESSION GETS UNDERWAY 
C. N. N.'S JEANNE MOOS TELLS US WHAT'S AHEAD FOR THE WORLD BODY 
WHEN THEY ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET AND A BOMB DOG WALKS DOWN IT WHEN YOU SEE MEN WITH BINOCULARS ON THE ROOF AND YOU SEE DIPLOMATS KISSING SHAKING HANDS PATTING EACH OTHER ON THE BACK YOU KNOW THE U. N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS BACK TO ORDER LIKE KIDS ON THEIR FIRST DAY BACK AT SCHOOL 
IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS FORTY OR SO WORLD LEADERS AND OVER ONE HUNDRED FOREIGN MINISTERS WILL TAKE TURNS PARADING TO THE PODIUM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE NEW PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN 
THIS SO CALLED GENERAL DEBATE HAS ITS OCCASIONAL MOMENTS OF KEEN INTEREST AND LONG SPELLS OF REPETITION BOREDOM AND INCREDIBLY RHETORIC 
IT'S ENOUGH TO FOND MEMORIES OF THE MOMENT OF SILENCE THAT OPENED THIS SESSION LAST WEEK 
WHEN THE SECRETARY GENERAL WAS ASKED WHAT THE MAIN ISSUE OF THIS ASSEMBLY SESSION WOULD BE HE ANSWERED FINANCE FINANCE U. S. AND RUSSIA OWE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
THE U. N. CAN BARELY ISSUE PAYCHECKS 
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WITH ISRAEL AND THE P. L. O. SHAKING HANDS RATHER THAN FISTS WITH APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA ON ITS WAY OUT THERE'S AN EVEN GREATER SENSE OF CONSENSUS IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
THERE IS A CERTAIN CIVILITY AMONG EVEN LONG TIME 
A CIVILITY THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS EXTEND TO THE PRESS 
THE DAILY PRESS BRIEFINGS HAVE BECOME TESTY EVER SINCE THE U. N. DRASTICALLY TIGHTENED SECURITY IN THE WAKE OF AN ALLEGED BOMB PLOT 
A SOMEWHAT LESS THAN DIPLOMATIC SUGGESTION THAT SECURITY HAS BEEN LAX IN THE PAST 
I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY'RE ONLY A GROUP OF CLOWNS WHO CAN'T DO THEIR JOBS PROPERLY 
MET WITH AN ICY STARE FROM THE U. N. SPOKESMAN 
JOURNALISTS CAN NO LONGER BRING VISITORS TO THE U. N. PUBLIC TOUR OF THE BUILDING HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR FEAR THAT TOURISTS COULD ROAM TOO FREELY 
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU 
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
I DON'T KNOW 
A TOUR GUIDE WITH NO GUIDANCE 
THE U. N. IS CREDENTIALS BOLSTERING BARRIERS REPORTEDLY REINFORCES PILLARS AND CEILINGS IN THE PARKING AREA BENEATH THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HALL IN CASE A BOMB EVER WENT OFF 
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF PARANOIA IT'S A QUESTION THAT THIS BUILDING HAS BEEN THREATENED 
SO WAS THIS CAR ACCIDENTALLY BY GATES GONE AMOK 
IS THAT WHAT THEY MEAN BY TIGHT SECURITY
