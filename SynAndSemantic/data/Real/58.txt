AS POVERTY DRUGS AND CRIME INVADE FAMILIES MORE CHILDREN FACE PARENTS WHO CANNOT OR WILL NOT CARE FOR THEM 
THIS OFTEN MEANS MOVING TO A FOSTER CARE FACILITY 
C. N. N.'S GARY TUCHMAN REPORTS ON ONE SUCH CENTER IN UPSTATE NEW YORK 
THE SETTING IN THE SMALL TOWN OF FERRY NEW YORK IS PEACEFUL QUITE A CONTRAST FOR CHILDREN WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT PEACEFUL 
THIS IS THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE WHERE BOYS FROM AGE FIVE TO SIXTEEN WHO NO LONGER LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES ARE LIVING FOR THE TIME BEING 
THE FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN ARE LIVING HERE RUN THE ENTIRE GAMUT FROM THOSE WHO ARE REALLY LOVING CARING OFTEN OVERWHELMED PARENTS TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY ABUSIVE AND DAMAGING TO THEIR CHILDREN 
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD COREY FATHER WAS MURDERED WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG BOY 
AFTER YEARS OF AGGRESSIVE IMPULSIVE AND SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR COREY SPENT TIME IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION BEFORE COMING TO THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE 
AND THINGS HAVE BRIGHTENED CONSIDERABLY FOR COREY 
AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF SPECIAL CLASSES COUNSELING RECREATION AND COMPASSION AT THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE HE HAS NEW OUTLOOK ON LIFE 
NOW THAT YOU SEE ALL THE KIDS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH YOU HAD BUT THEY'RE IT KIND OF MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THE STUFF YOU DID BEFORE 
COREY IS LUCKY 
UNLIKE MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS HE HAS A MOTHER HOPING TO SOON TAKE HIM HOME 
THEY JUST DON'T PUT THE KIDS IN HERE AND THROW THE KEY LOCK THEN UP AND THAT'S IT 
NO THEY HELP THE CHILDREN WITH THEIR PROBLEMS 
THEY ALSO GIVE THE CHILDREN A SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT AND PRIDE 
THE ANNUAL CIRCUS IN WHICH THE CHILDREN GET TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EVENTS IS PREPARED FOR AND LOOKED FORWARD TO FOR WEEKS IN ADVANCE 
BUT FOR MOST OF THE KIDS NOTHING IS LOOKED FORWARD TO MORE THAN BEING TOLD THEY GO BACK HOME 
AND AFTER YEARS OF BEING AWAY COREY HAD JUST RECEIVED THE GOOD NEWS 
NOT ALL THE CHILDREN HERE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT THUMBS UP 
SOME BECAUSE OF CONTINUED BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OTHERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE PARENTS WHO DON'T WANT THEM BACK 
FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE THOSE KINDS OF RESULTS MAY BREAK THEIR HEARTS BUT THEY CAN'T ALLOW IT TO BREAK THEIR SPIRITS 
AFTER ALL THERE'S A LOT MORE GOOD WORK THEY STILL NEED TO DO
