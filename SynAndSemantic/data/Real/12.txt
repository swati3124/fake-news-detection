A MYSTERY IN NEW JERSEY 
IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A WEEK SINCE EXXON INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT SIDNEY DISAPPEARED WHILE HEADING FOR WORK 
NOW THE PICTURE'S BEEN CLOUDED BY UNCONFIRMED REPORTS MAY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORISM 
RICHARD ROTH HAS THE STORY 
AFTER A VIRTUAL INFORMATION BLACKOUT ON THE FATE OF SIDNEY PRESIDENT OF EXXON INTERNATIONAL LOCAL PROSECUTORS CALLED A NEWS CONFERENCE 
EARLIER THE NEW YORK POST REPORTED THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAID WAS KIDNAPPED BY A GROUP CALLING ITSELF RAINBOW WARRIORS RAISING SPECULATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORISM 
THE PAPER SAID A RANSOM NOTE AND PHONE CALLS WERE RECEIVED 
BUT THE MORRIS COUNTY PROSECUTOR WOULD TAKE NO QUESTIONS ISSUING A STATEMENT THE HEART OF WHICH DEALT WITH THE POST KIDNAP STORY 
AND IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS OFFICE TO DISCUSS THAT REPORT OF A COMMUNICATION IN THE ABSENCE OF VERIFICATION THAT THE COMMUNICATION IS INDEED FROM AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP HOLDING MR. IN CUSTODY 
ABSENT A CURRENT PHOTOGRAPH OR A VOICE RECORDING THIS OFFICE CANNOT REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT MR. IS IN THE CUSTODY OF ANY PARTICULAR GROUP 
NOT AN OUTRIGHT DENIAL OF THE STORY PLUS A COMMENT HINTING THAT FURTHER COMMUNICATION IS NEEDED IF IS BEING HELD BY ANYONE 
DISAPPEARED APRIL TWENTY NINTH AS HE LEFT HIS SUBURBAN MORRIS TOWNSHIP HOME 
HIS CAR WAS FOUND IN THE DRIVEWAY 
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN TIGHT LIPPED AND IN THE WAKE OF THE POST STORY THE PROSECUTOR HAD A WARNING FOR THE MEDIA 
FURTHERMORE WE BELIEVE IT TO BE ILL ADVISED FOR ANY MEDIA ORGANIZATION TO PUBLISH AND UNIDENTIFIED SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT A MATTER WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S WELL BEING 
EXXON SAID IT WOULD HAVE NO COMMENT ON THE CASE NEITHER WOULD THE F. B. I. 
SO THE MYSTERY CONTINUES WITH THE AUTHORITIES SEEMINGLY LOOKING TO HEAR FROM PERSON OR PERSONS WHO MIGHT BE HOLDING THE EXXON EXECUTIVE
