HUNDREDS OF WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS SPENT THIS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND IN STYLE 
THE BOARDED THE OCEAN LINER AND THEY EMBARKED THIS AFTERNOON FROM NEW YORK HARBOR ON THEIR WAY TO NORMANDY FRANCE AND THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATION OF D. DAY 
DURING THE D. DAY INVASION THE WAS NO COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT LOST MORE YOUNG MEN PER CAPITA THAN THE SMALL TOWN OF BEDFORD VIRGINIA 
A. B. C.'S MIKE VON FREMD PAID A VISIT AND FOUND THAT MEMORIES ARE STILL VIVID AND THE LOSS IS STILL DEEP 
THE OLD TIMERS SAY BEDFORD LOOKS MUCH THE SAME TODAY AS IT DID FIFTY YEARS AGO 
SOME OF THE STOREFRONT NAMES HAVE CHANGED SUNNY VITAMINS USED TO BE THE WESTERN UNION BOOTH 
THIS IS WHERE ONE FAMILY AFTER ANOTHER WOULD RECEIVE OFFICIAL WORD OF THE TRAGIC NEWS 
I WAS WORKING WITH MY SISTER THAT DAY AND SHE SAW THE MAN WHEN HE STARTED TOWARD ME WITH THE TELEGRAM AND SHE MOTIONED HIM BACK 
THE TELEGRAM SAID MASTER SERGEANT JOHN WILKES WAS KILLED IN ACTION ON D. DAY 
HE HAD BEEN MARRIED TO LESS THAN THREE YEARS 
HIS DEATH WAS FRONT PAGE NEWS HERE 
THE WHOLE PAPERS WERE JUST FULL OF PICTURES OF OUR BEDFORD MEN THAT HAD BEEN KILLED 
AND I REMEMBER SAYING TO MY SISTER WELL THEY HAVE JUST KILLED THEM ALL 
NINETEEN BEDFORD MEN WERE KILLED ON OMAHA BEACH ON D. DAY A STAGGERING LOSS FOR A COMMUNITY OF LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
WE WERE GETTING READY TO GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING AND THE SHERIFF BROUGHT OUT THE FIRST TELEGRAM SAYING MY OLDER BROTHER BEDFORD HAD BEEN KILLED 
AND THEN THE FOLLOWING DAY ON MONDAY WE RECEIVED A SECOND TELEGRAM SAYING MY YOUNGER BROTHER RAYMOND WAS MISSING IN ACTION 
BEDFORD HAS BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE COST 
AND THE LOSS OF LIFE IN THIS SMALL COMMUNITY HAD AN IMPACT ON THE NATION 
THE MILITARY CHANGED ITS POLICY OF GROUPING LARGE NUMBERS OF MEN FROM THE SAME HOMETOWN IN THE SAME UNIT 
THE BEDFORD MEN WHO DIED WERE ALL FROM COMPANY A AN UNTESTED VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD UNIT THAT WAS PROUD TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO BE THE FIRST TO HIT THE BEACHES 
WE WENT OVER THE REGULARS TO BE CHOSEN TO HIT ON THE BEACH 
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GREAT HONOR 
COMPANY A SUFFERED A NINETY SIX PERCENT CASUALTY RATE 
THAT DAY WAS A TERRIBLE DAY 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST DAYS I'VE EVER SPENT IN MY LIFE 
ROY STEVENS LOST HIS TWIN BROTHER RAY AND SAYS THE ONLY REASON HIS LIFE WAS SPARED WAS BECAUSE HIS BOAT SANK BEFORE IT REACHED THE BEACH 
I FEEL LIKE THAT ALL THOSE BOYS DIED THAT DAY IT WASN'T FOR NOTHING 
IT WASN'T FOR 
THEY DIED FOR A PURPOSE 
AND THAT'S THE REASON YOU AND I ARE HERE TODAY TO MAINTAIN THAT FREEDOM 
IT MADE US ALL REALIZE WHAT WAR IS ABOUT 
AND I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY THAT BEDFORD WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED FOR THE LIVES THAT THEY GAVE 
OF THE NINETEEN MEN THAT WERE KILLED DURING THE INVASION THIRTEEN WERE LAID TO REST IN NORMANDY 
THE OTHER SIX ARE BURIED HERE OVERLOOKING THIS TOWN THAT FELT THE LOSS OF D. DAY MORE DEARLY THAN ANY COMMUNITY IN AMERICA
