MAKE MORE ROOM FOR POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ROSS PEROT 
HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE PRESENTED A OF PETITIONS TO SECURE HIM A SPOT ON THE TEXAS BALLOT 
ON THOSE PETITIONS SOME TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIGNATURES THAT'S FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER NEEDED 
MORE FROM C. N. N.'S MIKE CAPPS 
PEROT FOLLOWERS TURNED AN AUSTIN PARK INTO A MINI CONVENTION SITE 
BUS LOADS OF ENTHUSIASTIC VOLUNTEERS ARRIVED FROM DALLAS 
VOLUNTEERS DISPLAYED ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF A DEVELOPING POLITICAL CAMPAIGN 
PEROT'S NAME ALREADY IS ON THE BALLOT IN TENNESSEE AND UTAH 
A PLACE ON THE BALLOT IN HIS HOME STATE IS CRITICAL 
I THINK IT SHOWS WHAT THE VOLUNTEERS CAN DO AND THE WILLPOWER OF THE PEOPLE TO GET BEHIND ROSS PEROT 
SINCE LATE FEBRUARY THOSE VOLUNTEERS OBTAINED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SIGNATURES FROM TEXAS VOTERS 
A TEXAS SIZE STEP TOWARD A SPOT ON THE BALLOT MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES NEEDED SIGNATURES COMING FROM MANY VOTERS UPSET WITH THE CURRENT U. S. POLITICAL CLIMATE 
WE NEED A CHANGE AND I THINK THE COUNTRY DEFINITELY NEEDS A CHANGE 
WE NEED A REPRESENTATIVE FOR US THAT'S GOING TO HELP US GET OUR DESIRES AND NEEDS MET 
ROSS PEROT FROM ALL I CAN GATHER IS AN HONEST MAN AND I BELIEVE WE'D HAVE AN HONEST GOVERNMENT 
THE CELEBRATION CONTINUED AS VOLUNTEERS LOADED PETITIONS ONTO TEXAS SIZE FLATBED TRAILERS 
PEROT'S PARADED THROUGH AUSTIN STREETS TOWARD THE STATE CAPITOL 
ON THE CAPITOL STEPS THEY PRESENTED THE PETITIONS TO THE TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR VALIDATION 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO QUIT QUIT TODAY 
NO 
OKAY 
PEROT HAS SAID HE'LL MAKE FEWER PERSONAL APPEARANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS CONCENTRATING ON DEVELOPING POLICY POSITIONS 
BUT HERE HE MADE AN EXCEPTION 
BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE LIKE YOU WE CAN BUILD A NATION THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD LOOKS UP TO THAT WILL BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND KINDNESS NOT ONLY HERE BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WITHIN TWO TO FOUR WEEKS SIGNATURES SHOULD BE VALIDATED AND PEROT'S NAME PLACED ON THE TEXAS BALLOTS 
HIS STAFF CALLS THIS A VICTORY ONE GIVING ROSS PEROT MOMENTUM AS HE TRIES TO GET ON THE BALLOT IN FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES
