ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER A SIMI VALLEY JURY ACQUITTED THE FOUR POLICE OFFICERS THE RIOTING BEGAN 
DONNA IS A TRANSPLANT TO LOS ANGELES FROM WASHINGTON D. C. AND SHE RECALLS THAT DAY WELL 
AS THE T. V. IMAGES FLOODED MY EYES IT ALL SEEMED SO UNREAL 
GIL SCOTT HERON WAS WRONG 
THE REVOLUTION WAS BEING TELEVISED AND IT WAS LIVE 
I SAT IN HORROR AND WATCHED THE CITY I LOVE GO UP IN FLAMES AIDED AND BY A PRESS CORPS GONE WILD 
PIERCING THROUGH THIS RIVER OF EMOTION AND IMAGES ECHOED THE REPEATED REMARKS OF THE NEWS COMMENTATORS 
WHY ARE THEY LOOTING DON'T THEY HAVE ANY VALUES WHO ARE THEY I SAT IN AGREEMENT UNTIL I REALIZED THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ME 
YOU SEE I TOO AM A 
I REFER TO A TIME OF LOVE BEADS FREE HUEY AND PURPLE HAZE TO THE RELIGION OF MY YOUTH 
ON THAT BLEAK NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT APRIL MORNING I STOOD IN FROZEN SILENCE WITH MY FELLOW HOWARD UNIVERSITY CLASSMATES 
STEPPED TO THE MICROPHONE RAISED A PISTOL HIGH IN THE AIR AND SCREAMED THEY'VE KILLED OUR KING MARTIN LUTHER KING 
THE REVOLUTION HAS WE SCRAMBLED INTO THE STREETS OF D. C. WITH NO PARTICULAR AGENDA 
WE RAN TO KILL THE PAIN OF OUR ANCESTORS AND THE BURDEN OF OUR IMPENDING ADULTHOOD 
WE'D ALREADY BEEN LOOTED AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT 
AN INSIDE SIXTIES REVOLUTIONARY JOKE WAS ONE NEVER STOLE ANYTHING BUT RATHER ONE LIBERATED IT. SO I FREED SOME BOTTLES OF JOHNNY WALKER RED PINK WIGS SIZE FIFTY D. BRAS AND OTHER WORTHLESS GOODS 
WE WERE ABLE TO SET THE TONE OF THE DAY 
IT WAS A POWERFUL FEELING SOMETHING I'VE NEVER FELT SINCE 
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF BLACKS WE SPEND OUR LIVES OPERATING IN VERY PRESCRIBED WAYS BUT ON THIS DAY SOME OF US GOT DRUNK FROM A SENSE OF POWER 
MY EARLY YEARS IN L. A. WERE CONSUMED WITH CRASHING INTO THE MOVIE SYSTEM AND LIVING A DREAMY MUSICAL EXISTENCE 
ALL THAT CHANGED WHEN DUVALL A COLLEGE FRIEND ESCORTED ME HOME TO WEST HOLLYWOOD AFTER A NIGHT OF HEADY INTELLECTUAL DEBATE 
AS WE PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY I HEARD THE CLICKING OF SIX RIOT GUNS FELT THE HEAT OF SPOTLIGHTS AND HEARD THE VOICE GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP 
THE OFFICERS FORCED DUVALL TO THE GROUND AND ME AGAINST THE CAR 
AFTER THEY RELEASED US ONE OFFICER JUSTIFIED THE ATTACK BECAUSE TWO BLACK HAD KIDNAPPED AN ELDERLY WHITE WOMAN 
ONCE MORE WE WERE LOOTED OF OUR HUMANITY 
AND AS I WATCHED THE LOOTERS ON T. V. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO I NOTED THAT BLACK COLLEGE ENROLLMENT IS DECLINING AND WE'RE MOVING OVER FOR YET ANOTHER WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS 
IN A SPLIT SECOND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO THROW A STONE AT THE LOOTERS OR QUESTION THEIR MOTIVES 
I KNEW THE ANSWER AS I UNDERSTOOD IT TWO WEEKS AGO AS EVERYONE WAITED WITH BAITED BREATH TO SEE IF L. A. WOULD EXPLODE AGAIN 
WITHOUT A STRONG ACTIVE NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO INCLUDE ALL OF US IN THE AMERICAN DREAM WE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS OF LOOTERS 
WITHOUT TOTAL PASSION IN THE END THEY YOU AND I REMAIN LOOTERS
