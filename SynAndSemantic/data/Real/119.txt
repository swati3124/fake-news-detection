WELL PAYING THE COST OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION HAS NEVER BEEN EASY AND NOW EVEN A GOVERNMENT COMMISSION SAYS THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM NEEDS FIXING 
C. N. N.'S PAUL VERCAMMEN REPORTS 
THE HIGH COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY STUDENT OR PARENT FEEL HARD HIT 
THERE MUST BE LIKE A BETTER WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE 
AND THE RED TAPE OF APPLYING FOR MULTIPLE LOANS AND GRANTS COULD GIVE YOU WRITER'S 
PEOPLE BEGIN TO THINK IT'S LIKE DOING INCOME TAXES YOU KNOW 
I'VE GOT TO GO HIRE SOME PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR ME 
THE DREAM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS A NIGHTMARE FOR MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES 
ON WEDNESDAY AFTER TWO YEARS OF STUDY A BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION MADE RECOMMENDATIONS IT HOPES WILL HELP 
THE COMMISSION WANTS ALL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR AN AID PACKAGE UP TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MORE GRANTS TO POORER STUDENTS MORE LOANS FOR THOSE WHO CAN PAY 
TO MAKE LOAN REPAYMENT LESS BURDENSOME THE OPTION OF PAYING BACK WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE 
AND TO ALLOW PARENTS TO DIG DEEPER FOR FUNDS THE COMMISSION WANTS TAX BREAKS FOR COLLEGE RELATED I. R. A. WITHDRAWALS AND SAVINGS BONDS 
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF AMERICA CANNOT GET INTO COLLEGE RIGHT NOW UNLESS THEY ARE TERRIBLY POOR OR TERRIBLY RICH 
MY GRANDPARENTS THEIR WAY OF PASSING THEIR INHERITANCE ON TO ME IS TO PAY FOR MY EDUCATION 
AND SO OUR FAMILY EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT SO MY GRANDPARENTS PAY FOR ME 
BUT RIGHT NOW SOME SAY GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS TERRIBLY POOR AND THEY WONDER WHERE IT WILL DIG UP SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THE PLAN 
WE CAN AFFORD TO DO SOME OF IT 
I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANYBODY THE IMPRESSION WE CAN AFFORD TO DO ALL OF IT 
SO LIKE MANY AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS STRUGGLING ON A TIGHT BUDGET CONGRESS MAY HAVE TO COMPROMISE ITS AMBITIOUS EDUCATION PLAN
