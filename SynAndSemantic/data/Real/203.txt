C. N. N.'S RICHARD BLYSTONE REPORTS 
YOU WIN SOME YOU LOSE SOME SOMEBODY CALLED OUT TO JOHN MAJOR AS THE BAD NEWS WAS DELIVERED THURSDAY NIGHT 
TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER INTENDS TO WIN SOME BY PUTTING HIS JOB ON THE LINE AND EARLY REACTIONS INDICATE THE RISK WILL PAY OFF 
THAT THE TORY PARTY'S GOING TO STICK TOGETHER LIKE GLUE 
IF HE LOSES MAJOR SAYS HE'LL CALL NATIONAL ELECTIONS AND WITH THE CONSERVATIVES RUNNING THIRD IN THE OPINION POLLS HE CAN HOPE THAT THE SURVIVAL INSTINCT AMONG TWO DOZEN EURO REBELS WILL OVERWHELM THEIR OBJECTIONS TO EUROPEAN UNION 
THE TREATY OF MAASTRICHT WHICH IS GOING TO BE RATIFIED WHATEVER THE RESULT TODAY 
PRIME MINISTER 
TEMPERS ARE STILL RAW AFTER THURSDAY NIGHT'S DEBATE BUT IF MAJOR HANDLES THIS ONE RIGHT HE COULD RESTORE SOME OF THE AUTHORITY HE'S LOST IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS
