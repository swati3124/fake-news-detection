LABOR NEWS AT HOME 
FIRST IT WAS FORD NOW CHRYSLER HAS REACHED A CONTRACT AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION 
NO DETAILS PRECISELY BUT LIKE FORD'S IT IS SAID TO INCLUDE A SMALL WAGE INCREASE AND NO REDUCTION IN HEALTH BENEFITS 
THAT LEAVES GENERAL MOTORS WHICH IS IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BIG THREE 
IF YOU FILLED UP AT THE GAS STATION TODAY YOU CAN SURELY RELATE TO THE NEXT STORY 
LAST SPRING CONGRESS VOTED TO RAISE THE TAX ON GASOLINE TO HELP REDUCE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT NOT MUCH ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE DRIVER 
THAT INCREASE WENT INTO EFFECT TODAY AND A. B. C.'S BOB JAMIESON HAS BEEN LISTENING TO THE REACTION AT THE PUMPS 
AS THIS SIMPLE ACT WAS REPEATED AT GAS STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT GOT THE ATTENTION OF MOTORISTS THAT WEEKS OF CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE HAD NOT 
PUMP PRICES REFLECTED THE FOUR POINT THREE CENT INCREASE WHICH NOW MAKES THE TOTAL FEDERAL TAX ON A GALLON OF GASOLINE EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR CENTS 
THEY SEEM TO ALWAYS GOT TO GAS TAXES TO RAISE MONEY AND I'M JUST TIRED OF PAYING IT 
THEY ALWAYS SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER THING WITH THE MONEY YOU KNOW 
BUT IT'S STILL HURTING ME 
THAT'S THE FIRST ONE CLINTON GOT 
HE AIN'T STOPPING THERE 
HE'S GONNA KEEP GOING ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AS LONG AS CONGRESS GOES ALONG WITH HIM 
THE LOUDEST COMPLAINTS CAME FROM TRUCKERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO OWN AND OPERATE THEIR RIGS 
THE INCREASE WILL COST THEM AT LEAST A THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE A YEAR 
WHEN YOU RAISE OUR FUEL TAXES THAT COMES OUT OF OUR POCKET AND WE CAN'T CHARGE IT BACK TO THE CUSTOMER 
IT'S GOTTEN TOTALLY OUT OF HAND WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY ANYMORE WE'RE RUNNING OURSELVES TO DEATH 
ANOTHER COLD BLOW TO TRUCKERS ONE MORE TIME 
BUT IN MANY PLACES EVEN WHERE THE LOCAL GASOLINE TAXES ARE AS MUCH OR MORE THAN THE FEDERAL TAX THERE WAS GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE OF THE INCREASE 
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME STOP DRIVING MY CAR OR THINK I'M NOT GOING TO AND THAT'S THE WAY TAXES WORK 
WELL IF IT'S REALLY GOING TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT I REALLY DON'T MIND 
I THINK WE CAN WELL AFFORD FOUR POINT THREE CENTS A GALLON OF GASOLINE 
I THINK GASOLINE PRICES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE MORE THAN REASONABLE 
IN FACT EVEN WITH THE TAX INCREASE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE TODAY IS LOWER THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
BOB JAMIESON A. B. C. NEWS NEW YORK 
THERE IS A SIGN TODAY THAT THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL IS PICKING UP AFTER A VERY SLUGGISH FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR 
THE GOVERNMENT'S INDEX OF LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS WHICH SIGNALS FUTURE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES SCORED ITS BEST GAIN OF THE YEAR IN AUGUST 
IT WAS UP ONE PERCENT 
THAT HELPED SEND WALL STREET HIGHER TODAY 
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS GAINED NEARLY TWENTY SIX POINTS TO CLOSE AT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE 
THE TRADING WAS HEAVY AND FOR THE WEEK STOCKS GAINED THIRTY EIGHT POINTS 
WELL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION TO PUT LIFE INTO A GOVERNMENT BRIEFING 
THAT'S THE LABOR SECRETARY ROBERT REICH TALKING TO REPORTERS ABOUT SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE 
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S LOGO RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD 
ONE BIG ISSUE HAS BEEN UNCLEAR AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF HOW THINGS FALL I MEAN THERE MAY BE A WORKPLACE INJURY PROBLEM RIGHT HERE IF I'M NOT CAREFUL 
A FEW SECONDS LATER THE BUILDING'S FIRE ALARM SOUNDED 
THE SECRETARY LED THE REPORTERS SAFELY DOWN TO THE STREET 
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM
