HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE IN THE NEXT HOUR 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE LURID STORIES ABOUT VICTIMS AND KILLERS 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LENGTHY DEBATE ABOUT GUN CONTROL 
YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THESE THE GUNS THAT FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THINGS YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE 
THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION GUNS IN AMERICA 
THAT'S ALMOST ONE WEAPON FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD 
NOW ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM ACTUALLY FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS BUT WHEN THEY DO THE RESULTS ARE DEVASTATING 
IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THAT'S THE LAST YEAR STATISTICS ARE AVAILABLE GUNS WERE USED IN SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND CRIMES 
TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHO MAKES THOSE GUNS WHO BUYS THEM WHO SELLS THEM AND WHY IT IS THAT TODAY ANYBODY CAN GET ONE 
WE BEGIN INSIDE A MASSACHUSETTS PRISON WHERE MICHEL MCQUEEN TALKED WITH THE EXPERTS WHO WANTED US TO UNDERSTAND THE ALLURE AND THE COST OF A LIFE UNDER THE GUN 
A GUN MAKES YOU SOMEBODY 
YOU CAN MAKE IT SO SOMEBODY LIVES THE NEXT DAY OR YOU CAN TAKE SOMEBODY'S LIFE SO THEY DON'T LIVE THE NEXT DAY AND THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL INSIDE OF YOU IT'S IT'S A RUSH YOU GET OUT OF IT 
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH A GUN 
YOU SEE IT ON TELEVISION YOU SEE IT ON THE NEWS 
IT'S BACK TO THE WILD WILD WEST 
YOU KNOW I WAS FASCINATED BY THE GUN 
IT WAS LIKE PUTTING ON MY PANTS IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW 
AND IT WAS PART OF MY WARDROBE HAVING THIS GUN 
THESE FOUR MEN ARE GUN EXPERTS 
THEY KNOW HOW TO GET THEM THEY KNOW HOW TO USE THEM AND NOW THEY'RE DOING TIME FOR THE COMMISSION OF GUN RELATED CRIMES TONY ARMED ROBBERY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS CRAIG ARMED ROBBERY FIVE TO TEN YEARS ARMED ROBBERY AND KIDNAPPING NINE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS ARTHUR ARMED ROBBERY AND ATTEMPTED MURDER OF A POLICE OFFICER TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
ALL OF THEM ARE GRADUATES OF WHAT THEY CALL THE LIFE 
WHAT WAS YOUR EXPOSURE TO A GUN 
MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO A GUN IS I WAS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD 
I JUST GOT IT FROM AN OLDER GUY 
IT WAS JUST PASSED DOWN TO ME 
IT WASN'T ABOUT PAYING FOR IT OR YOU KNOW BORROWING IT OR ANYTHING 
IT WAS JUST PART OF MY TOOL 
I WAS DOING AND I NEEDED A GUN TO DO 
YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH THE GUN AND I DID 
MY FIRST ARMED ROBBERY I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A TEN SPEED 
THAT'S ALL I WANTED WAS A TEN SPEED A NEW TEN SPEED 
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST COMMITTED AN ARMED ROBBERY 
ABOUT THIRTEEN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN 
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN 
YEAH 
WHERE'D YOU GET THE GUN 
FOUND IT IN A CAR 
WE STOLE A CAR FOUND IT IN A STOLEN CAR 
I GOT A GUN THROUGH A FRIEND AN OLDER GENTLEMAN THAT HE USED TO BE A DRINKER AND DRUG USER AND HE KNEW ME AND ALL I DID WAS ASK FOR IT 
WAS THAT THE ONLY GUN YOU EVER HAD 
GOD NO 
THAT WAS THE FIRST GUN I'VE HAD YOU KNOW

DIFFERENT AREAS YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
DID YOU BUY THEM OFF THE STREET 
YOU BUY THEM OFF THE STREETS YOU FIND THEM IN HOUSES YOU FIND THEM IN CARS FIND THEM IN 
EVERYBODY HAS A GUN 
THEY'RE OUT THERE JUST LIKE CANDY AND CHIPS AND THE REST OF THAT YOU KNOW 
IT I MEAN YOU CAN GET THEM THAT EASY 
WELL IF I WANTED SOME CANDY OR CHIPS I'D GO TO THE GROCERY STORE 
IS THAT WHERE YOU GO TO GET A GUN 
DO YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE 
SOMETIMES 
SOMETIMES 
WELL YOU GET THEM MOST OFTEN FROM THE STREET

SOMETIMES TWENTY DOLLARS 
YOU CAN GET IT FOR A TWENTY DOLLAR BAG OF DOPE 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET IT FOR TWENTY DOLLARS 
OR YOU KNOW A ROCK OF COKE OR I MEAN IT'S NOTHING 
ONCE I PAID FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A GUN 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PUBLICITY ABOUT SO CALLED ASSAULT WEAPONS 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
YOU KNOW WHAT ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE 
DID YOU EVER HAVE ONE 
YEAH 
WHERE'D YOU GET IT 
DRUG DEAL 
WHY DID YOU WANT IT 
CAUSE EVERYONE ELSE HAD IT 
MY ZERO POINT THREE EIGHT WASN'T DOING GOOD ANYMORE 
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS YOU KNOW USING SO I COULDN'T USE A ZERO POINT THREE EIGHT ANYMORE 
THAT WASN'T THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
DID YOU HAVE A GUN OF CHOICE 
I HAD A FAVORITE A PEARL HANDLED ZERO POINT THREE EIGHT THAT I USED TO LIKE 
WHY DID YOU LIKE IT 
CAUSE IT FIT LIKE A GLOVE 
DID YOU HAVE A FAVORITE GUN 

ANY GUN THAT WORKED WAS MY FAVORITE 
THAT WAS IT 
LIKE A DIFFERENT TOOL FOR A DIFFERENT JOB 
OKAY IF THE GOING TO BE USED FOR A ROBBERY IF THE GOING TO BE USED FOR A HIT YOU KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENT GUN FOR A DIFFERENT JOB 
SO IT'S A THERE YOU SEE 
HAS ANY OF YOU EVER SHOT ANYONE 
I MEAN YOU'RE ALL HERE 
COME ON LET'S JUST TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT 
WELL LET'S SAY HYPOTHETICALLY IF SOMEBODY HAD SHOT SOMEBODY DOES THAT CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON 
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL DIFFERENT 
WHERE I COME FROM JUST TO SURVIVE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAD TO DIE 
SOME PEOPLE HAD TO DIE YOU KNOW 
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I SHOT ANYONE BUT I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF DRUGS OR BECAUSE OF DISPUTES OR WHATEVER 
I MEAN IT'S A CRAZY WORLD 
NO OFFENSE HERE BUT ALL OF YOU AT THE POINT YOU LEAVE HERE ALL OF YOU ARE CONVICTED FELONS WHO UNDER THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET A GUN 
DO YOU THINK IF YOU WANTED TO YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO GET ONE
