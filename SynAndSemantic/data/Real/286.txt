HE WAS DRESSED IN CAMOUFLAGE CLOTHING AND ARMED WITH A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN 
PRESIDENT CLINTON TRAVELED TODAY TO MARYLAND FOR SOME DUCK HUNTING 
AS C. N. N.'S JOHN HOLLIMAN REPORTS THE PRESIDENT USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN HIS VIEWS ON WHAT ELSE GUN CONTROL 
THE PRESIDENT HEADED FOR MARYLAND'S EASTERN SHORE BEFORE SUNRISE 
AFTER A QUICK STOP TO BUY A HUNTING LICENSE EAR PLUGS AND A DUCK CALL MR. CLINTON AND EIGHT OTHER MEN TOOK UP THEIR POSITION IN A DUCK BLIND 
CONGRESSMAN BILL LOANED THE PRESIDENT A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN 
AFTER SEVERAL HOURS IN THE SUB FREEZING COLD TWO SHOTS WERE FIRED AND THE HUNTING PARTY CAME BACK TO THE LODGE WITH ONE DUCK 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THERE 
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED HOW THIS TRIP WOULD AFFECT HIS GUN CONTROL IMAGE 
I WOULD EXPECT THAT IT MAKES A POINT I'VE BEEN MAKING 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HUNTING 
MY POSITIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HUNTING 
IT WAS LESS THAN A MONTH AGO THAT MR. CLINTON SIGNED THE BRADY HANDGUN CONTROL BILL INTO LAW AND MADE CLEAR HIS POSITION ON HUNTING 
I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY OUT IN THE COUNTRY PUTTING THE CAN ON TOP OF A FENCE POST AND SHOOTING A ZERO POINT TWO TWO AT IT 
I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I PULLED THE TRIGGER ON A ZERO POINT FOUR ONE ZERO SHOTGUN 'CAUSE I WAS TOO LITTLE TO HOLD THE TWELVE GAUGE 
I CAN REMEMBER THESE THINGS 
THE PRESIDENT'S HUNTING TRIP BROUGHT OUT A LONE PROTESTER FROM AN ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP 
THIS WAS MR. CLINTON'S FIRST HUNTING TRIP AS PRESIDENT AND NOW HE'S HUNTING FOR SOMETHING ELSE A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
