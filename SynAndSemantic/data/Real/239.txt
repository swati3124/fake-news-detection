WITH GOOD REASON SYLVESTER STALLONE AND WESLEY SNIPES THEIR MUSCLES FOR A BOX OFFICE RECORD THIS WEEKEND 
OUR MOVIE ANALYST MARTIN GROVE JOINS US NOW TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT 
HI MARTIN 
HI JIM 
YOU KNOW WITH GROSSES LIKE THESE YOU'D THINK IT WAS STILL SUMMER 
NOW DEMOLITION MAN DEMOLISHED THE RECORD FOR THE BEST FALL OPENING EVER WHILE ALSO SYLVESTER STALLONE'S CAREER COMEBACK PROVING THAT HIS FANS WILL LINE UP TO SEE HIM IN ACTION 
DEMOLITION MAN IS THE KIND OF ACTION PACKED PICTURE YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE RELEASED DURING EITHER THE SUMMER OR CHRISTMAS SEASONS WHEN MOVIEGOING PEAKS 
BUT BY OPENING IN THE FALL WARNER BROTHERS WAS ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON LESS COMPETITION AND LOWER EXPECTATIONS 
IN ADDITION SINCE THE FILM OPENED ON COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND WITH MONDAY BEING A DAY OFF FOR MANY PEOPLE IN BOTH THE U. S. AND CANADA DEMOLITION MAN BENEFITED FROM WELL ABOVE AVERAGE SUNDAY NIGHT BUSINESS 
AND THOUGH MOST CRITICS FOUND THE FILM TO BE LACKING IN THE STORY DEPARTMENT A WELL ORCHESTRATED MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOCUSING ON THE MOVIE'S ACTION WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DRAWING YOUNG MALES TO THEATERS 
INTERESTINGLY THIS IS THE SAME STRATEGY WARNER BROTHERS CLEVERLY USED LAST YEAR FOR THE PREVIOUS OCTOBER RECORD HOLDER UNDER SIEGE 
ELSEWHERE IT WAS SMOOTH SLEDDING IN WEEK TWO FOR DISNEY'S COMEDY COOL 
IN FACT THE WEEKEND WAS GREAT FOR THE MOVIE BUSINESS IN GENERAL 
UP NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OVER LAST YEAR BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
COOL IS ATTRACTING FAMILY AUDIENCES 
MALICE AND THE GOOD SON ARE A HIT WITH ADULTS AND THE AGE OF INNOCENCE AND THE JOY LUCK CLUB WHICH APPEAL TO ADULT FEMALES ARE ALSO KEEPING BOX OFFICE CASH REGISTERS RINGING 
THIS WEEKEND'S OTHER NOTABLE OPENING WAS GETTYSBURG FROM NEW LINE CINEMA AND TURNER PICTURES 
DESPITE BEING LIMITED TO ONLY ONE SHOWING PER NIGHT DUE TO ITS FOUR AND A HALF HOUR LENGTH THE PICTURE MANAGED TO RAKE IN NEARLY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON ONLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR SCREENS 
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE
