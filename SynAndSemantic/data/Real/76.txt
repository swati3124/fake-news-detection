NOW TO LAW AND ORDER 
SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE DOMINATED BY THE REPUBLICANS 
BUT THIS YEAR WITH THE ECONOMY SLUMPING AND CRIME TOUCHING THE LIVES OF MORE AND MORE AMERICANS THE LAW AND ORDER ISSUE IS UP FOR GRABS 
IN LOS ANGELES C. N. N.'S DAN BLACKBURN 
IN PARTS OF AMERICA VIOLENT CRIME HAS BECOME AN ASPECT OF DAILY LIFE AND VOTERS BOTH URBAN AND SUBURBAN WANT THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO PAY MORE ATTENTION 
STOP CUTTING TAXES AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THIS CRIME WE HAVE OUT HERE 
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S A HIGH PRIORITY BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY'VE ADDRESSED IT YET 
IN RECENT DAYS PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEGUN HAMMERING AWAY AT THE ISSUE 
LAST YEAR UNDER BILL CLINTON THE AVERAGE ARKANSAS CRIMINAL SERVED JUST ONE FIFTH OF HIS SENTENCE AND THEN IT'S BACK ON THE STREETS 
APPARENTLY IN ARKANSAS YOU DO CRIME BUT NOT THE TIME 
BILL CLINTON ALSO HAMMERS AT THE ISSUE 
FOUR YEARS AGO THIS CRIME ISSUE WAS USED TO DIVIDE AMERICANS 
I WANT TO USE IT TO UNITE AMERICANS 
I WANT TO BE TOUGH ON CRIME AND GOOD FOR CIVIL RIGHTS 
YOU CAN'T HAVE CIVIL JUSTICE WITHOUT ORDER AND SAFETY 
CLINTON WAS REFERRING IN PART TO THIS NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL THE SO CALLED WILLIE HORTON COMMERCIAL USED TO LINK DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS TO BEING SOFT ON CRIME 
IT'S AN ISSUE REPUBLICANS HAVE RUN ON SUCCESSFULLY SINCE THE SIXTIES WHEN URBAN RIOTING APPEARED TO PUT DEMOCRATS OFF BALANCE OVER LAW AND ORDER 
THE DEMOCRATS GAVE THE CRIME ISSUE TO THE REPUBLICANS 
THEY VERY WISELY TOOK IT AND RAN WITH IT AND THEY ASSOCIATED IT WITH RACE WHICH WAS A WIN WIN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THESE TWO DECADES 
THIS YEAR HOWEVER POLLSTERS SAY CRIME CAN'T COMPETE POLITICALLY WITH THE ECONOMY 
WHERE IT COMES INTO PLAY IS IF CLINTON STARTS TO TUMBLE IN A GENERAL WAY THEN PEOPLE RATIONALIZE WHY THEY'RE VOTING AGAINST HIM 
AND AT THAT POINT CRIME AND ALL THE LITTLE ISSUES THEY'RE BRINGING UP NOW COME INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS 
HOWEVER SINCE GEORGE BUSH TOOK OFFICE THE MURDER RATE HAS INCREASED BY THIRTEEN PERCENT 
ROBBERY IS UP SEVENTEEN PERCENT AND RAPE UP ELEVEN PERCENT 
AND POLICE OFFICERS TALK ESCALATING VIOLENCE 
THIS DEPUTY DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IS BROTHER RECENTLY TRIED TO MAKE A TRAFFIC STOP 
AND THE GANG MEMBERS DIDN'T STOP AND A PASSENGER HUNG OUT THE WINDOW WITH AN A. K. FORTY SEVEN AND SHOT UP HIS CAR 
HE'S VERY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE 
THE HEAD OF THE NATION'S LARGEST SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS THE ANSWER IS NOT TOUGH TALK BUT BETTER FEDERAL PERFORMANCE 
WE'LL DO OUR JOB LOCALLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY OUR DIFFICULTIES OUR PROBLEMS ARE EXACERBATED CONSIDERABLY NOT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT HELPING US DO OUR JOB THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOB 
BLOCK AND OTHERS INSIST WHAT IS NEEDED IS NOT TOUGHER LAWS BUT BETTER MORE EFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS 
AND THEY SAY THE CANDIDATES FROM PRESIDENT ON DOWN FAIL TO DEAL WITH THAT REALITY ALL TOGETHER
