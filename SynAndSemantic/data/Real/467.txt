ONE OF BRITAIN'S NATIONAL TREASURES MAY BE HIDING A TREASURE OF ITS OWN 
IT'S WINDSOR CASTLE JUST WEST OF LONDON A RESIDENCE OF THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY 
C. N. N.'S MARGARET LOWRIE REPORTS 
WINDSOR CASTLE FILLED WITH THE PRICELESS TREASURES AND TRADITIONS OF NINE CENTURIES OF BRITISH HAS LONG BEEN RUMORED TO GUARD WEALTH OF ANOTHER KIND OIL 
NOW QUEEN ELIZABETH HAS GIVEN A CANADIAN COUNTRY CONSENT TO BEGIN EXPLORATION NEXT YEAR TO TRY TO FIND IT 
DISMAYED TOWN PLANNERS WORRY ABOUT POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO IMAGE 
WE FEEL THAT THIS MAY BE THE THIN END OF AN ENVIRONMENTALLY BAD WEDGE 
AND IF IT IS WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT 
NESTLED ALONG THE THAMES RIVER THE WATERWAY LEADING TO LONDON SOME TWENTY MILES AWAY SAXON KINGS FAVORED WINDSOR FOR HUNTING 
THE BUILT THE FIRST FORTRESS AFTER WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR INVADED IN ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
SOME THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVE IN MODERN DAY WINDSOR ANOTHER FOUR MILLION VISIT EACH YEAR 
SOME VIEW OIL EXPLORATION AS A OF THEIR NATIONAL HERITAGE 
THE SANCTITY OF THE ROYALTY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULD REMAIN AS IT IS 
IF THEY WANT TO DRILL THERE'S PLENTY OF OIL ELSEWHERE 
I JUST THINK THEY SHOULD LEAVE IT ALONE 
BUT WINDSOR IS ALSO THE QUEEN'S WEEKEND HOME AND MANY HERE SAY IF SHE APPROVES IT IT MUST BE OKAY 
IT'S ON THE QUEEN'S LAND SO I THINK THE DECISION REMAINS WITH QUEEN 
SHE WOULDN'T DO IT IF IT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA 
SOME EXPERTS SAY THE FLAP OVER ROYAL OIL IS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
IF THERE IS OIL THERE THE PRODUCTION SITE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A TENNIS COURT 
AND PROBABLY IT WILL BE SCREENED BY TREES AND BUSHES SO THAT UNLESS YOU WERE INSIDE THERE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT WAS THERE 
SOME REPORTS ESTIMATE THERE MAY BE AS MUCH AS ONE HUNDRED MILLION BARRELS OF OIL UNDER THE GROUNDS OF THE GREAT PARK 
BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S CROWN PROPERTY ANY ROYALTIES WOULD GO TO THE NATION'S TREASURY NOT THE QUEEN 
THE CANADIAN COMPANY WANTS TO START EXPLORATION NEXT SEPTEMBER BUT TOWN OFFICIALS SAY DON'T GET OUT THE DRILL YET 
THE QUEEN'S CONSENT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH 
THE FINAL DECISION RESTS WITH THE COUNTRY COUNCIL AND THAT WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL JANUARY
