ACTOR JEFF GOLDBLUM PLAYED A SELF CENTERED JOURNALIST IN THE BIG CHILL A SCIENTIST WHO TURNED HIMSELF INTO AN INSECT IN THE FLY AND AN ALIEN IN EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY 
WELL THIS TIME OUT IN DEEP COVER GOLDBLUM PLAYS A LAWYER WHO IS DRAWN TO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW 
CYNTHIA HAS THE STORY 
IN DEEP COVER JEFF GOLDBLUM A CHARMING AMBITIOUS ATTORNEY WITH A DOUBLE LIFE 
I'M A LAWYER ARTICULATE SUCCESSFUL WITH A FAMILY MAN A WIFE AND A DAUGHTER 
BUT I'VE GOT THIS SECRET DARK SHADOW LIFE AS A BIG TIME DRUG DEALER 
SEDUCED BY THE POWER AND WEALTH PROVIDED BY HIS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE GOLDBLUM FORMS A PARTNERSHIP WITH A DEALER PLAYED BY LARRY 
LITTLE DOES HE KNOW HIS PARTNER WORKS UNDERCOVER FOR THE D. E. A. 
WHILE WORKING ON THE FILM GOLDBLUM MET A LAWYER WHO'D HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE 
HE'D STARTED OUT DEFENDING DRUG DEALERS AND THEN KIND OF GETTING INVOLVED WITH TAKING DRUGS HIMSELF AND THEN DEALING DRUGS 
IT MADE GOLDBLUM WONDER WHY PEOPLE BECOME INVOLVED AT ALL 
THE INTERESTING THING TO ME I SUPPOSE IS ADDRESSING THE REASONS FOR DRUG USE OR ALCOHOL USE AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE STRESSES AND ELEMENTS OF LIFE OTHERWISE BAD PARENTING EVEN 
BY THE WAY BAD PARENTING IS THE SUBJECT OF NEXT FILM FATHERS AND SONS 
HE A HARD DRINKING BELLIGERENT FILM DIRECTOR WHO DECIDES TO CHANGE HIS WAYS FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE 
I QUIT THE MOVIE BUSINESS I TRY TO SALVAGE SOMETHING WITH MY SON GIVE HIM SOMETHING THAT I OBVIOUSLY HADN'T GIVEN HIM BEFORE AND COULDN'T GIVE TO MY WIFE 
THAT'S NOT ALL HIS CHARACTER GIVES AWAY 
AT FIRST WHEN I HEARD WHAT THE PLOT WAS ABOUT I COULDN'T QUITE PICTURE YOU PLAYING THE FATHER OF A TEENAGE SON 
CAN YOU PICTURE YOURSELF 
OH THAT'S VERY FLATTERING THANKS 
YOU MEAN I'M TOO YOUNG 
WELL SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT AT AGE THIRTY NINE GOLDBLUM ISN'T THINKING ABOUT CHILDREN RIGHT NOW
