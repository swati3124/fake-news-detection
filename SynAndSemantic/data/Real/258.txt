YOU HEAR IT IN COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC AND IN THE BLUES AND IN POPULAR MUSIC FROM BOB DYLAN TO THE BEATLES TO STEVIE WONDER 
NOW THE HARMONICA IS MAKING A COMEBACK AND ANOTHER ENTERPRISING MUSICIAN IS MAKING A VERY HANDSOME LIVING AS A RESULT 
A. B. C.'S JUDY MULLER REPORTS FROM LOS ANGELES 
THE HARMONICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MAINSTAY OF AMERICAN MUSIC 
NOW THE HUMBLE HARMONICA IS ENJOYING A NEW WAVE OF POPULARITY 
AND RIDING THAT WAVE IS JON MASTER OF THE MOUTH HARP AND FACILITATOR OF 
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ON HORSEBACK BY YOURSELF OR YOU'RE THE LONELY OR IT'S A BLUES FANTASY 
I THINK THERE'S A ROMANCE THERE'S A FANTASY INVOLVED WITH THE HARP 
FOR IT'S BEEN A LUCRATIVE LOVE AFFAIR 
HIS BOOKS AND TAPE INCLUDING HARMONICA FOR THE MUSICALLY HOPELESS HAVE SOLD MORE THAN A MILLION COPIES AROUND THE WORLD 
HIS OVERHEAD IS IN PROPORTION TO HIS INSTRUMENT SMALL 
HE RECORDS HIS TAPES AT HIS OFFICE AND CARRIES THE TOOLS OF HIS TRADE IN HIS BRIEFCASE 
THIS IS THE BEST WAY THAT I'VE EVER HAD OF MAKING MY LIVING 
AND IT SEEMS LIKE AN ODDBALL WAY BUT THE OTHER THINGS I'VE TRIED HAVEN'T WORKED 
BUT WHEN I TEACH OR WHEN I PLAY IT'S LIKE THE WORLD SAYS YES GIVE US MORE 
HERE'S SOME MONEY 
HIS CLASSES ARE ALWAYS JAMMED 
BY DAY THEY ARE BANKERS AND 
BY NIGHT THEY ARE LEARNING THE ARCANE LANGUAGE OF THE MOUTH HARP 
YEAH YOU HAVE TO TONGUE AND BEND 
LEARNING HOW TO CUP THEIR HANDS JUST SO 
THAT'S THE START OF IT 
AND THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT 
LEARNING TO SOLO 
AND LEARNING MORE OR LESS TO PLAY AS A GROUP 
ONE REASON THE HARMONICA IS SO POPULAR INSTANT GRATIFICATION 
I CAN INSTANTLY PLAY THIS 
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
YOU PICK IT UP IMMEDIATELY AND START PLAYING 
IT'S ALSO PORTABLE 
I WAS PLAYING MY HARMONICA IN THE CAR AND I LOOKED UP AND I SAW A GUY RIDING ON A BICYCLE COMING THE OTHER WAY PLAYING HIS HARMONICA 
PORTABLE WITH ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES 
I'D LIKE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE MAYBE WHEN I'M SITTING IN SOME BLUES BAR AND IT'S JAM NIGHT AND THEY SAY DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE WANT TO COME UP AND JAM AND I JUST TAKE OUT MY HARP OUT OF MY POCKET AND HOP UP THERE AND DO IT 
IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE WALTER WELL A FEW PIPE DREAMS NEVER HURT ANYONE
