PRESIDENT CLINTON HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL LAST NIGHT SPEAKING LOUDLY AND CARRYING A BIG STICK 
C. N. N. CORRESPONDENT CLAIRE SHIPMAN IS LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE STORY 
GOOD MORNING CLAIRE 
GOOD MORNING BOB 
NOW DESPITE ALL THE TALK THAT SOME CANDIDATES VIEW PRESIDENT CLINTON AS A LIABILITY HE'S BEEN ON THE STUMP LATELY FOR A NUMBER OF FELLOW DEMOCRATS 
LAST NIGHT HE ATTENDED TWO FUNDRAISERS FOR INCUMBENT SENATOR CHARLES ROBB WHO'S IN A TIGHT AND HIGHLY PUBLICIZED RACE WITH OLIVER NORTH 
AND DESPITE HIS RECENT OF BIPARTISANSHIP HE LASHED OUT AT THE REPUBLICANS 
AND THEY RAISE MORE MONEY THAN WE DO TO TURN THEIR OPPONENTS INTO ALIENS RIGHT 
HOW DO THEY DO THAT 
THEY DO THAT BY FEAR OVER HOPE BY BLAME OVER RESPONSIBILITY BY DIVISION OVER UNITY 
THAT IS WHAT THEY DO 
AND THEY ARE BRILLIANT AT IT 
THEY SORT OF TRY TO TURN YOU INTO A SPACE ALIEN 
I TELL PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND THEY ARE DEVOTED TO IT 
AND THEY ARE BRILLIANT AT SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO APPEAL MOSTLY TO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES BADLY IN NEED OF CASH BECAUSE DESPITE HIS IMAGE PROBLEMS HE CAN STILL RAKE IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
NOW FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS A CHANCE TO TURN HIS ATTENTION AWAY FROM POLITICS AND TOWARD PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA'S VISIT 
AIDS SAY THERE HASN'T BEEN SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE IN YEARS AND IN FACT THE STATE DINNER TONIGHT IS SAID TO BE THE HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN SINCE THE INAUGURATION 
NOW FOR MR. MANDELA IT'S LARGELY A FUNDRAISING MISSION 
FOR THE PRESIDENT THEY'RE CALLING IT A SUCCESS STORY A CHANCE TO CELEBRATE A SUCCESS STORY THAT THEY IN FACT CAN TAKE SOME CREDIT FOR
