OUR GUEST TODAY AGREES THE EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE WHERE THE VALUE IS RIGHT NOW 
HE MANAGES A TEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FUND THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE 
HERE IS ROBIN INVESTMENT DIRECTOR OF SCOTTISH WIDOWS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 
GOOD DAY ROBIN 
GOOD MORNING 
NOW DESPITE THE NAME SCOTTISH WIDOWS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT THE BULK OF YOUR CLIENTS ARE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IS THAT CORRECT 
THAT'S CORRECT YES 
ALL RIGHT AND YOUR SCOPE IS GLOBAL 
YOU INVEST ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WE DO MAINLY IN GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS AND BOND MARKETS 
SO WHERE ARE YOU PUTTING BIG INVESTORS' MONEY NOW 
WELL WE HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING EUROPEAN EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS RECENTLY 
THE ARGUMENT MAINLY AS THE EUROPEAN INTEREST RATES WILL FALL AND BOOST STOCK AND BOND MARKETS 
WHAT ABOUT THE MARKET IN THE U. S. 
HOW ATTRACTIVE IS THAT IN RELATIVE TERMS 
WELL WE DON'T THINK ANY OF THE MARKETS ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME 
WE THINK THAT GAINS FROM HERE WILL BE RELATIVELY MODEST BUT THE U. S. WE FEEL IS LOOKING POTENTIALLY QUITE INTERESTING AND WE MAY WANT TO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE HERE 
WAIT A SECOND THE U. S. IS LOOKING POTENTIALLY QUITE INTERESTING BUT YOU HAVEN'T MOVED THE MONEY HERE YET IS THAT ACCURATE 
NOT YET 
WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE THE MARKET MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN IT IS 
ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A NASTY SELLOFF IN OCTOBER AND THEN YOU'LL MOVE IN WITH SOME MONEY 
YES 
WE DON'T EXPECT A LARGE SELLOFF BUT WE WOULD LOOK FOR A SMALL SELLOFF 
THE REASONING HERE IS THAT YOU'VE GOT MONEY IN EUROPE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE MARKETS WHICH ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM A RECESSIONARY ECONOMY THERE AND ARE POISED TO TAKE OFF MAYBE AT SOME POINT NEXT YEAR WHEREAS THE AMERICAN MARKETS ARE SORT OF MATURE AFTER A SOLID FOR A LONG TIME NOW 
THAT'S TRUE 
WHERE WILL YOU PUT YOUR MONEY WHEN YOU DO MOVE IT INTO AMERICA 
WE WILL GO INTO THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR 
WE THINK THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN AMERICA IS WELL PLACED FOR THE MEDIUM TERM 
RIGHT NOW I GUESS WE'RE A LOW COST PRODUCER PART BECAUSE OF THE DOLLAR AND SOME LABOR CONCESSIONS CORRECT 
ABSOLUTELY 
ALL RIGHT 
A QUESTION FOR YOU AS REGARDS THE EUROPEAN MARKETS 
YOU SAID THE BULK OF YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE IN EUROPEAN EQUITIES 
WHY EUROPEAN EQUITIES AS OPPOSED TO EUROPEAN BOND MARKETS IF YOU EXPECT EUROPEAN INTEREST RATES TO COME DOWN 
WELL WE'RE TRADITIONALLY AN EQUITY INVESTMENT HOUSE AND WE DO HAVE 
BUT DO YOU THINK THERE ARE BETTER GAINS TO BE MADE SOMETIMES IN THE BOND MARKET 
I MEAN 
SOMETIMES THERE ARE BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENTLY GOOD COMPANIES IN EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS TO BONDS 
I WANT TO JUST GET BACK TO AMERICA FOR A SECOND 
NAME SOME MANUFACTURERS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT MONEY INTO WHEN YOU DO FINALLY DECIDE TO PUT SOME CASH IN THE U. S. 
WELL WE LIKE THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS FORD AND GENERAL MOTORS 
THEY'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT ALREADY THOUGH 
WE THINK THERE'S MUCH FARTHER TO GO ACTUALLY 
WHICH ONE OF THE BIG THREE 
GENERAL MOTORS FORD OR CHRYSLER 
FORD 
FORD 
GIVE ME SOME MORE MANUFACTURERS THAT YOU LIKE 
WELL WE LIKE 
WE LIKE SOME OF THE 
YOU LIKE 
YES 
FORGIVE ME I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE COMPANY 
WHAT DOES IT DO 
WELL IT'S AN ELECTRONICS RELATED COMPANY 
O. K. FAIR ENOUGH 
AND WE ALSO LIKE STEEL COMPANIES
