AND WELCOME TO C. N. N. WORLD REPORT 
WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU THE NEWS AS REPORTED BY THE WORLD'S BROADCASTERS FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE 
I'M RALPH 
AS WE MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO THE FOURTH ANNUAL C. N. N. WORLD REPORT CONFERENCE IS UNDERWAY IN ATLANTA SOME TWO HUNDRED CONTRIBUTORS FROM MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED COUNTRIES ARE GATHERED TO CONFER ON THE EVOLVING ROLE OF THE MEDIA AROUND THE WORLD 
AS IN YEARS PAST ON WORLD REPORT WE'RE TURNING TO SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONFERENCE TO SHARE THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR REGIONS 
FIRST TODAY WE'LL BE JOINED BY NORA OF N. B. C. NAMIBIA FOR SOME INSIGHT ON AFRICA 
FIRST HOWEVER A QUICK LOOK AT SOME OF THIS YEAR'S DEVELOPMENTS ON THAT OFTEN TROUBLED CONTINENT 
IN SOMALIA TODAY U. S. TROOPS TURNED OVER CONTROL OF FAMINE RELIEF TO UNITED NATIONS' FORCES 
THE U. S. LED OPERATION MAY HAVE SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES BUT SOMALIA'S TROUBLES ARE FAR FROM OVER 
THE FAMINE IN NEIGHBORING SUDAN HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS PERHAPS THAT OF SOMALIA'S 
AND EFFORTS TO FEED THE STARVING ARE LARGELY BEING BLOCKED BY THE MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST GOVERNMENT AND BY OTHER PARTIES TO THE COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONTINENT THE TOUGHEST TROUBLE SPOT REMAINS LIBERIA WHERE A VICIOUS CIVIL WAR CONTINUES DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF A WESTERN AFRICAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE 
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THERE'S SOME REASON FOR HOPE IN NIGERIA WHERE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS ARE PLANNED FOR NEXT MONTH AND MILITARY RULE SEEMS LIKELY TO END 
LAST DECEMBER KENYA REACHED A MILESTONE OF SORTS BY HOLDING ITS FIRST MULTI PARTY ELECTIONS THE RESULTS OF WHICH WERE WIDELY DISPUTED 
IN THE MEANTIME IN SOUTHERN AFRICA TWO LONG TERM SORES CONTINUE TO FESTER THE EIGHTEEN YEAR CIVIL WAR IN ANGOLA GOES ON DESPITE LAST YEAR'S SIGNING OF A PEACE TREATY 
AND IN SOUTH AFRICA EFFORTS TO END APARTHEID ARE HAMPERED BY BLACK FACTIONAL VIOLENCE AND BY CONTINUED RESISTANCE TO MAJORITY RULE FROM SOME POWERFUL WHITE GROUPS 
JOINING US FOR SOME MORE INSIGHT INTO AFRICA NORA OF N. B. C. NAMIBIA 
THE PROBLEM OF SUDAN IT IS ALMOST LIKE A MIRROR OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN FOR SO LONG IN SOMALIA 
IS IT IS THE SAME THING HAPPENING THERE 
IT'S BEEN A LONGER CONFLICT FOR A FIRST START 
AND I THINK THE PROBLEMS ARE DIFFERENT IN THE SUDANESE CONFLICT 
I THINK THE SUDANESE CONFLICT IS BASICALLY ONE OF THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY BEING DEVELOPING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY 
THAT OF COURSE FOR VARIOUS REASONS HAS BEEN AND IS NOW MADE OUT TO BE A RACIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN BLACKS AND THE ARABS WHEN IN FACT IT ISN'T IT'S BASICALLY A PROBLEM OF 
BUT WE THERE WERE WIRE REPORTS THIS AFTERNOON SHOWING THAT THOUSANDS OF LIVES ARE AT STAKE OVER THERE RIGHT NOW 
AND THE FOOD APPARENTLY IS BEING SENT BUT JUST NOT GETTING TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT 
YES 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS THE CASE IN SUDAN 
WHO THE COMPANIES WHO DO WE BLAME WHO IS TO BLAME IN THE SUDANESE CONFLICT WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THE FACT THAT FOOD DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED IT 
BOTH SIDES ARE TO BLAME 
IT'S NEITHER THE FAULT OF THE SUDANESE REBELS AND NEITHER IS THE GOVERNMENT TO BLAME BOTH SIDES I THINK ARE TO BLAME 
AND TO A LARGE EXTENT THE WORLD AS WELL FOR NOT HAVING TAKEN A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS SUDAN 
THE WORLD HAS MOST PART JUST SET BACK AND NOT TAKEN ACTIVE STEPS IN SOLVING THE SUDANESE CONFLICT 
LIBERIA 
WE THOUGHT FOR A WHILE THAT MAYBE THINGS WERE GOING TO WORK OUT FOR THE BETTER THERE AND THERE ARE STILL TROUBLES IN THAT COUNTRY 
THERE AGAIN I THINK THE WORLD HAS LEFT THE AFRICANS TO SOLVE THE LIBERIAN CONFLICT 
BY AND LARGE THE AFRICANS HAVE BEEN LEFT TO SOLVE IT AS WE SEE WITH THE INTERVENTION 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT CAPABLE OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM WITHOUT SOME OUTSIDE HELP 
WELL HAVE THEY SOLVED IT 
NO THEY HAVEN'T 
WHICH MEANS THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER SOLUTION HAS TO BE FOUND 
AND MAYBE AN OUTSIDE INTERVENTION THE UNITED NATIONS INTERVENTION AMERICAN INTERVENTION TO KEEP THE PEACE 
WHAT ABOUT ANGOLA 
YES 
ONE OF MY PET TOPICS 
IN ANGOLA I WOULD BLAME THE UNITED STATES 
THEY ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE IN MY OPINION FOR THAT CONFLICT 
FOR A VERY LONG TIME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THEY HELPED AND THEY SUPPORTED SAVIMBI 
WHEN HE RE WHEN HE RESTARTED THE WAR AFTER HE LOST THE ELECTIONS I THINK THE ONUS WAS ON THE UNITED STATES TO PUT PRESSURE ON SAVIMBI AND TO BRING HIM IN LINE 
AND THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO 
AND WHAT HAPPENED 
HE GOT SO MUCH POWER THAT NOW IT IS TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
NUMBER 
IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
I THINK THAT THE UNITED STATES IF THE UNITED STATES REALLY HAD FIRM COMMITMENT TOWARD PEACE IN ANGOLA THEY WOULD HAVE MOVED IN AND THEY WOULD HAVE NEUTRALIZED SAVIMBI 
AND THEY HAVEN'T DONE SO 
SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER AS WE LOOK AT IT TODAY 
YOU'VE SAID THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST WAS THE PROBLEM 
WELL WHAT DO WE DO NOW 
WELL I THINK FOR A START GIVING THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT THE LEGITIMATE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT WHICH CAME TO POWER AS WE ALL KNOW THROUGH THE BALLOT BOX I THINK RECOGNIZING THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT AND GIVING IT THE KIND OF ASSISTANCE THAT IT NEEDS AND IS ASKING FOR WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
ALL RIGHT
