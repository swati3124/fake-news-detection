IN THE NEW COMEDY THE JUDY DAVIS AND KEVIN PLAY A COUPLE WHOSE MARRIAGE IS ON THE ROCKS 
WHEN THEIR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR PROVES INEFFECTIVE THE END UP GETTING ADVICE FROM AN UNLIKELY SOURCE GUS THE CAT BURGLAR PLAYED BY COMEDIAN TURNED ACTOR DENIS LEARY 
BILL TUSH HAS MORE 
AFTER LEAVING THE SCENE OF A BOTCHED BURGLARY DENIS LEARY'S CHARACTER GUS TAKES A COUPLE HOSTAGE WHILE HE WAITS FOR THE HEAT TO DIE DOWN 
WHAT HE DOESN'T REALIZE IS THAT HE'S UNWITTINGLY BECOME DRAFTED INTO THE ROLE OF THE 
JUST TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE 
AND HE BASICALLY ENDS UP BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY THIS FAMILY PSYCHOLOGICALLY TORMENTED AND WILLING BASICALLY TO TURN HIMSELF IN AT ONE POINT BECAUSE THEY JUST WILL NOT SHUT UP 
AND WHILE GUS IS NOWHERE NEAR AS VILLAINOUS AS THE KILLER LEARY PORTRAYED IN JUDGMENT NIGHT THE ACTOR SAYS IT'S STILL A KICK PLAYING EVIL 
BAD GUYS CAN BE GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE SOMETIMES MORE INTERESTING THAN THE GOOD GUYS 
BUT THEN AGAIN THAT DEPENDS ON THE PART I GUESS IN THE FILM 
CASTING LEARY IN THE WAS LONG TIME FRIEND SLASH DIRECTOR TED DEMME 
DEMME LAST WORKED WITH LEARY ON THE FEATURE FILM WHO'S THE MAN 
PREVIOUS TO THAT DEMME CREATED THE M. T. V. SPOTS BASED ON MATERIAL FROM LEARY'S ONE MAN ACT 
THAT CATAPULTED THE QUICK WITTED COMEDIAN INTO THE SPOTLIGHT 
IT FEELS GREAT YOU KNOW 
I'M RICH 
NUMBER 
YOU ARE 
OH YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
HOW ABOUT THAT TWENTY 
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER 
YEAH IT FEELS GOOD BUT ALSO YOU KNOW IT'S HARD WORK 
AS FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THE 
IT'S A NIGHTMARE 
IT WAS WE REALLY HAD TO CARRY HIM ON OUR SHOULDERS LIKE A DEAD WEIGHT YOU KNOW FROM BEGINNING TO END 
BASICALLY I CAN BEAT HIM UP SO THAT'S REALLY THE REASON WE WORK WELL TOGETHER IS HE'S A TALL SKINNY GUY 
I'M A LITTLE THICKER 
AND HE'S BIGGER THAN ME 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT REALLY GET DOWN TO 
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS 
I CAN BEAT HIM UP 
ONE THING THAT LEARY AND DEMME DO AGREE ON IS THE TAKE ON THE UPS AND DOWNS OF BEING MARRIED 
DON'T DO IT 
DON'T DO IT 
DO IT BUT WATCH OUT 
DO IT BUT WEAR A HELMET 
DO IT BUT WEAR A HELMET 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED WITH A HELMET 
DO IT AND MAKE SURE THE COPS ARE NEARBY AT ALL TIMES
