A COUPLE OF STUDENTS HAVE MADE A FASCINATING DISCOVERY 
THE TWO HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS FROM OIL CITY PENNSYLVANIA HAD ASKED THE OBSERVATORY TO TAKE THIS TELESCOPE PICTURE OF A STAR CLUSTER 
AND A CLOSER LOOK REVEALED THAT THE WHITE BLOB THERE ON THE RIGHT WAS ACTUALLY A SUPER NOVA AN EXPLODING STAR 
MORE EARTHLY MATTERS 
IN WASHINGTON TODAY CONGRESSMAN DAN ROSTENKOWSKI STOOD HIS GROUND 
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE IS BATTLING THE PRESIDENT OVER HOW MUCH HEALTH CARE REFORM IS GOING TO COST AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S JOHN COCHRAN 
ROSTENKOWSKI SAID HIS STAFF HAS FOUND THAT HEALTH CARE REFORM IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN FIRST BELIEVED THAT IT WILL COST FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND 
THE QUESTION IS CAN I GET MEMBERS TO SWALLOW HARD AND VOTE FOR A BILL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
BUT NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO SWALLOW AS HARD AS ROSTENKOWSKI WAS 
HE REJECTED ROSTENKOWSKI'S CALL FOR A BROADBASED TAX TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE 
SHOULD I RAISE YOUR TAXES TO ASK YOU TO PAY WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING MORE FOR HEALTH CARE THAN YOU SHOULD 
THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HIS HEALTH PLAN IS ALREADY IN ENOUGH TROUBLE WITHOUT PROPOSING NEW TAXES 
AND IN A FURTHER CONCESSION TO POLITICAL REALITY THE PRESIDENT AGREED WHEN TED KENNEDY OFFERED A NEW PLAN TO EASE THE BURDEN THE CLINTON PLAN WOULD HAVE PUT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS SAY THE PRESIDENT'S ONLY CHANCE IS TO MAKE MORE CONCESSIONS 
SO WE'RE GOING TO GET A HEALTH PACKAGE THIS YEAR 
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ONE THAT IS A COMPROMISE AND TAKES THE BEST FEATURES OF ALL OF THE BILLS 
THE PRESIDENT'S ALLIES ON HEALTH CARE SAY BOTH HE AND MRS. CLINTON ARE STILL FULL OF FIGHT BUT HAVE ALSO STARTED LOWERING THEIR EXPECTATIONS CONSIDERABLY 
JOHN COCHRAN A. B. C. NEWS CAPITOL HILL
