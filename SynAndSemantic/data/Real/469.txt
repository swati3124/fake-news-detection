FIFTY THREE YEARS AGO JAPANESE PLANES LAUNCHED A SNEAK ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR FORCING THE UNITED STATES TO ENTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
IT WOULD BE FOUR LONG YEARS UNTIL THE WAR ENDED 
EVEN TODAY MEMORIES OF HOW THE WAR ENDED ARE STILL TOO PAINFUL FOR MANY JAPANESE 
C. N. N.'S ANDREA KOPPEL REPORTS ON A U. S. STAMP DESIGN THAT'S UP THOSE MEMORIES 
NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD 
SHE'S NOT RICH OR SUCCESSFUL OR FOR THAT MATTER UNIQUE 
SHE IS ONE OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND JAPANESE WHO'VE SPENT THE LAST FORTY NINE YEARS LIVING IN PAIN 
AS SOON AS I HEARD A BANG I FELT AS IF SOMEBODY HAD SCRATCHED OFF ALL OF MY SKIN WITH A BUNDLE OF NEEDLES 
IT WAS REALLY INDESCRIBABLE 
THE PAIN AND SHOCK WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
IT WAS A HOT SUMMER DAY AUGUST SIXTH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WHEN THE UNITED STATES DROPPED THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB ON HIROSHIMA HOME TO AND MANY OTHERS 
ON AUGUST NINTH THE U. S. DROPPED A SECOND A BOMB ON NAGASAKI 
SIX DAYS LATER JAPAN SURRENDERED 
LAST WEEK THE U. S. POSTAL SERVICE ANNOUNCED IT WILL ISSUE ANOTHER STAMP IN SEPTEMBER AS PART OF ITS SERIES COMMEMORATING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
ON IT THERE WILL BE A MUSHROOM CLOUD AND A CAPTION ATOMIC BOMBS HASTEN WAR'S END AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
EVEN IF IT WASN'T WRITTEN WE WOULD FEEL AN EXTRAORDINARY ANGER AT THE IDEA OF USING THE MUSHROOM CLOUD TO JUSTIFY THE A BOMBS 
WE BELIEVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS MUST NOT BE USED IN ANY KIND OF SITUATION 
THE STAMP INSULTS ALL THE VICTIMS OF THE A BOMB 
WE COULD NEVER FORGIVE IT 
ALMOST HALF A CENTURY LATER THE U. S. IS DISCOVERING JUST HOW FRESH THE MEMORIES ARE IN THIS COUNTRY OF WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO 
SINCE LAST WEEK'S ANNOUNCEMENT SURVIVORS AND THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HAVE REACTED UNIFORMLY STRONGLY CRITICIZING THE CHOICE OF THE MUSHROOM CLOUD STAMP 
PLEASE DON'T ISSUE THE STAMP 
WHY DON'T THEY ADMIT THAT DROPPING THE A BOMB WAS WRONG 
IT CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED BUT I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET AMERICA TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE JAPANESE PEOPLE 
ON WEDNESDAY THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF BOMB SURVIVORS IN JAPAN DECIDED IT WILL SEND A LETTER OF PROTEST TO U. S. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON 
THE GROUP HOPES THAT IF THE PRESIDENT WERE TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THOSE WHO SUFFERED THOSE WHO STILL SUFFER HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO HELP
