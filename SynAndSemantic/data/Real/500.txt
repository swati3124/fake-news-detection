PRESIDENT CLINTON IS MAKING A FINAL PITCH TO SETTLE THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL STRIKE 
HE SENT LEGISLATION TO CAPITOL HILL REQUIRING BINDING ARBITRATION 
HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH SAID HE THINKS IT'S A VERY BAD IDEA TO HAVE CONGRESS START SETTLING LABOR DISPUTES 
BUT THERE IS SOME SENTIMENT FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION 
IF THIS CONTINUES THERE MAY BE A CONGRESSIONAL SOLUTION BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE A FEW OWNERS WHO WANT TO BREAK THE PLAYERS' UNION AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE VOTING SITUATION 
SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT CLINTON HAVE ASKED BASEBALL FANS TO FLOOD CAPITOL HILL WITH PHONE CALLS 
SO FAR MOST CALLS TO REPRESENTATIVES ARE SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED IN BASEBALL 
C. N. N.'S JEFF FLOCK HAS FOUND A SIMILAR REACTION FROM BASEBALL FANS IN THE MIDWEST 
SO THIS AUGUST BODY IS GOING TO SOLVE THE BASEBALL STRIKE 
CONGRESS CAN'T DO IT 
THEY HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE RIPPING THE PEOPLE OFF 
SO THE NATIONAL LEADER IS GOING TO SAVE THE NATIONAL PASTIME 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO WITH IT 
IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS 
LESS THAN AN ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE FROM 
I FEEL LIKE THE PRESIDENT HAVE ENOUGH ON HIS HANDS AT THE PRESENT TIME TO NOT EVEN WORRY ABOUT THE BASEBALL STRIKE 
HEARD ON THE STREET IN ATLANTA 
HEARD ON THE AIR IN DETROIT 
ANYTIME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BIG BROTHER TO BAIL YOU OUT OF ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM 
ON LARRY AND BUTCH CALL IN SHOW THE SENTIMENT IS LEAVE BAD ENOUGH ALONE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S A NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE BASEBALL STRIKE 
THEN AGAIN TELL THAT TO THE GUY AT THE NEAR EMPTY NEAR WRIGLEY FIELD IN CHICAGO WHERE BUSINESS IS OFF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SINCE THE STRIKE 
BRING ON CONGRESS HE SAYS 
I THINK THAT THEY MIGHT JUST GIVE SOME KIND OF ADVICE AND KIND OF ADVISE BOTH SIDES OF THE BASEBALL INDUSTRY AND BASICALLY YOU KNOW HELP THEM MAKE A DECISION 
MOST ARE FOR THAT 
I THINK BILL CLINTON WANTS TO PLAY CATCHER FOR THE METS IS WHAT I THINK AND I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S DOING IT 
IN LOS ANGELES THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MIND 
BUT AT LEAST ONE MAN HAD THE RIGHT IDEA 
I THINK EVERYBODY'S AT FAULT 
THEY SHOULD SETTLE IT GET IT TOGETHER PLAY BASEBALL 
PLAY BALL 
OH TO HEAR THAT SOUND
