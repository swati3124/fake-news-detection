AFTER TEN MONTHS OF WHAT PILOTS CALL BORING HOLES IN THE SKY U. S. AIR FORCE F. PATROLLING BOSNIA'S NO FLY ZONE GOT ORDERS TO SHOOT 
THROUGH THE FLASH 
THE WHITE FLASH ON THE PILOT'S HEADS UP DISPLAY IS AN RADAR GUIDED MISSILE THAT TOOK DOWN THE FIRST OF FOUR BOSNIAN SERB SUPER FIGHTER PLANES 
THE CONFRONTATION IS DESCRIBED BY THE F. SIXTEEN PILOT'S WING MAN CALL SIGN ZULU 
HE VISUALLY SIX 
HE OBSERVED THEM ROLLING IN ON THE TARGET DROPPING THEIR BOMBS 
HE SAW THE BOMBS HIT THE TARGET 
HE SAW SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS 
AFTER HE ROLLED OFF AND GOT CLEARANCE TO ENGAGE HE ENGAGED THE FIRST SHOOTING AT A MEDIUM ALTITUDE WITH AN AND THEN PRESSED IN TO SHOOT TWO OTHER WITH A NINE AT EXTREMELY LOW ALTITUDE 
SO ALL THREE IMMEDIATELY WERE DESTROYED AND BECAME A 
IN THE END FOUR OF THE YUGOSLAVIA MADE FELL PREY TO U. S. F. SIXTEEN FIGHTING 
AS FAR AS BEING FISH IN A BARREL I GUESS IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE LIKE YOU COULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE DROPPING BOMBS ON I SUPPOSE 
IT WASN'T MUCH OF A CONTEST WAS THERE 
WELL THAT'S WHAT YOUR TAX MONEY GOES FOR 
NATO COMMANDER ADMIRAL MIKE BOORDA SAID IF THE ATTACK WAS A TEST OF NATO RESOLVE IN HIS WORDS I THINK WE PASSED THE QUIZ 
VIOLATIONS OF THE NO FLY ZONE LIKE WE SAW TODAY WILL SIMPLY NOT BE TOLERATED AND IF WE CAN ENGAGE WE WILL ENGAGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID 
THE AIR DRAMA OVER THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA PUSHED THE WASHINGTON SLASH MOSCOW SPY TIT FOR TAT BELOW THE HORIZON AS THE FORMER COLD WAR CAPITALS RESUMED A SERIES OF POSITIVE EXCHANGES 
MY INFORMATION IS WE'VE HAD GOOD COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT THE FACTS WERE AND WHAT HAPPENED 
THE KREMLIN DIDN'T BLINK IN SUPPORTING THE U. S. DOWNING OF FOUR PLANES IN THE NO FLY ZONE ABOVE BOSNIA AND U. S. AMBASSADOR THOMAS AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IN MOSCOW TO PROTEST THE EXPULSION OF A U. S. DIPLOMAT TURNED RIGHT AROUND TO FULLY BRIEF HIS RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS ON THE BOSNIAN AIR ATTACK BY TWO U. S. JETS 
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT MEANWHILE OFFICIALS SAID THE INCIDENT WAS HAVING NO REPERCUSSIONS ON U. S. SPONSORED TALKS AIMED AT FORMING A LOOSE CONFEDERATION BETWEEN BOSNIAN MUSLIMS AND CROATS 
FEW OF THE WARRING PARTIES IN BOSNIA ARE SIGNING ON TO A FIRST STEP TOWARD PEACE A FEDERATION OF THE CROATS AND MUSLIMS IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLICS 
THE UNITED STATES BROKERED THE DEAL 
SECRETARY OF STATE CHRISTOPHER WAS PLEASED 
THIS AGREEMENT SHOWS HOW MUCH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED EVEN AFTER BITTER YEARS OF VIOLENCE WHEN THE TWO SIDES SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND WORK AS HARD AS THESE TWO SIDES HAVE TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING 
THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT WERE AS WELL 
WE HOPE AND PRAY THIS IS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS PEACE 
WE MADE A BIG STEP TODAY 
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE GREAT MORAL LEADERSHIP OF THE UNITED STATES 
TODAY I'M CONVINCED THAT WE TOOK THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PEACE IN BOSNIA HERCEGOVINA AND ALSO FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN BOSNIA HERCEGOVINA 
A SENIOR CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL CAUTIONED HOWEVER THAT THE DEAL SIGNED IN WASHINGTON WOULD NOT STOP THE FIGHTING AS HE PUT IT FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT AND THE OFFICIAL SAID A BROADER PEACE IN BOSNIA STILL DEPENDS ON GETTING THE POWERFUL SERBS TO JOIN THE NEGOTIATIONS AND GIVE UP TERRITORY 
THE BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RADOVAN KARADZIC CAME TO MOSCOW LOOKING FOR SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT ONLY TO DISCOVER THE RUSSIANS ARE SUPPORTING AN AMERICAN EFFORT TO BRING HIS MORTAL ENEMIES THE BOSNIAN MUSLIMS AND CROATS TOGETHER IN A POLITICAL CONFEDERATION AND ALL KARADZIC COULD DO WAS 
I DON'T THINK THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA COULD BE POSSIBLY AT THE SAME TIME BIASED IN THE FAVOR OF MUSLIMS AND IMPARTIAL 
WE NEED IMPARTIAL PEOPLE 
EVEN MORE GALLING TO KARADZIC WAS THE FACT THE RUSSIANS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE UNITED STATES FORCED THE BOSNIAN SERBS TO OPEN THE AIRPORT AT TUZLA TO HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FLIGHTS 
HOLDING THE SERBS' FEET TO THE FIRE WAS DEPUTY RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
IT WAS AN UNUSUALLY HEATED DEBATE THAT WE WERE SAYING THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR HUMANITARIAN AND POLITICAL REASONS AND THAT OUR PRESENCE THE PRESENCE OF OUR MONITORS WOULD GUARANTY NO MILITARY USE OF THE AIRPORT AND FINALLY OUR ARGUMENTS CARRIED THE DAY 
ARE WE NOW SEEING A COORDINATED CAMPAIGN AMONG THE GREAT POWERS TO BRING PEACE TO THE BALKANS 
I SURE HOPE SO 
IT IS CERTAINLY OUR EFFORT TO COORDINATE OUR STEPS WITH THE AMERICANS AND WITH OTHERS AND WE HOPE THAT FINALLY WE'LL COME TO A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE GOING AND THIS UNDERSTANDING WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO BE COORDINATED AND AGREED UPON WITH THE THREE BOSNIAN PARTIES 
MOST RUSSIAN'S SYMPATHIES IN THE BOSNIAN CRISIS REST WITH THEIR FELLOW THE SERBS BUT FEW HERE ARE EAGER TO HAVE A SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION OVER THE BALKANS LET ALONE SHED RUSSIAN BLOOD THERE 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF RUSSIAN TROOPS STAYING THERE 
YOU KNOW I AM STILL AFRAID OF STUFF LIKE THAT 
NINE YEARS OF WAR IN AFGHANISTAN IT WAS SUCH A SHAME FOR THIS COUNTRY 
SO FACED WITH PUBLIC RELUCTANCE TO PLUNGE RUSSIA INTO A BALKAN WAR AND UNWELCOME ARM TWISTING FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT THE BOSNIAN SERB LEADER WENT TO A SOCCER MATCH 
RADOVAN KARADZIC SEEKING OUT HIS POLITICAL SOUL MATE HERE VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY THE RUSSIAN ULTRA NATIONALIST LEADER 
WE'LL FIGHT TILL WE BRING PRICES DOWN UNTIL PEOPLE START LIVING BETTER 
UNTIL THEN WE'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT 
THERE WILL BE NO MORE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN THIS COUNTRY
