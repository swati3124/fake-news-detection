HOCKEY IS OF COURSE KING IN CANADA BUT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS CANADIANS WILL SHIFT THEIR ATTENTION TO AN AMERICAN INSTITUTION 
C. N. N.'S ED GARSTEN WAS IN TORONTO TO SEE HOW FANS THERE ARE GETTING SET FOR THIS TRULY WORLDLY SERIES 
THE BLUE MAY HAVE FLOWN THE COOP FOR A WEEKEND IN DIXIE BUT AS SURE AS THAT FLOCK FROM THEY'LL BE BACK IN TORONTO IN A FEW DAYS BRINGING WITH THEM THE FALL CLASSIC FOR IT'S FIRST TRIP ACROSS THE BORDER 
NOTE THE CALL OF THE CANADIAN BLUE JAY BAR FLY 
YES UP HERE IN THE GREAT WHITE NORTH THERE'S STILL SOME CONFUSION ABOUT JUST WHAT THIS WORLD SERIES BUSINESS IS ALL ABOUT 
THE WORLD SERIES WAS UH I THINK SPONSORED BY THE NEW YORK WORLD IN NINETEEN OH THREE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
UH HUH 
AND IN THIS TOWN CRAZY ABOUT THE CROWN THE VANS ARE ABOUT CHARGES FROM ACROSS THE BORDER THAT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT BASEBALL AS WELL AS THE YANKS 
WELL IT REALLY BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT 
AMERICANS ARE MORE NAIVE ABOUT CANADA THAN CANADIANS ARE ABOUT AMERICA I BELIEVE 
WE KNOW MORE ABOUT BASEBALL THAN YOU GIVE US CREDIT FOR 
IT'S NEW 
IT'S A NEW EXPERIENCE 
IT HASN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG A WINNING TEAM 
AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT 
WELL FACT IS TORONTO HAS HAD A BALL TEAM IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER SINCE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE 
AND LONGTIME SPORTS WRITER NEIL SAYS THE FIRST REALLY INTERNATIONAL WORLD SERIES WAS IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THE CUBAN SUGAR KINGS AGAINST MINNEAPOLIS 
AND IT WAS TERRIFIC 
I MEAN EVERY NIGHT FIDEL CASTRO WOULD MAKE THE GRAND ENTRANCE FIVE MINUTES BEFORE AT NINE O'CLOCK O'CLOCK AND THE FANS WOULD BE UP VIVA FIDEL 
WHETHER IT'S VIVA OR THE STAFF AT THE BLUE NEST WILL BE READY TO CATCH ANY LINGUISTIC CURVE BALLS 
A LOT OF OUR STAFF ARE BILINGUAL SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
AND IT SAYS IT ON THEIR WHAT THEY SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY SPEAK 
WELL EVEN IF YOU DO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH YOU MIGHT NEED A SLIGHT TRANSLATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE MENU 
FOR INSTANCE THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING CALLED CANDY 
NO IT'S NOT A DENTAL DEVICE FOR SUGAR FREAKS 
IT'S GOOD OL' COTTON CANDY 
OR A COURSE IN HOT HOT MEXICAN COLD COLD ITALIAN AND RONALD MCDONALD WITH ' AND FANS CAN VIRTUALLY EAT THEIR OWN WORLD SERIES AND WIN IN ONE GAME 
YES ALL THIS GIVES WAY TO SOME DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT 
WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS A CANADIAN CITY REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN LEAGUE 
AND AS DETROIT MANAGER SPARKY ANDERSON PUTS IT WELL REALLY ABOUT THE SAME AS NEW YORK OR CLEVELAND JUST SMELLS BETTER
