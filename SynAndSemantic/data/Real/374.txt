PRESIDENT CLINTON ON WHAT HE MEANS BY UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE 
IN RWANDA NO ONE IS ABLE TO STOP THE PANIC 
A HORRIFIED RELIEF WORKER SAYS WE CANNOT COPE 
AND THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY TELLS BLACK COMMUNITY LEADERS O. J. SIMPSON WILL RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL 
FROM A. B. C. THIS IS WORLD NEWS TONIGHT WITH PETER JENNINGS 
GOOD EVENING 
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A VERY INTENSE DEBATE ABOUT HEALTH CARE REFORM 
PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE A MAJOR SPEECH ABOUT HEALTH CARE TODAY 
AND WHEN IT WAS OVER ALL WASHINGTON WAS SAYING WHAT DID HE MEAN 
THE PRESIDENT SAID TODAY THAT GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHICH HAS BEEN THE CORNERSTONE OF HIS WHOLE PROPOSAL FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN EVERY AMERICAN 
SO FIRST TO BOSTON WHERE THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE SENATE ROBERT DOLE ADDRESSED THE NATION'S GOVERNORS 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S JIM WOOTEN 
FOR MONTHS THE PRESIDENT HAS AVOIDED PUTTING ANY NUMBERS ON HIS PROMISE OF COVERAGE FOR EVERYBODY 
TODAY HE FINALLY DID 
YOU CANNOT PHYSICALLY COVER ONE HUNDRED PERCENT 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
NOBODY CAN DO THAT 
FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY THE PRESIDENT 
IF YOU SEND ME LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE EVERY AMERICAN PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT CAN NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY YOU WILL FORCE ME TO TAKE THIS PEN VETO THE LEGISLATION AND WE'LL COME RIGHT BACK HERE AND START ALL OVER AGAIN 
BUT TODAY RECOGNIZING HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SOMETHING LESS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE OF SOMETHING HE CALLED FUNCTIONAL FULL COVERAGE 
THAT IS SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW NINETY SIX NINETY SEVEN NINETY EIGHT PERCENT 
SOCIAL SECURITY HAS NINETY EIGHT PERCENT 
YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT A FEW PEOPLE JUST WALKING AROUND OUT THERE 
SO THERE'S IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT COVERAGE OF ANYTHING 
HIS AIDES SAID IT'S ALL MERELY A MATTER OF 
PERHAPS 
BUT NINETY SIX PERCENT COVERAGE WOULD STILL LEAVE ABOUT EIGHT MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE 
SENATOR DOLE THE REPUBLICAN LEADER SPOKE TO THE GOVERNORS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT AND CONTINUED HIS ATTACK ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN AS TOO BIG TOO EXPENSIVE 
BUT KEEP IN MIND WE'RE ABOUT TO CREATE THE LARGEST SINGLE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM EVER CREATED IN HISTORY 
THAT ASSESSMENT HOWEVER IS AS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION AS MOST OF THE REST OF THE RHETORIC ON HEALTH CARE REFORM 
ALL I ASK IN THESE CLOSING WEEKS OF THIS DEBATE IS THAT WE TAKE THE POLITICAL AIR OUT OF THE BALLOON AND ASK OURSELVES WHAT WILL WORK FOR ORDINARY AMERICANS 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO REITERATED HIS FLEXIBILITY ON EMPLOYER MANDATES TODAY NOT THE FIRST TIME 
BUT THE GOVERNORS TOOK IT AS YET ANOTHER EXPRESSION OF MR. CLINTON'S WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ON HEALTH CARE
