SOMEWHAT 
IF CINDY CRAWFORD CAN TAKE THE TEST SO CAN YOU STARTING WITH A QUESTION WHO IS MORE MEN OR WOMEN 
DEFINITELY WOMEN 
ON THAT ONE MEN AND WOMEN AGREED THOUGH THEY APPARENTLY DON'T AGREE ON THE DEFINITION OF SENSUALITY 
TWO THIRDS OF MEN SURVEYED ADMITTED THAT THEY LINK SENSUALITY WITH SEX 
THE ROPER SENSUALITY SURVEY WAS COMMISSIONED BY REVLON TO COINCIDE WITH THE LAUNCH OF A NEW PERFUME

STRESS STRESS STRESS 
RIGHT EVEN KNOCKS OUT A KNOCKOUT LIKE CINDY CRAWFORD 
WOMEN SAID THEY EVEN FELT SENSUOUS WHILE ALONE 
I'M BY MYSELF 
WHILE MEN TENDED TO NEED COMPANY 
HOW OFTEN DID MOST PEOPLE FEEL SENSUOUS 
AT LEAST ONCE A DAY 
I WOULD SAY ONCE A DAY 
TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY

SOME PEOPLE SMELLED SOMETHING ABOUT US ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS

AND RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE WE MADE LOVE 
IT WAS NICE 
THE SURVEY DIDN'T MENTION 
THE MOST LOCALES CITED WERE A COZY FIREPLACE FOLLOWED BY A BEACH 
RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED WHETHER CERTAIN EXPERIENCES TENDED TO MAKE THEM FEEL SENSUOUS 
SOMEONE RUNNING AN ICE CUBE DOWN YOUR BACK 
NO THAT WOULD REALLY ANNOY ME 
OH BACK RUBS ARE DEFINITELY YEAH 
WATCHING A STEAMY LOVE SCENE 
POSSIBLY 
BEING PASSIONATELY KISSED 
KISSING IS GOOD YEAH
