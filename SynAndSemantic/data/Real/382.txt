THIS IS SURE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CLOSELY WATCHED TRIALS IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
C. N. N.'S ROBERT VITO HAS A LOOK AT THE JUDGE WHOSE JOB IT'LL BE TO WATCH OVER WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COURTROOM 
I'M ASSIGNING THE CASE TO JUDGE LANCE ITO 
LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE LANCE ITO A CAREER DISTRICT ATTORNEY BEFORE BEING APPOINTED TO THE BENCH 
HE IS A WELL RESPECTED JUDGE 
HE IS KNOWN AS A GUY WHO WILL CALL IT FAIRLY 
IT WAS A REAL MYSTERY WHO WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE O. J. SIMPSON MURDER CASE AND A REAL SURPRISE WHEN ITO WAS ASSIGNED TO IT BECAUSE HIS NAME WASN'T EVEN INCLUDED AMONG THE NINE JUDGES WHO WERE BEING CONSIDERED 
AND IN COURT THERE WAS A DISCLOSURE ABOUT ITO'S BACKGROUND THAT SOME BELIEVED MIGHT PROMPT DEFENSE ATTORNEYS TO ASK THAT ITO BE DISQUALIFIED 
BUT THEY DIDN'T 
JUDGE ITO IS MARRIED TO A CAPTAIN ON THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT 
SHE IS ASSIGNED TO THE FORGERY UNIT 
HE MAKES THIS DISCLOSURE AND IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER SIDE DESIRES HIM TO DO SO NO AFFIDAVIT WILL BE REQUIRED ON THE REQUEST OF EITHER SIDE HE WILL RECUSE HIMSELF FROM HANDLING THIS MATTER 
ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO STATE A POSITION ON THAT AT THIS TIME MR. SHAPIRO OR WOULD YOU WISH TO HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO CONFER WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES 
JUDGE ITO IS A CHOICE THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO US 
JUDGE ITO WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PEOPLE AS WELL 
JUDGE ITO IS MARRIED TO THE HIGHEST RANKING FEMALE OFFICER IN THE L. A. P. D. 
HE'S FORTY THREE YEARS OLD A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATE AND HE IS A MEMBER OF THE JAPANESE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 
JUDGE ITO IS NO STRANGER TO HIGH PROFILE CASES 
IT WAS ITO WHO PRESIDED OVER THE TRIAL OF CHARLES KEATING JUNIOR THE FORMER OWNER OF LINCOLN SAVINGS AND LOAN THE MOST NOTORIOUS CASE TO EMERGE FROM THE NATION'S SAVINGS AND LOAN DEBACLE 
HE'S NOT MERELY AN UMPIRE HE'LL SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE BUT HE'S SURELY GOING TO ALLOW THESE ATTORNEYS TO TRY THEIR CASE WITHOUT TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE 
IN A LEGAL PUBLICATION THAT ITO HE WAS REFERRED TO AS A MINIMALIST JUDGE WHO DREW HIGH MARKS FOR HIS LOW KEYED BUT CONTROLLED HANDLING OF THE KEATING CASE 
KEATING WAS CONVICTED OF LINCOLN INVESTORS 
ITO SENTENCED HIM TO THE MAXIMUM TEN YEARS IN STATE PRISON 
ITO SAID THE MAXIMUM TERM WAS JUSTIFIED BY IN DEFRAUDING CUSTOMERS 
ONE OF THE PROSECUTORS IN THAT CASE WAS WILLIAM HODGMAN THE SAME WILLIAM HODGMAN WHO IS A PROSECUTOR IN THE O. J. SIMPSON MURDER CASE 
I DON'T THINK THAT BECAUSE THESE TWO HAVE WORKED TOGETHER THAT THERE WILL BE ANY FAVORITISM SHOWN TO THE PROSECUTION 
EXCELLENT CHOICE 
EXCELLENT CHOICE 
WHY IS THAT 
BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF THE FINEST JUDGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
LEGAL EXPERTS HAD SAID THAT THE SIMPSON CASE NEEDED A JUDGE WHO WAS REALLY SMART REALLY PATIENT AND WITH A REPUTATION FOR BEING FAIR SOMEONE WHO'S AND NOT KNOWN AS SEEKING PUBLICITY AND WHO WORKS WELL UNDER PRESSURE 
AND THOSE LEGAL EXPERTS NOW SAY THE O. J. SIMPSON MURDER CASE GOT THE TRIAL JUDGE IT NEEDED

COMING UP ON THE WORLD TODAY PUTTING TODAY'S EVENTS IN THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE IN PERSPECTIVE
