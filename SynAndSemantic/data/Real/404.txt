TREASURY SECRETARY LLOYD BENTSEN'S YOUNG CHIEF OF STAFF JOSHUA STEINER WAS TOLD VERY BLUNTLY JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO IF YOU WERE WATCHING HERE ON C. N. N. THAT HE HAS A CONVENIENT MEMORY THE CRITICISM DIRECTLY COMING FROM A DEMOCRAT 
MR. SHELBY OF TENNESSEE AT ONE POINT NOTING THAT HE'S A VERY EDUCATED YOUNG MAN WENT TO NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND TO UNIVERSITY COLLEGE AT OXFORD 
HE SAID YOU'VE GOT A CONVENIENT MEMORY TODAY BUT THESE DIARIES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES DON'T THEY AND YOUNG JOSH STEINER SAID I'M HERE SENATOR UNDER OATH 
AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS TESTIMONY HE SOUGHT TO SOME OF THE ENTRIES 
HE SAID THAT HE WISHED THAT HIS ENTRIES HAD BEEN MORE ACCURATE 
THEY WERE NOT MEANT TO BE A PRECISE NARRATIVE 
NOW REPUBLICAN CONNIE MACK IS TALKING TO ONE OF THE WITNESSES 
AND WHAT WERE THOSE SURPRISES 
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED IS THAT A COUPLE OF OTHER REPORTERS HAD BEEN TALKING TO THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THIS MATTER 
I HAD SENATOR MACK BUT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING THERE TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION 
YES SIR 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHO WAS AT THE MEETING 
YES SIR 
FROM THE TREASURY IT WAS JEAN HANSON JOSH STEINER AND ME 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IT WAS BERNARD NUSSBAUM BRUCE LINDSEY MARK GEARAN AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES I DIDN'T KNOW WHO WERE IN AND OUT OF THE MEETING 
AND THE POINT THAT MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE AS I UNDERSTAND IT WERE ATTORNEYS DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE MEETING WAS ALL ABOUT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION 
WELL I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION FRANKLY THAT THIS WAS A MEETING THAT WAS CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCUSSING PRESS INQUIRIES AND I JUST I HAD JUST ASSUMED FRANKLY THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A MEETING OF PRESS TYPES AND WAS SURPRISED WHEN I SAW THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A GROUP OF ATTORNEYS 
WELL I WAS THERE OF COURSE AND I DEAL IN PRESS MATTERS 
MARK GEARAN WAS THERE HE WAS THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO SEE BRUCE LINDSEY THERE BUT I LEARNED THAT IN FACT MR. LINDSEY HANDLED PRESS INQUIRIES THAT INVOLVED MATTERS THAT HAD OCCURRED IN ARKANSAS 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRESS MEETING TO HAVE OTHERS SIT IN BECAUSE FOR SEVERAL REASONS NON PRESS PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES OFFER GOOD ADVICE TO PRESS PEOPLE 
WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE R. T. C. PRESS PERSON WAS NOT THERE 
NUMBER 
AND WHY NOT 
MY RECOLLECTION IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THE PRIMARY INFORMATION THE REPORTER WHO HAD TALKED TO ME WAS INTERESTED IN INVOLVED ENDORSEMENTS ON THE CHECKS THAT HAD BEEN CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FUNDRAISER BACK IN THE MID EIGHTY'S AND MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THE R. T. C. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WHEREAS THE WHITE HOUSE MIGHT 
WHY DID YOU NOT THINK THAT THE R. T. C. WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THOSE CHECKS 
WELL I JUST ASSUMED THAT SINCE THE SINCE THE FUNDS HAD BEEN CONTRIBUTED TO GOVERNOR CLINTON MOST CANDIDATES ARE CAREFUL TO KEEP RECORDS OF WHO MADE THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND I JUST ASSUMED THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE IT 
WHO DID WHO DID WHO WERE THE CHECKS FROM THAT WERE IN QUESTION 
I DON'T KNOW 
WAS MCDOUGAL ONE OF THEM 
I DON'T KNOW 
OKAY 
I BELIEVE YOU FORMALLY TESTIFIED THAT EARLIER THAT YOU EXCUSE ME YOU FORMALLY TESTIFIED THAT THE EARLIEST YOU EVER REMEMBER EVEN RECEIVING A PRESS INQUIRY WAS OCTOBER THE ELEVENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
IS THAT CORRECT 
THE EARLIEST I THAT'S CORRECT WITH ONE QUALIFICATION 
THE EARLIEST I RECEIVE RECALLING A PRESS INQUIRY WHICH LET ME KNOW THAT THE R. T. C. WAS ACTIVELY CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE THE MADISON GUARANTY SITUATION 
THAT CAME AS A SURPRISE TO ME 
AND WHEN WAS THAT DID YOU SAY 
OCTOBER THE ELEVENTH 
OKAY 
MISS HANSON TESTIFIED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ALTMAN CALLED YOU BOTH DOWN TO HIS OWN OFFICE FOR A MEETING ON OCTOBER THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
DO YOU RECALL THAT MEETING 
I DO NOT 
WELL SHE TESTIFIED THAT DURING THAT MEETING MR. ALTMAN WAS ENGAGED IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO THE PRESS INQUIRY MR. SP AND INQUIRY FROM MR. SP 
DOES THAT REFRESH YOUR RECOLLECTION 
NO SIR IT DOES NOT 
I DON'T RECALL THAT MEETING 
YOU DON'T RECALL THAT MEETING AT ALL 
NOT AT ALL 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU SENATOR MACK 
SENATOR KERRY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. CHAIRMAN 
WELCOME 
MR. STEINER I KNOW THIS IS THE LAST PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT YOU EVER IMAGINED YOURSELF BEING AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW IT'S HIGHLY UNCOMFORTABLE 
I KNOW OF YOU AS OTHERS DO AS A PERSON OF ENORMOUS ABILITY EXTREMELY TALENTED MORAL IDEALISTIC AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THAT LEAPS OUT OF YOUR DIARY AS A MATTER OF FACT 
I THINK YOUR CHARACTER WHICH I DON'T QUESTION I THINK YOU SHOW THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR CHARACTER IN YOUR OWN DIARY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PLACES 
YOUR JUDGMENT IS GOOD YOU SEE THINGS COMING YOU PERCEIVE THE DANGERS YOU SHOWED THE ACUMEN THAT I THINK WAS PRESENT IN YOUR BEING APPOINTED TO THE POSITION THAT YOU'RE IN 
AND INDEED YOU HAD THE GOOD COMMON SENSE WHEN GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS WAS FIRING OFF STEAM AND ANGRY AS ANYBODY WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY INCIDENTALLY I THINK BEING HONEST ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOUR REACTION WAS YOU PERSUADED GEORGE THAT DOING ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN STUPID AND IMPROPER IN TERMS OF STEPHENS AND IT COOLED DOWN BUT THAT WAS GOOD JUDGMENT 
IN ADDITION YOU DREW LESSONS 
YOU SAID THAT THE LESSON OF ALL OF THIS IS DO WHAT YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT THING EARLY RECUSE 
YOU SAID REMEMBER THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE ASKED ABOUT UNDER OATH 
DON'T LET THE WHITE HOUSE GET INVOLVED IN ANY WAY 
THESE ARE ALL GOOD INSTINCTS 
AND INDEED YOU DIDN'T DRAW THE WRONG LESSON YOU ALSO LATER ON SAID SUCH AN INCREDIBLE CITY BEEN BATTLING WITH R. T. C. MADISON WROTE TWO PAGES ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON SUDDENLY REALIZED I COULD BE SUBPOENAED LIKE PACKWOOD'S AND THE MOST INNOCUOUS COMMENTS COULD BE TAKE OUT OF CONTEXT SO ON THAT SUBJECT NOTHING 
AND YOU DIDN'T DESTROY YOUR DIARY 
YOU LEFT YOU DIARY WE HAVE IT 
SO I THINK THERE IS IN ALL OF THIS A VERY REFRESHING KIND OF TRUTHFULNESS ALMOST INNOCENT OBSERVATION OF THE GOINGS ON OF WASHINGTON 
AND IT THEREFORE SORT OF TROUBLES ME A LITTLE BIT THAT YOU NOW WANT TO DISTANCE YOURSELF TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OR TRY TO CAST SOME NUANCES ON IT THOUGH I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
I WANT TO TRY TO EXPLORE IT A BIT 
THERE ARE FIVE SEPARATE REFERRALS IN YOUR TWO EXTRACTIONS TO THE SUBJECT OF 
FIRST YOU SAY THAT SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF OR SHOULD HE STAY INVOLVED YOU DISCUSS THE HURDLE AND THAT'S BETWEEN THE FIRST MONTH JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH AND FEBRUARY TWELFTH 
THEN LATER ON BETWEEN FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH AND TWENTY SEVENTH SO WE'RE SPANNING THE PERIOD OF ABOUT A MONTH HERE YOU THEN SAY FOR WEEKS WE HAVE BEEN BATTLING OVER HOW SHOULD HANDLE THE INVESTIGATION 
INITIALLY WE ALL FELT HE SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF 
THEN YOU HAVE THIS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING IT WAS UNACCEPTABLE 
THEN YOU SAY AT THE HEARING THE AMAZINGLY DID NOT COME UP WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT THIS GREAT TOPIC OF DIDN'T COME UP 
THEN YOU SAY THE NEXT DAY THE NEW YORK TIMES RAN A FRONT PAGE STORY 
THE HEAT WAS ON 
WE SPENT A TORTURED DAY WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO BY SENATOR SHELBY TRYING TO DECIDE IF HE SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF 
AGAIN IS FRONT AND CENTER 
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN DESPITE ALL OF THIS TORTURE DESPITE ALL OF THESE WEEKS OF DISCUSSIONS DESPITE ALL OF THE PRESSURE HOWELL RAINES SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO ELICIT FROM ROGER ALTMAN WHAT NO ONE ELSE COULD WHICH WAS A QUICK ON THE TELEPHONE 
AND AGAIN THE IS SORT OF FRONT AND CENTER 
NOW IF YOU GO INTO YOUR PREPARATION OF ALL OF THE QUESTIONS FOR MR. ALTMAN APPEARING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WHY ARE YOU UNWILLING TO RECUSE YOURSELF AND HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION OR THE SUGGESTION WAS WELL I WILL NOT WHAT IS IT I WILL NOT PLAY ANY ROLE IN THE R. T. C.'S EVENTUAL DECISION 
I WILL NOT BE DOING SO 
I WILL THEREFORE HAVE NO ROLE IN THE R. T. C.'S DECISIONS ON THE MATTER 
NEXT YOU SHOULD STILL RECUSE YOURSELF 
WHY DON'T YOU 
AS I SAID I'LL HAVE NO ROLE IN THE R. T. C. DECISIONS ON PURSUING THE CLAIM 
THESE ARE ALL PHRASED THESE ARE NOT THE ACTUAL ANSWERS THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS 
BUT MOST OF ALL SENATOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH THAT I'LL NOT BE PLAYING ANY ROLE 
AGAIN DOESN'T YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT AND MRS. CLINTON REQUIRE 
ANSWER AGAIN BEING PROPOSED I'LL NOT BE PLAYING ANY ROLE THEREFORE THERE WON'T BE ANY APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT 
I AM ABSOLUTELY STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT BEING SUCH A DISCUSSION WHY YOU SPENT DAYS ON THIS ISSUE 
IF HE ISN'T GOING TO HAVE ANY ROLE IF HE ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ANY DECISION IF HE ISN'T GOING TO BE INVOLVED THEN WHY DID IT MATTER WHETHER HE STAYED OR NOT 
NOW YOU'VE SAID HERE THERE ARE ONLY TWO REASONS FOR HIS STAYING THE PRECEDENT AND THE GUARANTEE IMPARTIALITY 
HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE IMPARTIALITY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY ANY ROLE 
I BELIEVE SENATOR THAT WOULD BE TWO QUESTIONS WHICH I SHOULD ADDRESS MYSELF TO 
FIRST IS WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS SUBJECT AND THE SECOND IS HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE IMPARTIALITY 
I'M SORRY 
I APOLOGIZE 
TWO QUESTIONS 
THE FIRST I SUSPECT THAT I PLACED MORE EMPHASIS IN MY DIARY ON THIS SUBJECT THAN PERHAPS OTHER PARTICIPANTS MIGHT WHICH IS TO SAY I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I CONTINUED TO CONSIDER IT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AFTER MR. ALTMAN HAD MADE HIS INITIAL DECISION ON FEBRUARY THIRD 
AND SO I SUSPECT MY DIARY REFLECTS MY OWN BELIEF THAT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT MAY NOT FULLY CAPTURE THE EMPHASIS OR ATTENTION OTHER PEOPLE PAID TO IT 
THE SECOND POINT THAT YOU MAKE WHICH IS HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE IMPARTIALITY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED I THINK MR. ALTMAN HAD SAID REPEATEDLY BOTH TO R. T. C. AND TO TREASURY STAFF THAT HE WANTED THIS CASE HANDLED IN A COMPLETELY IMPARTIAL NON POLITICAL FASHION 
I THINK THAT'S HOW YOU GUARANTEE IMPARTIALITY 
WELL I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU CAN IF YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED AND YOU'RE NOT PLAYING ANY ROLE YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON 
TO GUARANTEE IMPARTIALITY YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION YOU HAVE TO SAY NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT OR DON'T PURSUE THIS OR DON'T PURSUE THAT 
IF YOU'RE GENUINELY LEAVING THE INVESTIGATION UP TO WHAT ON EARTH WAS THERE TO REMAIN INVOLVED FOR 
WELL SENATOR I THINK MR. ALTMAN SENT OUT A CLEAR DIRECTION HAS TO HOW HE WANTED THIS CASE HANDLED AND THAT'S WHAT EXECUTIVES OFTEN DO 
THEY MAY GIVE CLEAR DIRECTION AS TO HOW THEY WANT SOMETHING TO PROCEED AND 
WAS THERE ANY INDICATION FROM MR. RYAN OR MS. THAT IT WOULD PROCEED ANY WAY THAN OTHERWISE 
I DON'T BELIEVE SO NO SENATOR 
THEN WHAT WAS THE CONCERN 
WELL I THINK THE CONCERN AS I MENTIONED WAS EXPRESSED BY MR. NUSSBAUM 
I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY MR. NUSSBAUM AND HE'LL BE HERE AS WITH OTHERS TO EXPLAIN IT 
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I MEAN I THINK YOUR DIARY IS VERY REFRESHING I THINK IT'S VERY HONEST 
I KNOW YOU 
I KNOW YOU'RE HONEST AND I KNOW THE IDEALISM WITH WHICH YOU APPROACH THIS PROCESS 
I THINK YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT THE HIGHEST PUBLIC MOTIVES AT STAKE 
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WE NEED INVOLVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE 
SO I TAKE THIS VERY I MEAN YOU CERTAINLY WEREN'T WRITING THE DIARY FOR THE PURPOSES OF BEING WERE YOU 
SENATOR ABSOLUTELY NOT 
BUT 
I ASSUME YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE MOST ACCURATE DIARY YOU COULD HAVE HAD DIDN'T YOU 
I WANT TO REPEAT SENATOR IF I COULD AND I'M SURE TO WRITE A PRECISE NARRATIVE OR TO GIVE AN EXACT CHRONOLOGY OF WHAT TOOK PLACE 
OVER THE PAST FIVE MONTHS I'VE HAD TO LIVE WITH THIS DOCUMENT AND I'VE HAD TO GO AND TESTIFY UNDER OATH ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT I KNEW AND EXACTLY WHAT I THINK OCCURRED AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO FOR YOU TODAY AND 
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT 
MY TIME IS UP 
I DON'T WANT TO CUT YOU OFF AT ALL 
MY TIME IS UP AND I WANT TO STICK BY THE TIME LIMITS 
THANK YOU 
SENATOR FAIRCLOTH 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN 
AND I'LL GO TO MR. STEINER ALSO 
AND IF YOU WILL PULL THAT MICROPHONE REAL CLOSE AND SPEAK A LITTLE SLOWER 
YES SIR 
YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU BELIEVE ROGER ALTMAN WAS CANDID WITH THE COMMITTEE YET YOU WROTE IN YOUR DIARY THAT ALTMAN GRACEFULLY DUCKED THE ISSUE 
IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT BEING CANDID AND GRACEFULLY DUCKING ARE CONSISTENT 
SENATOR I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE DUCKED ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
I DON'T BELIEVE HE WAS ASKED ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WELL WHAT ABOUT GRACEFULLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GRACEFULLY DUCKING THE ISSUE 
THE ALLUSION HERE SENATOR IS NOT TO THE ISSUE THE ALLUSION IS TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING TREASURY WHITE HOUSE CONTACTS 
AND 
YEAH MEETINGS OF DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME AVOIDING ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON THE ISSUE WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE DUCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN 
SENATOR AS I SAID 
GIVE ME YOUR DESCRIPTION OF DUCKING A QUESTION 
SENATOR AS I SAID I THINK MR. ALTMAN WAS TRUTHFUL IN HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE YOU 
IS TRUTHFUL AND DUCKING CONSISTENT IN TESTIMONY 
I THINK MR. ALTMAN WAS ASKED A QUESTION WHICH HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE 
AND HE ANSWERED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED HIM TO CONVEY THE INFORMATION IN THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE WAY THAT HE COULD 
JOSH IF I MIGHT WHAT QUESTION ARE YOU REFERRING TO THAT HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE 
I BELIEVE HE WAS ASKED ABOUT TREASURY WHITE HOUSE CONTACTS 
WOULD IT CHANGE YOUR MIND IF YOU WERE TO KNOW THAT THE EVENING BEFORE IN A CONVERSATION WITH ME THAT I HAD ADVISED HIM THAT WE WOULD BE ASKING HIM DIRECTLY WHAT CONTACTS HE HAD AND TREASURY HAD WITH THE WHITE HOUSE 
WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT PHONE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH MR. ALTMAN 
NO I WAS NOT SENATOR 
WELL WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR MIND 
SENATOR 
IF I TOLD HIM THE EVENING BEFORE WE ARE GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT CONTACTS YOU OR TREASURY OR YOUR STAFF AND THE STAFF OF THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE HAD 
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT HE GRACEFULLY DUCKED THE QUESTIONS HE KNEW WAS GOING TO BE ASKED 
WELL SENATOR LET ME 
I MEAN THE WHOLE THING IS THAT HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO BE ASKED 
HE WASN'T SURPRISED 
AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT HE VERY GRACEFULLY DUCKED THEM 
SO IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T KNOW MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DUCKING AND LYING 
SENATOR IF I MIGHT IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE THAT TESTIMONY TODAY I WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY CHOOSE DIFFERENT WORDS 
WHAT NOW 
IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE THE TESTIMONY TODAY 
OH I'M SURE OF THAT 
I DIDN'T LAUGHTER I NEVER DOUBTED THAT 
LORD HAVE MERCY 
I KNEW YOU'D USE DIFFERENT WORDS TODAY 
BUT YOU TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DUCKING AND LYING 
SENATOR AS I SAID BEFORE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MR. ALTMAN LIED TO THIS COMMITTEE OR ATTEMPTED TO MISLEAD THIS COMMITTEE 
I BELIEVE HE SPOKE TRUTHFULLY AND TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE 
IF NOT MISLEADING DUCKING IS MISLEADING 
NOW WHAT DOES LYING DO 
SENATOR AS I SAID I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT MR. ALTMAN LIED TO THIS COMMITTEE 
BUT HE DUCKED 
SENATOR I THINK HE WAS ASKED A QUESTION WHICH HE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE 
IN FACT YOU KIND OF ADMIRED HIS DUCKING BECAUSE YOU SAID HE DUCKED GRACEFULLY RATHER THAN 
LAUGHTER 
I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT'S NICER DUCKING THAN KIND OF STUMBLING THROUGH A DUCK THAN TO GRACEFULLY DUCK 
MR. FOREMAN 
YES SIR 
IN YOUR DEPOSITION YOU TESTIFIED ABOUT A CONVERSATION YOU HAD WITH BETH NOLAN WHO WORKED FOR BILL CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
IN THAT CONVERSATION YOU SAID THAT YOU TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW LEADERSHIP AT THE R. T. C. IN OTHER WORDS SOMEBODY BESIDES ALTMAN 
YOU SAID THAT THE CONCERN WAS THAT THE NEW LEADERSHIP MIGHT AND I QUOTE COME UP WITH SOME OFF THE WALL DECISIONS RELATIVE TO THE MADISON CIVIL CASE 
MR. FOREMAN AS ETHICS DIRECTOR WHY SHOULD YOU CARE WHETHER SOMEONE OTHER THAN ROGER ALTMAN MADE THE DECISION ABOUT MADISON GUARANTY CIVIL CASE 
YOU'RE THE ETHICS DIRECTOR 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GRADING THEM NOT DIRECTING THEM 
SENATOR EXCUSE ME 
WERE YOU STOPPED 
I DID NOT THAT WAS NOT MY COMMENT FROM MY HEAD 
I WAS PASSING ON SOMETHING THAT I HAD HEARD 
WAIT A MINUTE NOW 
WHAT NOW 
WHO WERE YOU PASSING IT ON FROM 
TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION MS. HANSON SAID TO ME SOMETHING LIKE THERE WAS CONCERN BECAUSE THE OTHER LEADERSHIP IN THE R. T. C. WAS BRAND NEW IN THEIR POSITIONS AND SOMEONE HAD EXPRESSED A CONCERN THAT THERE WAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH THE THOROUGHNESS AND FAIRNESS WITH WHICH THEY MADE DECISIONS 
AND THAT WAS THE BASIS OF THE COMMENT THAT I PASSED ON TO MS. NOLAN 
WELL I WOULD THINK THE ETHICS DIRECTOR YOU'RE SOMEWHAT OF A JUDGE 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SORT OF SETTING THE EXAMPLE 
ISN'T THAT RIGHT 
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO 
ALL RIGHT SO YOU WORRIED ABOUT PASSING ON INFORMATION AS TO WHO MIGHT COME UP WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE WOULD PRODUCE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME FROM WHAT YOU ALL WERE HOPING FOR 
SENATOR THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT COMMENT GOES TOWARD 
ONE OF THE FACTORS WHEN ONE LOOKS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO MAKE A DISCRETIONARY DECISION OF WHETHER TO RECUSE IS LOOKING AT THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MAKING THE DECISION IF THAT PERSON DOESN'T 
IT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS LISTED IN SECTION FIVE HUNDRED TWO 
I WAS MERELY PASSING ON A COMMENT THAT SOMEONE HAD MADE TO ME 
LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION AND IF YOU WILL BE SHORTER IN YOUR ANSWER MR. FOREMAN IN DEPOSITIONS WE HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU HAD A CONVERSATION WITH JEAN HANSON WHO TESTIFIED HERE YESTERDAY FOR EIGHT HOURS 
IN THAT CONVERSATION YOU AND JEAN HANSON TALKED THE CONCERN THAT ELLEN WOULD BE THE ONE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT MADISON GUARANTY 
YESTERDAY WE LEARNED THAT ELLEN IS REGARDED AS BEING A TOUGH LAWYER 
IF YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISION OR WHETHER TO FILE CIVIL CASES IN THE MADISON MATTER WHY WERE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT A TOUGH LAWYER BEING THE ONE TO MAKE THE DECISION 
I WASN'T CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT A TOUGH LAWYER MAKING THE DECISION 
THAT WAS FINE WITH ME 
I HAD NO VIEW ON THE QUESTION OF WHO WOULD BE MAKING THE DECISION 
MY ONLY INTEREST WAS THAT SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED THIS WHICH IS A FACTOR RELATED TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MAKING THE DECISION IF ROGER DIDN'T 
I PERSONALLY HAD NO CONCERN ABOUT THAT AND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT MR. ALTMAN SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF FROM THIS MATTER 
BERNARD NUSSBAUM COMPLAINED TO JEAN HANSON BEFORE ABOUT THE CHOICE OF ELLEN THE PERSON WHO WILL MAKE THE DECISION IN THE MADISON MATTER 
NUSSBAUM TWICE WANTED TO KNOW HOW GOT HIRED WITHOUT BEING CLEARED BY HIM EVEN THOUGH THE R. T. C. IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY 
THE HOUSE WANTED TO MAKE THE MADISON GUARANTY CIVIL CASES TAKE THE CASES AWAY FROM ELLEN INSTEAD PUT THE DECISION IN THE HANDS OF ROBERT FISKE 
WHY WOULD THE WHITE HOUSE WANT TO REPLACE A LAWYER THAT THEY THINK IS TOO TOUGH WITH ROBERT FISKE 
WERE THEY THINKING HE'D BE SOFTER 
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT THAT SENATOR 
I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THAT AT THE TIME AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYONE MAY HAVE BEEN THINKING WHO SAID THAT 
BY THEY WANTED TO REPLACE WITH FISKE SO 
SENATOR I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT 
ALL I I REMEMBER MS. HANSON MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT LOOKING AT THE SCOPE OF MR. FISKE'S RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND I REMEMBER SOMEONE MAKING A COMMENT THAT IT INCLUDED CIVIL CLAIMS 
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT 
ONE MORE QUICK 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO DO SIR 
ONE MORE QUICK QUESTION 
LET ME JUST SAY LET ME JUST SAY THE TIME HAS EXPIRED 
IF YOU'VE GOT ONE FOLLOW UP WE'RE ABOUT TO GO AND VOTE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO RECESS 
I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION 
IF YOU COULD ASK IT QUICKLY WE'LL DO IT AND THEN RECESS 
DID YOU TALK WITH ROBERT FISKE BEFORE HE MADE A DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE ANYBODY IN THIS MATTER 
NO SIR 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU 
NOW THE COMMITTEE IS GOING TO RECESS BRIEFLY 
WE'VE GOT THREE VOTES IN A ROW 
THE LAST TWO VOTES HAVE 
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR LIVE COVERAGE OF THESE WHITEWATER HEARINGS BEFORE THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE 
AND ONE THING TO OUR VERY FINE VIEWERS IN ALABAMA I DID NOT MEAN TO STEAL YOUR SENATOR FROM YOU 
I IDENTIFIED RICHARD SHELBY AS BEING A DEMOCRAT FROM TENNESSEE 
MY APOLOGY 
HE'S INDEED FROM ALABAMA 
WE SHOULD TELL YOU THAT C. N. N. WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE WEEK COVERING THESE WHITEWATER HEARINGS 
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON THE DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY ROGER ALTMAN WILL BE IN THE HOT SEAT FOR MANY MANY HOURS AND C. N. N. WILL COVER ALL OF IT LIVE
