THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO FIND THE KEYS TO ETHNIC HARMONY 
ANALYSIS OF THE NINETEEN NINETY CENSUS DATA IS PAINTING A PORTRAIT OF THE UNITED STATES MARKED BY DIVERSITY 
AS C. N. N.'S JAMIE MCINTYRE REPORTS SOME FEAR THE DIVERSE POPULATIONS COULD FOSTER CONFLICTING PURPOSES 
SAY THE CALIFORNIA OF TODAY THE AMERICA OF TOMORROW 
MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND MORE POLITICALLY DIVISIVE 
IN CALIFORNIA THE TERM MINORITY IS BEGINNING TO SOUND OBSOLETE 
ONE OF EVERY FOUR CALIFORNIA CITIES ABOVE FIFTY THOUSAND IN POPULATION HAS NO RACIAL OR ETHNIC MAJORITY OF ANY KIND 
IN OTHER WORDS POPULATION EXPERTS SAY THE OLD AMERICAN MELTING POT IS BECOMING MORE OF AN ETHNIC MOSAIC 
THERE'S BEEN MORE INCREASE IN ETHNIC DIVERSITY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE GREAT WAVES OF IMMIGRATION AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 
IMMIGRATION AND HIGHER BIRTH RATES ACCOUNTED FOR THE BIG INCREASES IN MINORITY POPULATIONS IN THE EIGHTIES 
THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS HISPANIC JUMPED FIFTY THREE PERCENT TO NINE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION 
THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ROSE THIRTEEN PERCENT AND NOW MAKE UP TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION 
ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS WERE THE FASTEST GROWING GROUP UP ONE HUNDRED EIGHT PERCENT BUT ARE ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION 
AND WHITES WHICH INCLUDE SOME HISPANICS GREW JUST SIX PERCENT BUT ARE STILL EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL AMERICANS 
BUT SAY NOT ONLY IS THE FACE OF AMERICA BECOMING LESS WHITE IT'S GETTING MORE WRINKLES TOO 
AND EXPERTS SAY THAT LONG PREDICTED OF AMERICA IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR A CLASH BETWEEN TWO OF THE FASTEST GROWING GROUPS YOUNGER MINORITIES AND OLDER WHITES 
TEN YEARS AGO AMERICANS SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER MADE UP ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION 
BY NINETEEN NINETY THE PERCENTAGE WAS CLOSER TO THIRTEEN PERCENT 
BUT PROJECTIONS FORECAST THAT NUMBER WILL NEARLY DOUBLE BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE TO MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT AS BABY BOOMERS HIT OLD AGE 
WELL THIS SHIFT IS ALREADY HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES 
FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE RECENTLY SEEN COMMUNITIES WHERE OLDER MOSTLY WHITE VOTERS DEFEATED SCHOOL BOND ISSUES WHERE CHILDREN ARE MOSTLY MINORITY CHILDREN 
THE LESSON SAYS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE EXAMINING CENSUS TRENDS IS THAT CONGRESS MUST WORK NOT ONLY ON TODAY'S FIRES OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC CONTENT BUT ENGAGE IN SOME FIRE PREVENTION FOR THE FUTURE 
IF WE DON'T WE'LL DO NOTHING BUT FIGHT FIRES WELL INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
