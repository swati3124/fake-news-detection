NEARLY HALF A CENTURY AFTER D. DAY THE WOUNDS OF WAR STILL RUN DEEP FOR ONE FRENCH FAMILY 
THE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE HOPING FOR A REUNION THAT WILL RECONCILE THEM TO THAT PAINFUL DAY AND HELP THEM MAKE PEACE WITH THE AMERICAN SOLDIER WHO HAS HAUNTED THEM EVER SINCE 
C. N. N.'S RICHARD BLYSTONE HAS THE STORY 
FIFTY YEARS THEY KEPT IT BOTTLED UP 
NOW THE FAMILY WANT TO GET IT OUT AND OVER TO FIND THE AMERICAN SOLDIER WHO KILLED THEIR BABY AND TELL HIM IT'S ALL RIGHT 
HE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT WAS A FAMILY HUDDLED HERE IN A TRENCH BEHIND THE FARMHOUSE 
FATE SAYS BERNARD IS LIKE THAT 
NO POINT IN CASTING BLAME 
C'EST LA THAT'S WAR 
WAR FOR THE HAMLET OF LE ROCHE BEGAN WITH THE DRONE OF BOMBERS 
DISTANT THUNDER FROM THE NORMANDY BEACHES 
BUT SOON THE ALLIES WERE DRIVING TOWARD THE PORT OF CHERBOURG 
EARLY ON THE MORNING OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THE PEACE OF THIS ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE WAS BLOWN APART BY GUNFIRE AND THE FAMILY FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE FRONT LINE OF THE ALLIED INVASION OF NORMANDY 
THEY HAD BEEN IN THEIR TRENCH ALL DAY 
BERNARD HIS WIFE EIGHT YEAR OLD MAURICE AGE SIX AND GUY AGE ONE 
DEAFENING GUNFIRE FROM THE AMERICANS IN THE FIELD TO THE LEFT FROM THE GERMANS IN THE ORCHARD TO THE RIGHT 
THEN BULLETS RAKED THE TRENCH 
ONE HIT BERNARD ANOTHER WOUNDED HIS WIFE 
AND THREE TORE THE BABY FROM HER KNEE 
THE OTHER CHILDREN BEAR THEIR SCARS INSIDE 
I REMEMBER BEING AMAZED I WASN'T WOUNDED AND I WONDERED HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE 
HER FATHER WENT OUT WAVING A WHITE CLOTH TO BEG THEM TO STOP 
THEN THEY SAW THE AMERICAN 
HE MADE GESTURES WITH HIS HANDS AND HE LOOKED DEVASTATED 
THE SHOOTING PAUSED THE SOLDIER GAVE THEM POWDER FOR THE WOUNDS AND THEY FLED TO THE HOUSE WITH THEIR DYING BABY 
HAD ANOTHER BOY AND NAMED HIM ALSO GUY 
HE GREW UP IN PEACE BUT HAUNTED BY THAT DAY OF WAR AND THE SOLDIER WHOSE LIFE WAS BOUND UP WITH THEIRS WHO MAY HAVE LIVED FIFTY YEARS WITH REMORSE 
AS TIME PASSED THEY REGRETTED MORE THEY HAD NEVER TRIED TO FILL THE GAP IN THEIR FAMILY HISTORY 
THEY SEARCHED THEIR MEMORIES DREW DIAGRAMS WROTE LETTERS 
LEARNED HE WAS MAYBE FROM NEW YORK MAYBE FROM THE SECOND BATTALION OF THE FORTY SEVENTH REGIMENT OF THE U. S. NINTH DIVISION 
MAYBE IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE MAYBE HE NEVER EVEN MADE IT HOME 
THEY KNOW THAT 
WE WOULD GO AND PUT FLOWERS ON HIS GRAVE 
BUT MAYBE HE'LL COME BACK FOR THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY 
THAT SAYS GUY WOULD BE AMAZING 
AND THEN I COULD SAY THE CHAPTER HAS ENDED 
AT EIGHTY THREE BERNARD WANTS TO WASTE NO TIME FOR THE CHAPTER IS CLOSING ON HIM AS WELL
