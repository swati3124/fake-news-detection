FIRST THIS NEWS 
IT'S ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
I'M LINDA WERTHEIMER 
AND I'M NOAH ADAMS 
PRESIDENT CLINTON MET TODAY WITH EMPLOYEES OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET 
THIS GROUP HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HELPING THE PRESIDENT PREPARE AN ECONOMIC PLAN THAT INCREASES INVESTMENT AND CUTS THE DEFICIT AT THE SAME TIME 
MR. CLINTON TOLD THEM HE PLANS TO REDUCE WHITE HOUSE SPENDING A GESTURE HE HOPES WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE CONGRESS 
NPR'S ELIZABETH ARNOLD REPORTS 
PRESIDENT CLINTON WALKED ACROSS THE STREET TODAY AND MADE A SURPRISE APPEARANCE AT A STAFF MEETING OF EMPLOYEES AT THE BUDGET OFFICE 
TOMORROW IS THE AGENCY'S DEADLINE FOR ALL OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES OF THE LEVEL OF REDUCTIONS THEY'LL FACE IN MR. CLINTON'S FIRST BUDGET 
SETTING THE TONE OF SHARED SACRIFICE THE PRESIDENT SAID HE TOO WOULD DO HIS PART 
IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS I WILL BE FINALIZING AND ANNOUNCING PLANS WHICH WILL DEMONSTRATE A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN SPENDING AT THE WHITE HOUSE REVERSING MANY YEARS OF GROWTH IN SERVICES AND PERSONNEL PROVIDED TO THE PRESIDENT 
THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO JUGGLE THE NUMBERS TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF SPENDING REDUCTIONS 
DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S CALCULATED IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE BOTH GREW AND SHRANK 
TODAY THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT MAKING STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO SAVE MONEY 
HE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ANTIQUATED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS HE INHERITED AND INTENDS TO UPDATE 
I COULD NOT HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL IN MY OFFICE ON MY TELEPHONE EXCEPT AN UNWANTED ONE 
ANYBODY IN THE CENTRAL OFFICE COULD PUNCH A LIGHTED BUTTON AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I THINK WOULD BE PRETTY SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED THAT AFTER A DOZEN YEARS OF PEOPLE WHO PROMISED TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT LIKE A BUSINESS THEY MEANT A BUSINESS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES NOT FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
LIKE BUSINESS MR. CLINTON SAID GOVERNMENT MUST ALSO GRADUALLY DOWNSIZE 
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED ANY OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC PLAN ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS TRIAL BALLOONS HAVE BEEN FLOATED AND BROAD HINTS HAVE BEEN DROPPED 
ADMINISTRATION SOURCES CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THE PRESIDENT IS CONSIDERING CUTTING EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE MILITARY BUDGET HE INHERITED FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR 
ON THE REVENUE SIDE TWICE IN HIS SPEECH TODAY MR. CLINTON SUGGESTED HE WOULD NOT ASK ANYONE IN THE WORKING MIDDLE CLASS TO PAY MORE IN TAXES UNTIL HE HAS ASKED WEALTHIER AMERICANS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE 
WHILE INCREASED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY IS NOT A NEW IDEA THERE IS A NEW EMPHASIS ON HOW THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL ALSO BE EXPECTED TO PITCH IN 
SINCE THE ELECTION MR. CLINTON SAID TODAY WE'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF BUDGETS AND PUTTING TOGETHER A PROGRAM THAT PUTS PEOPLE TO WORK AND DEALS WITH THE LONG TERM DEFICIT PROBLEM 
SINCE NO ONE HAS EVER TRIED TO DO BOTH THESE THINGS AT ONCE TO GET THE JOB BASE GOING WHICH WE WANT TO DO WITH A MODEST STIMULUS PROGRAM IN THE BEGINNING INCREASE PERMANENTLY INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE AND JOBS AND GROWTH AND REDUCE THE DEFICIT IT IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT SPECIFIC DECISIONS WE MUST MAKE 
BUT THE GENERAL PATH WE HAVE TO FOLLOW IS CLEAR 
THE GENERAL PATH IS NOT AS SMOOTH AS THE ONE MR. CLINTON PROMISED DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND HE MUST CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT IT'S STILL WORTH TAKING 
NEXT WEEK LEADING UP TO HIS ECONOMIC ADDRESS HE GOES OUT ON THE ROAD TO MAKE HIS CASE DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE BEGINNING HIS PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN WITH A LIVE INTERACTIVE TELEVISION BROADCAST FROM DETROIT
