WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC IN MOST CASES YOUNG STUDENTS HAVE TO PAY IN ORDER TO PLAY 
THAT'S NOT SO THOUGH IN THE CASE OF ONE CHICAGO SCHOOL 
C. N. N.'S KOCH MOYERS REPORTS 
MUSIC HITTING ALL THE RIGHT NOTES 
RITA DREAM FOR HER STUDENTS IN CHICAGO'S GRITTY UPTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD 
THE PEOPLE'S MUSIC SCHOOL EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD NOW AND STILL A SINGLE MISSION 
IF YOU HAVE TALENT AND YOU WANT TO LEARN WHY SHOULD YOU BE PENALIZED BECAUSE YOU'RE POOR 
POOR PERHAPS BUT RICH IN POTENTIAL 
THEY COME HERE BECAUSE IT'S FREE AND BECAUSE THE CASH POOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE CUT MUSIC CLASSES TO ONLY AN HOUR A WEEK 
INTERVIEWS I LEARNED NEWS SONGS AND I'M STARTING TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR 
I LIKE THE MUSIC AND THE INSTRUMENTS LIKE I'VE GOT A VIOLIN 
AND I PLAY EACH AND EVERY DAY 
SOUNDS OF SUCCESS NOT ALWAYS SWEET MUSIC BUT IT WORKS 
WHEN THEY ARE HERE THEY ARE NOT OUT ON THE STREETS CREATING TROUBLE 
AND THAT'S A SUCCESS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD 
SUCCESS STORIES FOUR THOUSAND INCLUDING THIS HARVARD GRADUATE WHO LEARNED MORE THAN MUSIC 
I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT GIVING BACK TO A COMMUNITY THAT GIVES YOU SOMETHING AND A LOT ABOUT RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY DO 
THIS SCHOOL IS FOR EVERYBODY THAT LIKE TO LEARN AND DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO PAY 
AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM OR MONEY 
UNDAUNTED RITA BROKE GROUND LAST MONTH FOR A MUCH LARGER SCHOOL FOR THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS 
SHE'S BANKING ON GRANTS DONATIONS AND BAKE SALES TO RAISE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS 
ALL PART OF THE UPS AND DOWNS OF A SCHOOL THAT GIVES VOICE TO DREAMS
