WE'RE INTERRUPTING THIS STORY TO GO LIVE TO ADMIRAL MIKE BOORDA COMMANDER OF NATO'S SOUTHERN FORCES 
HE'S SPEAKING IN NAPLES ABOUT TODAY'S ACTION OVER BOSNIA 
THIS CONTACT WAS HEADING SOUTH AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY KNOTS 
THE AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT TWO NATO DENY FLIGHT FIGHTERS UNITED STATES F. SIXTEENS TOWARD THE TRACK 
AND YOU CAN SEE THEY CAME UP FROM THE SOUTH FROM THE VICINITY OF MOSTAR 
THE LEAD FIGHTER REPORTED RADAR CONTACT AND THEN REQUESTED PERMISSION TO DESCEND TO GET A VISUAL IDENTIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PROCEDURES AND THAT PERMISSION WAS GRANTED 
THE FIGHTER THEN REPORTED VISUAL CONTACT WITH TWO AIRCRAFT WHICH HE IDENTIFIED AS 
AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER WITH FOUR MORE WHO WERE FLYING AHEAD OF THE TWO HE FIRST SAW 
AT OH FIVE THREE FIVE THE NATO AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PROCEDURES ISSUED WARNINGS TO THE VIOLATORS TO LAND OR EXIT THE AIRSPACE IMMEDIATELY OR BE ENGAGED 
NO RESPONSE WAS NOTED BY THE AIRCRAFT 
AT OH FIVE FOUR TWO THE FIGHTERS AGAIN WARNED THE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PROCEDURES AND NO RESPONSE WAS NOTED 
AT OH FIVE FOUR THREE AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS WAS ALL HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY 
AT OH FIVE FOUR THREE PERMISSION TO ENGAGE THE VIOLATING WAS GRANTED 
AND JUST PRIOR TO THE ENGAGEMENT THE FLIGHT LEADER OF THE NATO FIGHTERS SAW THE MAKE A BOMBING MANEUVER AND THEN HE SAW EXPLOSIONS ON THE GROUND 
WE HAVE RECEIVED UNCONFIRMED AND I STRESS AT THIS TIME THEY'RE STILL UNCONFIRMED REPORTS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS FORCES COMMAND IN YUGOSLAVIA FORMER YUGOSLAVIA THAT FACILITIES IN THIS VICINITY WERE ALLEGEDLY HIT BY AS MANY AS EIGHT BOMBS PERHAPS MORE ONE OF WHICH HIT A STORAGE FACILITY AND ANOTHER A HOSPITAL 
MORE INFORMATION ON THIS REPORT WILL COME FROM THE UNITED NATIONS COMMAND WHEN AND IF THEY ARE ABLE TO CONFIRM IT 
BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT WHAT OUR PILOTS SAW CORRESPONDS EXACTLY WITH THIS REPORT 
AT OH FIVE FOUR FIVE OH FIVE FOUR FIVE GREENWICH MEAN TIME THE LEAD NATO FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FIRED AN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MISSILE AND DESTROYED ONE 
AT OH FIVE FOUR SEVEN THIS SAME NATO FIGHTER FIRED ANOTHER MISSILE AND DESTROYED THE SECOND AIRCRAFT 
AT OH FIVE FOUR EIGHT THE SAME NATO FIGHTER THE FLIGHT LEAD OF THE TWO THAT HAD BEEN UP FROM THE AREA OF MOSTAR FIRED ANOTHER MISSILE AND DESTROYED A THIRD AIRCRAFT 
AT THIS TIME TWO OTHER NATO FIGHTERS THAT WERE OPERATING IN THE VICINITY WERE IN BY THE NATO AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT 
AT OH FIVE FIVE OH AGAIN GREENWICH MEAN TIME THE LEADER OF THE SECOND NATO FLIGHT FIRED A MISSILE AND DOWNED THE FOURTH 
AT OH FIVE FIVE NINE THE TWO REMAINING EXITED THE AIRSPACE OVER BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA AND WE DID NOT PURSUE THEM 
WE HAVE A SHORT TAPE FROM THE AIRCRAFT WHICH DOWNED THE FIRST THREE OF FOUR 
THE FIRST TWO MISSILE FIRINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE DON'T SHOW THE IMPACTS WITH THE TARGET AIRCRAFT AS THE PILOT WAS SHIFTING FROM THE TARGET THAT HE ENGAGED TO THE NEXT TARGET HE WAS GOING TO ENGAGE 
HIS FINAL SHOT THE THIRD ONE DOES SHOW AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK VERY CLOSELY AND GENERAL WILL POINT IT OUT TO YOU BUT IT DOES SHOW THE THAT COMES FROM THE EXPLOSION 
COULD YOU TURN THAT OFF FOR ONE MINUTE 
OKAY 
TURN IT OFF FOR A MINUTE 
JIM 
THAT'S GREAT 
THANK YOU 
OKAY SO THE FINAL ONE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE EXPLOSION 
I WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING THAT OUR NATO PILOTS HAVE BEEN ENFORCING THE NO FLY ZONE SINCE APRIL OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND THEY'VE CARRIED OUT THEIR MISSION TODAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND IN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH OUR ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES 
WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE THE FINAL SUCH INCIDENT IN A TRAGIC WAR 
NATO WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE NO FLY RESOLUTION AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN OTHER MISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS FORCES WHO ARE WORKING TO REACH AN END TO THE VIOLENCE IN THIS TROUBLED AREA 
SO NOW FOR THE SECOND TIME IF YOU'D PLEASE START THE TAPE AND THEN AFTER YOU SEE THIS WE'LL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS 
AS THE ADMIRAL SAID THIS IS THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT 
THIS HAPPENS TO BE A MISSILE FIRING OF THE ADVANCED MEDIUM RANGE AIR TO AIR MISSILE 
YOU SEE A LOT OF ON THE AIRCRAFT HEAD UP DISPLAY 
THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE AIR SPEED WHICH IS ABOUT ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED KNOTS 
THE MISSILE JUST FIRED 
AND YOU CAN'T TELL TOO MUCH OF IT COMING OFF OF THE RAIL HERE 
O. K. THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE SECOND ONE AND AS THE ADMIRAL ALSO SAID YOU CAN'T SEE THE IMPACT POINT 
THIS HAPPENS TO BE AN A NINE HEAT SEEKING MISSILE INFRARED MISSILE 
AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THE THIRD ON RIGHT THERE 
THERE IT WAS RIGHT THERE 
AS THE ADMIRAL SAID YOU CAN'T SEE IT VERY CLOSELY 
THOSE TAPES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL OF THAT TOOK PLACE VERY QUICKLY FOR THE PILOT 
AND AS HE WAS SHOOTING AT ONE TARGET HE CAME OFF THAT WENT TO THE OTHER TARGET AND SO HIS GOAL WAS NOT TO PRODUCE GOOD PICTURES BUT TO EXECUTE HIS MISSION AND GET HOME SAFELY WHICH HE DID VERY WELL 
ALL RIGHT 
WELL GENERAL AND GENERAL AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AND CAPTAIN MITCHELL WILL POINT OUT WHO THE QUESTIONER WILL BE 
O. K. 
ADMIRAL JOHN FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
HELLO JOHN 
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY OF THESE PLANES HAVE BEEN EVER SIGHTED OVER THE RESTRICTED AREA 
YES 
HAVE BEEN ENGAGED 
WE HAD SOME REPORTS A VERY SHORT FLIGHTS 
ABOUT EVERY MONTH OR SO THE AIRFIELD AT BANJA LUKA USUALLY HAS SOME ON IT AND ABOUT EVERY MONTH OR SO FOR A LONG TIME THEY WOULD TAKE THE OFF THE AIRFIELD AND THEY WOULD TAKE AIRPLANES OUT THERE AND RUN THEM UP AND DOWN TO DO MAINTENANCE BUT NOT FLY THEM 
WE DID HAVE A REPORT OR TWO LAST YEAR THAT THEY HAD DONE VERY SHORT FLIGHTS BUT WE DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THOSE AND THEY WERE NEVER CONFIRMED 
BUT THIS IS CLEARLY THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE SEEN FIXED WING AIRCRAFT FLYING OVER BOSNIA SINCE THE NO FLY ZONE HAS BEEN ENFORCED SINCE APRIL OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
NEXT QUESTION 
RIGHT HERE 
ADMIRAL JOHN MOODY FROM TIME MAGAZINE 
TOM 
YOU MENTIONED THE BOMBING THE APPARENT BOMBING MANEUVER WHICH THE PLANES UNDERTOOK 
IT'S SOMEWHAT HYPOTHETICAL BUT HAD THE PILOT NOT SEEN THESE SUPPOSED BOMBING MANEUVERS WOULD HE PROBABLY HAVE GOTTEN THE AUTHORIZATION TO ENGAGE NONETHELESS 
HE WOULD HAVE ENGAGED NONETHELESS 
THESE WERE ATTACK AIRCRAFT VIOLATING THE NO FLY ZONE AND HE WOULD HAVE ENGAGED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT OBEYING THE WARNINGS AND THEY WERE NOT LEAVING 
AND THEN THEIR ACTIONS CLEARLY SHOWED THEY WEREN'T DOING THAT 
BUT HE WOULD HAVE ENGAGED THEM IN ANY EVENT 
O. K. 
BACK HERE 
ADMIRAL FRYE B. B. C. 
I HAVE TWO SHORT QUESTIONS 
THE FIRST ONE IS JUST A CONFIRMATION 
IS THIS WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE NO FLY ZONE HAD BEEN VIOLATED SINCE THE ENFORCEMENT IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR 
THERE HAVE BEEN HELICOPTER VIOLATIONS AND WE HAVE DEALT WITH THOSE IN THE APPROVED WAY 
I WON'T GO INTO OUR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT 
WE'VE TALKED TO THE WARRING FACTIONS ABOUT THOSE 
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN FIXED WING VIOLATIONS CLEARLY OFFENSIVE AIRCRAFT BEING USED HERE 
AND WE REACTED EXACTLY AS WE TOLD THEM THAT WE WOULD 
HAD SUCH A FIXED WING VIOLATION TAKEN PLACE LET'S SAY FOUR MONTHS AGO WOULD YOU HAVE SHOT DOWN THE PLANES AS WELL 
YES 
RIGHT HERE 
FRANCE PRESS 
CAN YOU TELL US THE NUMBER OF HELICOPTER VIOLATIONS AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS PLANES YOU'VE SHOT DOWN 
ARE THEY BOSNIAN SERBS OR SERBS 
RIGHT NOW I CANNOT TELL YOU WHO OWNED THESE AIRCRAFT 
THERE IS CERTAINLY A FEELING BUT IT'S ONLY A FEELING 
WE PICKED THE TRACK UP NEAR BANJA LUKA AND THEN WE THE AIRCRAFT TO IT 
SO ONE WOULD CONCLUDE FROM THAT THAT THEY MIGHT BE BOSNIAN SERBS 
BUT WE DIDN'T SEE THE AIRCRAFT CLOSE ENOUGH TO DO THAT 
WE SAW THE AIRCRAFT DOING SOMETHING IN VIOLATION AND SO WE ACTED AS WE SAID WE WOULD 
SOME LOCAL CABLE OPERATORS WILL BE CUTTING AWAY FOR A COMMERCIAL MESSAGE AT THIS TIME 
C. N. N.'S LIVE COVERAGE OF ADMIRAL MIKE NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT THE AERIAL DOG FIGHT OVER BOSNIA TODAY CONTINUES 
NO I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER BUT IT IS IN THE HUNDREDS 
BUT THEY ARE ALL HELICOPTERS AND THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FERRYING PEOPLE IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES DOING SOME 
AND WE'VE HAD REPORTS OF OTHER THINGS BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY 
THE SERB PILOTS ARE SAFE AFTER THE SHOOTING AFTER THE FIGHTING 
I'M SORRY 
COULD YOU REPEAT THAT 
I LIKE TO KNOW THE SITUATION ABOUT THE ENEMY THE PILOTS THE SERB PILOTS AFTER THE FIGHTING 
WE DID NOT SEE ANY PILOTS EJECT OR ANY CHUTES IN THE AREA 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT 
IT MEANS THAT OUR PILOTS DID NOT SEE IT 
YES HI 
SUE FROM STARS AND STRIPES 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT WE STAND NOW 
I MEAN AFTER THE ULTIMATUM CAME AND WENT AND NOTHING HAPPENED AND THEN JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER WE STARTED WITH SEEING THESE VIOLATIONS WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S SAYING NOW 
WELL I THINK THESE ARE REALLY TWO DIFFERENT THINGS 
THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IN BOSNIA HERCEGOVINA BY THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTION FORCE THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IN COORDINATION WITH THEM 
FOR VIEWERS US FOLLOWING A LOCAL COMMERCIAL BREAK C. N. N. IS BRINGING YOU LIVE COVERAGE OF A NEWS CONFERENCE FROM NAPLES BY ADMIRAL MIKE BOORDA COMMANDER OF NATO SOUTHERN FORCES ON TODAY'S SHOOT DOWN OF FOUR APPARENTLY BOSNIAN SERB PLANES OVER BOSNIA 
WE REMIND YOU THAT FOR A GENERAL UPDATE OF THE DAY'S NEWS YOU CAN TUNE TO HEADLINE NEWS 
AND WE RETURN TO OUR LIVE COVERAGE 
NOT TO VIOLATE AGAIN 
THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE WAY TO TAKE THIS 
MR. FROM IL WOULD LIKE TO ASK THIS MORNING IN SARAJEVO THE SERBS ATTACKED WITH TANKS THAT HAD BEEN KEPT HIDDEN FROM THE UNITED NATIONS A VIOLATION OF THE ULTIMATUM 
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO 
NO THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE 
THE SERBS DID NOT ATTACK WITH TANKS IN SARAJEVO TODAY OR YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE THAT 
THERE WAS SOME TANK MOVEMENT AND GENERAL ROSE DID A GOOD JOB OF TAKING CONTROL OF THAT AND TAKING CONTROL OF THE TANKS JUST AS HE IS SUPPOSED TO DO 
THERE HAS BEEN NO FIRING BY SERB TANKS IN SARAJEVO TODAY THAT I KNOW OF AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN ANY 
PAUL HANSON REUTERS ADMIRAL 
I HAVE TWO BRIEF QUESTIONS 
THE FIRST IS CAN YOU TELL US WHETHER THE U. S. S. SARATOGA HAS STOPPED ITS PORT CALL AS A RESULT OF THIS OPERATION 
AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD BE YOUR MESSAGE TO ANY OF THE WARRING FACTIONS IF THEY WERE TO CONSIDER A RESPONSE TO THE DOWNING OF THESE FOUR PLANES TOWARDS U. N. PEACEKEEPERS ON THE GROUND 
WELL LET ME SAY FIRST ABOUT SARATOGA THAT SHE'S BEEN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN FOR A WHILE AND WE WANTED TO GET HER IN PORT FOR ABOUT FOUR DAYS 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT THREE DAYS 
AND SHE WILL GET UNDERWAY TO GIVE US SOME MORE CAPABILITY 
HOWEVER I FEEL WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPABILITY RIGHT NOW 
IT JUST SEEMED A PRUDENT THING TO DO 
AND SO SHORTLY SHE WILL BE UNDERWAY 
WITH RESPECT TO WHAT MESSAGE WOULD I SEND TO THE WARRING FACTIONS I THINK WE SENT THAT MESSAGE A LONG TIME AGO 
VIOLATIONS OF THE NO FLY ZONE LIKE WE SAW TODAY WILL SIMPLY NOT BE TOLERATED 
AND IF WE CAN ENGAGE WE WILL ENGAGE 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID 
BRIAN MURPHY FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ARE THERE PLANS TO SEND GROUND FORCES INTO THE AREA WHERE THE PLANES WERE SHOT DOWN TO TRY TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHO WAS FLYING THEM 
THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTION FORCE IS IN CHARGE ON THE GROUND AND EVEN OUR AIR OPERATIONS ARE FULLY COORDINATED WITH THEM 
I TALKED TO GENERAL THIS MORNING ON THIS ISSUE 
AND THEY WILL DO AS BEST THEY CAN 
THEY WILL DO THE WORK HERE TO VERIFY THE THINGS I'VE TOLD YOU 
THEY DO NOT HAVE TOTAL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY 
MR. FROM WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK IF COUNTER AIR MISSILES WERE SENT AGAINST NATO PLANES FROM SERBIAN TERRITORY OR IF NATO PLANES WERE ATTACKED BY SERBIAN PLANES WOULD NATO CONSIDER SERBIAN TERRITORY THEN AS AN OBJECTIVE TO BE ATTACKED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U. N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN 
ANY AIRCRAFT THAT FLY IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA THAT ARE UNAUTHORIZED AND IGNORE THE WARNINGS ARE IN VIOLATION AND WE WILL FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES 
BEYOND THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPROPER FOR ME TO COMMENT ABOUT WHAT NATO OR THE UNITED NATIONS MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT DO 
CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE HEAVY WEAPONS AROUND SARAJEVO 
ARE THEY ALL UNDER U. N. CONTROL 
THERE ARE NO WEAPONS THAT WE KNOW OF THAT ARE NOT IN CONTROL EITHER TURNED IN OR OUT OF THE AREA AROUND SARAJEVO 
THERE ARE SOME WEAPONS THAT GENERAL ROSE IS MOVING AND GETTING EVEN 
CONTROL OF BUT I HAVE TALKED TO THEM AND THEY BELIEVE THAT PROCESS IS GOING VERY WELL 
WE ARE PROVIDING THEM WITH AIR SUPPORT AND WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING THEM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF AIRBORNE RECONNAISSANCE TO HELP THEM SOLIDIFY AND CONSOLIDATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THE GROUND 
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS 
SOMETIMES THE REPORTERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SEEING BECAUSE IT'S A WEAPON THAT IS DISABLED PERHAPS OR A WEAPON HE DOES HAVE UNDER CONTROL 
AND OF COURSE THE FACTIONS THEMSELVES PUT OUT VARIOUS REPORTS FOR THEIR OWN REASONS 
BUT I'VE TALKED TO HIM 
I'VE TALKED TO GENERAL AND MR. AKASHI AND I THINK IT'S GOING VERY WELL THERE 
ADMIRAL TWO BRIEF QUESTIONS 
ONE WHO GAVE THE ACTUAL AUTHORIZATION FOR FIRING IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE 
AND SECONDLY DO WE KNOW WHICH GROUPS HAVE AIRCRAFT OF THIS TYPE AT THEIR DISPOSAL WHETHER ONLY THE SERBS OR SERBS AND CROATIANS OR WHO MIGHT HAVE AIRCRAFT OF THIS TYPE AT THEIR DISPOSAL 
I'LL TALK ABOUT THE FIRST PART 
AND BECAUSE GENERAL CAME I'LL LET HIM TALK ABOUT THE SECOND PART 
BUT LET ME SAY THAT OUR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT ARE NOT SOMETHING I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE BUT WE HAVE AUTHORIZED COMMANDERS WITHIN THE NATO FORCE 
WE HAVE VERY SIMPLE TO USE AND WELL THOUGHT OUT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND THEY WERE FOLLOWED PRECISELY TODAY 
ABOUT THE KINDS OF AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA I'LL TURN THAT OVER TO GENERAL 
THE AIRCRAFT THE IS LOCATED HERE AT BANJA LUKA 
THERE ARE TEN OF THEM 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER AIRFIELD OVER HERE IN THE KRAJINA THAT HAS SOME OF THESE AIRCRAFT LOCATED THERE 
THERE ARE OTHERS HERE IN SERBIA SO THOSE ARE THE ENTITIES THAT HAVE THESE AIRCRAFT 
SO ONLY THE SERB SIDE HAS INAUDIBLE 
YES 
ADMIRAL IT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT ANOTHER MILITARY PERSON IS THINKING BUT IN YOUR ESTIMATION WAS THE INTRUSION OF AIR SPACE A TEST OF NATO RESOLVE 
I DON'T KNOW 
IF IT WAS A TEST I THINK WE PASSED A QUIZ 
I HOPE THAT THERE IS ALSO A LESSON LEARNED 
WHEN YOU TAKE A TEST YOU GET A CRITIQUE AT THE END 
AND THE CRITIQUE HERE IS THAT YOU REALLY OUGHT NOT TO VIOLATE THE NO FLY ZONE 
ADMIRAL JUST TO CLARIFY WERE YOUR PLANES ENGAGED IN ANY WAY EITHER FROM THE GROUND OR BY THE 
THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THEIR AIRCRAFT WERE TRYING TO SHOOT DOWN OUR AIRCRAFT NO 
THAT'S THE LAST QUESTION 
OKAY 
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR COMING 
AND I KNOW THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF THERE ARE A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE FROM THE ITALIAN MEDIA AND I ASKED GENERAL IF HE WOULD STAY AND WITH YOU IN ITALIAN PERHAPS ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO FACILITATE YOU USING THAT INFORMATION THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING
