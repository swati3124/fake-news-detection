CONTINUING NOW OUR EXPANDED COVERAGE OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL LAWYER BASHING 
WE'RE JOINED BY TWO ATTORNEYS WITH VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES 
IN SAN FRANCISCO HARVEY PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR 
YOU HEARD HIM JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO 
AND IN CHICAGO JOSEPH MORRIS PRESIDENT OF THE LINCOLN LEGAL FOUNDATION A FREE MARKET ORIENTED PUBLIC INTEREST LAW CENTER 
GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO YOU BOTH 
MR. TO YOU FIRST WHAT WOULD MAKING LAWYER BASHING A HATE CRIME ACCOMPLISH 
WELL THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO STOP THE LAWYER BASHING 
THAT'S THE FIRST THING 
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT LAWYER BASHING HAS GONE TOO FAR IS GOING TOO FAR 
MAKING IT A CRIME IS ONLY ONE PART OF IT 
OKAY LET ME JUMP IN NOW 
THAT MAY BE NOT BE THE SOLUTION 
WHAT IS LAWYER BASHING 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
IS IT A JOKE ON THE JAY LENO SHOW 
IS IT A SPEECH BY PRESIDENT BUSH AT THE CONVENTION 
JUST EXACTLY WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
LAWYER BASHING IN MY OPINION IS NOT SIMPLY JOKES NOT SIMPLY THE JAY LENO SHOW OR MARK TWAIN OR GOOD THOUGHTFUL POLITICAL HUMOR 
IT IS TAKING AN ENTIRE GROUP AND PAINTING THEM WITH ONE BROAD BRUSH 
I TOOK TALK SHOWS TODAY WHERE PEOPLE SAID THAT ALL LAWYERS ARE AND 
WELL THEY CAN'T ALL BE THAT WAY AND THAT'S WHAT HATE CRIMES AND HATE SPEECH IS LIKE 
IT'S PAINTING ALL PEOPLE WITH ONE BRUSH EVEN THOUGH THERE'S VARIATIONS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD AND THERE'S GOOD LAWYERS THERE'S BAD LAWYERS THERE'S LAWYERS OF ALL COLORS AND ALL 
AND YET SOMEBODY TAKES IT AND GOES BANG 
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME 
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME 
THEY'RE ALL TERRIBLE 
THAT'S HATE CRIME 
JOSEPH MORRIS WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS 
WELL I WISH IT WERE THE CASE THAT LAWYERS WERE UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED 
IN A WAY THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WERE 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE GOT TO EARN THAT RESPECT 
AND UNFORTUNATELY IN RECENT YEARS IF TRUTH BE TOLD THIS HAS BECOME AN EXCESSIVELY SOCIETY IN PART BECAUSE LAWYERS HAVE NOT REALLY HAD A SENSE OF THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT THE LAW CAN ACCOMPLISH 
WE HAVE INTRUDED LAW INTO AREAS WHERE LAW SIMPLY CAN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS 
LAW CANNOT BE CALLED ON TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE THAT IN THE HEAT OF EMOTION IN THE HEAT OF ANGER PEOPLE WILL SEE LAWYERS WHO SOMETIMES SEEM TO BE HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS THE PRIESTS THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD OF SOME KIND OF SYSTEM PURPORTS TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM AND RELIEVE EVERYBODY OF EVERY KIND OF FEAR OR RESPONSIBILITY AS SOMEHOW FALLING DOWN ON THE JOB 
IF LAWYERS HAVE A SENSE PROPORTION I THINK WE CAN WEATHER THIS 
JOE ISN'T THAT 
TO BUILD A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT COMMANDS RESPECT 
GO AHEAD MR. 
IF THE LEGAL SYSTEM COMMANDS RESPECT 
LET'S GET MR. IN HERE 
LAWYERS WILL COMMAND RESPECT 
JOE THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WHICH IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT LAWYERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP THAT THEY DON'T OPERATE IN FEAR THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEM IF THEY TAKE RISKS 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT LAWYERS WILL BE DISCOURAGED LAWYERS WHO TAKE THE UNPOPULAR CAUSES THE LAWYERS THAT TAKE THE FREE CASES AND THOSE ARE THE LAWYERS THAT ARE MOST EFFECTED BY THIS SLAP DASH BIGOTRY AGAINST ALL LAWYERS AS BEING SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM THEY'RE ALL JADED FOR MONEY THEY'RE ALL FAT TAX LAWYERS THEY'RE ALL RICH 
MR. WE ABOVE ALL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH OUR WORDS 
WE RUN A RISK HERE OF LAW OF HATE CRIMES 
THIS ISN'T HATE AGAINST LAWYERS 
THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF HATE THAT EXISTS WHEN WE'RE TALKING OF BIGOTRY IN TERMS OF RACE OR RELIGION OR NATIONAL ORIGIN 
WE SHOULD BE GETTING A MESSAGE HERE 
THE MESSAGE HERE IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS AND WE NEED TO LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THAT 
LET ME JUMP IN HERE GENTLEMEN 
I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION AND MR. I DIRECT IT TO YOU FIRST 
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE TARGETED AGAINST LAWYERS AND THAT THERE IS TRULY DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OR IT IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT YOU CALL LAWYER BASHING 
I BELIEVE THERE'S AN INCREASE IN LAWYER BASHING 
I CAN'T SAY THERE'S AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE ALTHOUGH WE'VE SEEN IT AND IT'S ONLY ANECDOTAL AT THIS POINT BUT THERE'S CLEARLY AN INCREASE IN AGGRESSION 
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN THE NINETIES WITH THE RECESSION GOING ON WITH PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME FOR THEIR PROBLEMS THEY'RE GOING TO TURN TO THE MOST VISIBLE TARGET THAT'S AROUND RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S LAWYERS 
AND THE MORE WE ALLOW IT TO BECOME LAWYERS THE MORE DANGEROUS IT BECOMES 
MR. MORRIS WHY NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN 
WELL LAWYERS ABOVE ALL PEOPLE SHOULD NOT OVERREACT TO A SITUATION LIKE THIS AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE SEEN TO BE ENGAGING IN SPECIAL PLEADING 
IF THERE IS VIOLENCE AGAINST LAWYERS OR ANYONE ELSE VIOLENCE SHOULD BE MET AND BE MET HARD 
BUT THE LORD KNOWS WE SHOULD NOT BE CARVING OUT LAWS SPECIALLY PROTECTING LAWYERS AS AGAINST ANYONE ELSE 
THIS IS TERRIBLE OVERREACTION AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE LAWYERS CALLING ON RESTRICTIONS ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT OR THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE SAYING ABOUT LAWYERS IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT OURSELVES PROFESSIONALLY 
MR. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT THEN 
I'M NOT GOING TO DO A THING ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
I HOPE THAT JAY LENO CONTINUES WITH HIS JOKES 
I HOPE THAT EVERYONE CONTINUES WITH THEIR FREE SPEECH BUT THERE'S A POINT AT WHICH IT CROSSES THE BOUNDARIES AND AGGRESSION ON PEOPLE 
THEY ARE ON THE MARGIN 
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE MARGINS WHO MIGHT COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST ATTORNEYS AS A WAY OF WHAT THEY THINK IS THEIR PROBLEM WITH LIFE OR THEIR PROBLEM WITH SOCIETY 
THAT'S THE DANGER 
AND I THINK FOR SO LONG WE HAVE TRIED TO POLISH THE IMAGE OF LAWYERS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IMPROVING THE LEGAL SYSTEM WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE CAN HELP OURSELVES AND WE'VE NEVER DONE A THING TO SAY STOP IT 
WILL YOU STOP THE LAWYER BASHING 
IT'S TRUE WE'VE GOT SOME BAD APPLES BUT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO ACCUSE AN ENTIRE PROFESSION OF BEING SOME OF THE THINGS 
I'VE GOTTEN CALLS TODAY THAT I CAN'T EVEN REPEAT THEY'RE SO HORRIBLE 
THREATENING CALLS 
SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF ANGER 
YES THREATENING CALLS 
ACTUAL THREATS 
WELL THERE'S NO EXCUSE 
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR VIOLENCE AND THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE 
THAT SHOULD NEVER BE JUSTIFIED 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE DO OURSELVES LET ALONE OUR COUNTRY A FAVOR WHEN WE SAY THAT THE PROBLEM HERE IS OTHER PEOPLE'S SPEECH 
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO OURSELVES 
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE WAY WE CONDUCT OUR PROFESSION 
IF THE LEGAL PROFESSION MET PEOPLE'S NEEDS IF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM WAS CLEARLY PERCEIVED BY OUR FELLOW CITIZENS TO ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW WE WOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM 
LET'S LOOK TO THE CAUSES NOT TO THE SYMPTOM 
MR. WHAT TRIGGERED IN YOUR MIND THE RESPONSE THAT YOU MADE TODAY THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU MADE TODAY 
WAS IT IN FACT THIS ATTACK IN SAN FRANCISCO 
IT WAS TWO THINGS 
ONE FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR AS PRESIDENT OF THE STATE BAR I'VE BEEN TRYING TO IMPROVE THE LAWYERS' IMAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
IT'S TOUGH 
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T LIKE LAWYERS 
SECONDLY WE HAD THE INCIDENT IN SAN FRANCISCO A HORRIBLE INCIDENT AND I DON'T WANT TO DOWNGRADE THAT 
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED THERE 
AND THIRD IS THAT THE WEEKEND I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE AT THE STATE BAR COULD DO ABOUT THIS AND LAWYERS COULD DO SOMEBODY CALLED ME WITH OF ALL THINGS A LAWYER ABOUT A JOKE ABOUT THE KILLING OF THE LAWYERS 
AND I JUST SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE 
WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT BACK 
AND IT'S TRUE I DON'T WANT TO RESTRICT PEOPLE'S FIRST SPEECH 
I WANT TO RAISE THE PUBLIC DEBATE ON THIS AND GET PEOPLE OFF THE POINT WHERE THEY STOP PAINTING ALL LAWYERS WITH ONE BROAD BRUSH AND STOP BEING SO CYNICAL ABOUT OUR LEGAL SYSTEM 
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE CAN DO THAT IS GOOD AND WE JUST HAVE TO START THE DEBATE AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND STOP THIS SNIPING THAT'S GOING ON 
MR. MORRIS LAST WORD TO YOU IN ABOUT THE THIRTY SECONDS REMAINING 
DO YOU FEEL THAT BECAUSE OF THE POSITION THAT LAWYERS PUT THEMSELVES IN IN BETWEEN DISPUTES IN THE MIDDLE THAT THEY ARE THAT YOU ARE MORE A TARGET SOMEHOW AND THAT SOME SPECIAL STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN 
WELL IN A WAY THAT'S TRUE 
THAT'S THE GLORY OF OUR SYSTEM 
WE ARE A SYSTEM OF LAWS 
OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE A CIVIL AND PACIFIC WAY OF RESOLVING DISPUTES AND IT IS THE JOB OF LAWYERS TO STEP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT BUT LAWYERS MUST NOT 
LAWYERS MUST NOT SPECIALLY PLEAD 
OUR JOB AS WHAT WE'D LIKE TO THINK OF AS A LEARNED PROFESSION IS TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM LIMITS ITSELF TO THOSE PROBLEMS IT CAN REALLY TACKLE 
FRANK I 
IT'S WHEN WE OVERSTEP THOSE BOUNDS THAT WE GET OURSELVES 
FRANK I JUST WANT TO SAY 
INTO TROUBLE 
AND CALLING ON OTHER PEOPLE TO CURTAIL THEIR SPEECH DOESN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM 
FRANK THIS IS NO SPECIAL PLEA 
WE'VE GO ALL KINDS OF LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THAT PROHIBIT VIOLENCE AND VIOLENT ACTS AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST VARIOUS GROUPS AND PROFESSIONS 
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN PUTTING US AT EQUAL 
OKAY GENTLEMEN 
WITH ANY OTHER PROFESSION 
HARVEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR VIEWS 
THANK YOU 
AND JOSEPH MORRIS WE APPRECIATE YOURS AS WELL
