PERU'S MAOIST GUERRILLAS DID NOT TAKE LONG TO LAUNCH A TERRORIST RESPONSE TO THE CAPTURE OF THEIR LEADER 
SUSPECTED SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS ARE BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A CAR BOMB EXPLOSION JUST OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL TODAY 
AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE WERE INJURED AND SEVERAL CARS DESTROYED 
AUTHORITIES ALSO BLAME THE REBEL GROUP OF THE KILLING OF A POLICEMAN TODAY IN LIMA 
THE VIOLENCE COMES ONE DAY AFTER PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES NABBED THE MAN PRESIDENT ALBERTO ONCE DESCRIBED AS A GENIUS 
THE FOUNDER OF THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLA MOVEMENT WAS ARRESTED LATE SATURDAY NIGHT IN A LIMA SUBURB 
THE ARREST IS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT AUTHORITIES ARE WARNING THE PEOPLE OF PERU TO EXPECT MORE TERRORIST ATTACKS 
IS EXPECTED TO BE TRIED FOR TREASON AND FACES A LIFE SENTENCE WITHOUT PARDON 
C. N. N.'S LUCIA NEWMAN IS IN LIMA 
SHE JOINS US NOW ON THE PHONE WITH THE LATEST ON THE STORY 
LUCIA WILL ARREST UNDERMINE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLAS 
YES JIM IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS WELL IT'S ALMOST SURE THAT THIS IS A TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOW TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SHINING PATH 
HOWEVER THE ORGANIZATION IS VERY HIGHLY ORGANIZED AND AS A MAOIST GROUP IT'S UNDOUBTEDLY HAD A CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR THIS 
EXPERTS SAY THAT THEY ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO REORGANIZE AND THERE'S FEAR THAT ONCE THEY HAVE ORGANIZED THEY WILL LAUNCH A MAJOR OFFENSIVE TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE STILL A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
JIM 
WELL LUCIA THERE IS THEN A FEAR THAT ARREST WILL SPARK SOME KIND OF RETALIATION 
COULD IT SPARK AN ALL OUT WAR SIMILAR TO THE DEADLY DRUG WARS IN COLUMBIA 
JIM THERE'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERU AND COLUMBIA 
THIS COUNTRY IS ALREADY IN AN ALL OUT WAR 
I THINK THE GENERAL FEELING HERE IS THAT THINGS COULD NOT GET REALLY MUCH WORSE THAN THEY WERE 
SINCE PRESIDENT SHUT DOWN CONGRESS IN APRIL AND DECLARED HIS ONE MAN RULE TERRORIST ATTACKS BY THE SHINING PATH HAVE INTENSIFIED 
THERE'VE BEEN CAR BOMBINGS AND MANY MORE DEATHS THAN THERE WERE BEFORE THAT 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO STICK IT OUT 
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE ARREST OF HAD TO HAPPEN AND THAT THE BLOW PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND PERHAPS IN AN ORGANIZATIONAL WAY AS WELL TO THE SHINING PATH GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT 
LUCIA HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THE TERRORISTS TO REGROUP AND PERHAPS ESCALATE THESE ATTACKS 
I DON'T I THINK THEY'VE ALREADY ARE REGROUPING 
NOBODY CAN SAY FOR SURE 
IT'S A VERY SECRETIVE MOVEMENT 
THAT'S WHAT'S MADE THEM SO SUCCESSFUL 
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS IN ARMS BUT THEY HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS AROUND THE CAPITAL AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
JUST HOW WELL ORGANIZED THEY ARE IS SOMETHING WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE IN THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND WEEKS 
JIM 
THANK YOU LUCIA
