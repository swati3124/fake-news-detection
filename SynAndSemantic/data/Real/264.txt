MANY ARE BLAMING PRESIDENT YELTSIN AND HIS FELLOW REFORMERS FOR THE FAR RIGHT SURGE 
THEY SAY DEMOCRATIC FORCES CAMPAIGNED WITHOUT GUSTO WITHOUT UNITY 
BUT C. N. N.'S EILEEN O'CONNOR REPORTS THIS COULD BE THEIR WAKE UP CALL 
THIS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST WORRYING SCENES FOR BORIS YELTSIN RUSSIAN SOLDIERS VOTING AS IT TURNED OUT IN LARGE PART FOR NATIONALIST VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY AND NO WONDER 
FROM THIS METAL IN THE SAME FACTORY WE CAN PRODUCE SUBMARINE 
THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS DOLLARS IS ALL IT TAKES 
DEFENSE DEPENDS AS IF MANY PROFIT FROM OUR MILITARY INDUSTRY AND ITS THIS PROFIT IT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR ECONOMY 
THAT PROFIT ZHIRINOVSKY PROMISES HE WILL USE FOR BETTER PAY AND BETTER HOUSING OF THE MILITARY AND OF THE PEOPLE MUSIC TO THEIR EARS WORDS PERHAPS DISMISSED BY THE YELTSIN GOVERNMENT 
WE UNDERESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF SUCH PROPAGANDA IN A SOCIETY WHICH OF COURSE WANTS TO HEAR SWEET LIES NOT BORING UNPLEASANT TRUTH 
BUT FOR ALL THE VOTES THAT ARE PUTTING ZHIRINOVSKY AND HIS FOLLOWERS INTO PARLIAMENT HOW MUCH POWER HAVE THEY REALLY GAINED 
FOR THE PANIC SURROUNDING ZHIRINOVSKY COULD FORCE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES TO FORGET THEIR DIFFERENCES AND FORGE AN ALLIANCE AGAINST HIM 
TO A LARGE EXTENT VICTORY OF ZHIRINOVSKY IN MANY AREAS IS DUE TO WEAKNESS OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES 
MY FEELING VERY DIFFICULT AND HARD POLITICAL AND A LOT OF POLITICAL CONFLICT 
THAT CONFLICT MAY AGAIN SERVE BORIS YELTSIN ALLOWING HIM TO CIRCUMVENT THIS NEW PARLIAMENT WITH STRONGER EXECUTIVE POWERS GIVEN HIM BY THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND JUSTIFY IT IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY 
BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT PRESIDENT YELTSIN WILL USE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS AND HE HAS SERVED IN TWO YEARS POPULAR MANDATE TO STOP ANY ATTEMPT TO THROW THIS COUNTRY WHICH SUFFERED SO MUCH FROM COMMUNISM TO ANOTHER FASCIST TYPE OF ORDEAL 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE POLITICAL PEACE THAT SO MANY VOTERS SAID THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR IS AS REMOTE AS EVER
