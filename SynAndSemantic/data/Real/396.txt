CONTINUING TO LOOK NOW AT THIS LATE IN THE DAY WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT U. S. TROOPS WILL GO INTO RWANDA THIS WEEKEND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE REFUGEES THERE 
C. N. N.'S SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WOLF BLITZER IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
WOLF TELL US WHAT EXACTLY THESE TWO HUNDRED TROOPS ARE GOING TO BE DOING IN KIGALI THE RWANDAN CAPITAL 
JUDY THE TROOPS WILL STRICTLY BE GOING THERE TO OPEN UP THE AIRPORT 
UNTIL NOW THERE HAVE BEEN TWO AIRFIELDS THAT THE U. S. OPERATION THE RELIEF OPERATION HAS BEEN USING 
ONE IN GOMA ZAIRE AND THE OTHER ONE IN UGANDA BUT THOSE AIRFIELDS ARE DEEMED NOT GOOD ENOUGH NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE THIS MASSIVE OPERATION 
THE HUMANITY THE DISASTER IS SO ENORMOUS THE U. S. HAS DECIDED THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM IS TO TRY TO OPEN UP THE KIGALI AIRPORT WHICH IS BIGGER AND PRESUMABLY WILL ALLOW MORE SUPPLIES TO COME IN 
THESE TWO HUNDRED U. S. FORCES SOME OF WHOM WILL BE THERE FOR SECURITY REASONS BUT OTHERS ARE TECHNICIANS OTHERS ARE THERE TO TRY TO GET THE RADAR SYSTEM GOING THE AIR BASE IN OPERATION THEY WILL BE THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AIR FIELD IS OPEN OVER THE NEXT WEEK TO TEN DAYS SO THAT GIANT U. S. TRANSPORT PLANES CAN COME IN AND UNLOAD SUPPLIES 
THEY WANT IT OPERATIONAL WOLF DO THEY NOT SO THAT AS MUCH SUPPLIES AS MANY SUPPLIES AS POSSIBLE CAN GET IN THERE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE RETURNING FROM ZAIRE 
THAT'S RIGHT AND IT'S ALSO AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO RWANDAN REFUGEES TO COME BACK HOME IF THEY SEE THAT THERE WILL BE SUPPLIES THERE 
IF THE U. S. IS THERE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IT WILL ENCOURAGE THE REFUGEES TO COME BACK TO THEIR HOMES IN RWANDA 
ALL RIGHT WOLF BLITZER AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO YOU A LITTLE LATER ON THE WORLD TODAY
