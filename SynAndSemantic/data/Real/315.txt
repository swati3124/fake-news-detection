A LITTLE TOWN IN ALABAMA HAS A BIG JUMP ON THE SKY SCRAPER WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISABLED 
C. N. N.'S PAT ETHERIDGE PAYS A VISIT 
IT'S A TOWN BEST KNOWN FOR ITS SUPER SPEEDWAY 
BUT ALABAMA IS ALSO DISTINCT FOR THE MANY IT OFFERS THE DISABLED 
IMAGING A PLACE WHERE STOP LIGHTS TALK 
YOU MAY CROSS THE STREET 
WHERE BLIND CHILDREN ORDER FROM BRAILLE MENUS AT 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL THAT YOU DON'T STAND OUT THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE 
OR WHERE A DEAF MAN FINDS SUCCESS AS A CAR SALESMAN 
I TALK WITH THEM VERY OPENLY 
I LET THEM FEEL THEY ARE THE WINNER AND ARE GOING TO BUY THIS CAR AT A GOOD COST 
IN A COMMUNITY OF JUST NINETEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS LIVE WITH DISABILITIES 
THERE ARE A FEW SMALL TOWNS IN THE SOUTH THAT CAN CLAIM A SECOND LANGUAGE HAS ONE THAT IS UNSPOKEN 
THE SECOND LANGUAGE HERE IS SIGN LANGUAGE 
THE IMPETUS STEMS IN LARGE PART FROM THE ALABAMA INSTITUTE FOR DEAF AND BLIND A SCHOOL FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT TRAINS STUDENTS TO COMPETE IN A REAL WORLD WORKPLACE 
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT HANDICAPPED PEOPLE 
THEY JUST DON'T SEE VERY WELL THEY DON'T HEAR VERY WELL 
THEY HAVE ALL THE ABILITIES THAT ANYBODY ELSE HAVE AND THEY NEED CHANCES TO USE THEIR TALENTS AND BE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY 
FIVE YEAR OLD MICHAEL MYERS IS WELL ON HIS WAY HE'S ALREADY SOLVING MATH EQUATIONS IN BRAILLE 
THE CHILDREN ARE LEARNING SOCIAL SKILLS THAT THEY REALLY NEED YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE TO GROW UP TO BE HEALTHY ADULTS 
LATER IN LIFE OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND 
AT THIS FACTORY WHICH PRODUCES GOODS FOR THE MILITARY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WORK FORCE IS VISUALLY IMPAIRED 
OUR QUALITY IS THE HIGHEST 
WE'RE PROUD OF OUR WHAT OUR PEOPLE DO HERE 
WITH CAREFUL CITY PLANNING THE DISABLED BLEND IN 
IT'S NOT THAT WAY IN ALL TOWNS 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SHY AWAY OR HOLD A PERSON AT ARM'S LENGTH WITH A DISABILITY BUT WE WOULDN'T BE THAT WAY IN AT ALL 
MORE THAN A FEW LOCAL MERCHANTS HAVE STUDIED UP ON SIGN LANGUAGE SO THEY CAN BETTER SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS 
I'M NOT REAL FAST BUT I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THEM 
IT'S A PLACE THAT FOCUSES ON ABILITIES WHERE DISABILITIES GO LARGELY UNNOTICED
