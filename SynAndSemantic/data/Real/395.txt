HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT YOU MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF DOING IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION 
HOW FAR COULD YOU BE PUSHED BEFORE YOU PUSHED BACK 
WELL THE MAN YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET REACHED HIS LIMIT AND THEN ACTED 
HE WAS A DEVOTED FAMILY MAN AND A FORMER POLICEMAN SO THE COMMUNITY WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED FOR ARMED ROBBERY 
WHY WOULD THIS UNLIKELY SUSPECT TURN TO CRIME 
WELL TONIGHT TOM JARRIEL TAKES YOU BEHIND THE SCENES OF THIS BAFFLING INCIDENT 
AND LIKE SO MANY OF THE TRAGIC STORIES WE HEAR ABOUT EVERY DAY THE DEEPER YOU LOOK THE MORE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND 
IT WAS JUST BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK O'CLOCK ON A QUIET FRIDAY NIGHT IN WHITE PLAINS NEW YORK 
LIQUOR SALESMAN WAS CLOSING UP FOR THE NIGHT 
THESE ARE YOUR SECURITY WINDOWS 
YES THEY ARE 
HAD NO IDEA THIS AUGUST EVENING WAS ABOUT TO TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE 
JUST A FEW MILES AWAY IN THIS APARTMENT BUILDING A DESPERATE MAN WAS REACHING HIS BREAKING POINT 
I SAID I HAVE TO GET MONEY 
I HAVE TO GET MONEY 
AT FIRST IT SEEMED LIKE A ROUTINE CASE OF ARMED ROBBERY LIKE ONE OF THOUSANDS THAT OCCUR EACH NIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
I TOOK ONE OF MY GUNS 
I'M GOING TO GO UP TO THE STORE AND I'LL GET SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS 
WHAT MADE THIS ARMED ROBBERY DIFFERENT WAS THE ROBBER HAD BEEN A COP A HIGHLY DECORATED POLICE OFFICER WITH AWARDS AND WHO WAS CROSSING A THRESHOLD IN HIS LIFE 
I STOPPED ON A SIDE STREET 
I PUT ON A STOCKING MASK A RED STOCKING MASK 
HE REACHED IN HIS RIGHTHAND POCKET AND TOOK OUT A GUN 
AND I SAID YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS AND HE SAID YEAH 
I SAID ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW PUT THE MONEY IN THE BAG HAPPEN 
HE SAYS LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR YOU'RE GOING TO BE A DEAD MAN 
STILL HAD THE GUN ON YOU 
YES SIR 
I GOT DOWN HERE ON THE FLOOR AS SUCH 
HE HAD SAID TO ME IF I GOT UP IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES I WAS GOING TO BE A DEAD MAN 
MY BODY JUST SHOOK TERRIBLY 
RIGHT 
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ALL OVER FOR ME 
THE ARREST OF EX POLICE OFFICER ERIC STUNNED THE COMMUNITY 
HOME VIDEOS SHOW AS A DEVOTED FAMILY MAN AND HE HAD COME FROM A FAMILY WHO HAD DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT 
HIS FATHER A POLICE CHIEF HAD SERVED AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTY'S POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION 
HIS GRANDFATHER HAD PROUDLY WALKED A BEAT IN HARLEM FOR TWENTY YEARS 
SO WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES COULD POSSIBLY DRIVE A FORMER COP TO COMMIT ARMED ROBBERY THREATENING A LIFE FOR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS 
IT WAS SOON DISCOVERED THAT FOR THE PAST YEARS ERIC LIFE HAD BEEN A LIVING HELL 
FIRST OFFICER HAD SERIOUSLY INJURED HIS BACK DURING AN ARREST AND HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE POLICE FORCE 
HE WAS A GOOD COP AND WHEN HE HAD TO RETIRE IT IT WAS DEVASTATING 
WIFE LIZ IS A REGISTERED NURSE 
SHE AND ERIC WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER GETTING MARRIED SIX YEARS AGO 
YOU'VE SAID THAT SOME MISFORTUNE SEEMED TO SET IN YOUR LIFE ALMOST FROM THE TIME YOU GOT BACK FROM YOUR HONEYMOON 
WE CALL IT THE CURSE 
WHAT THEY CALL THE CURSE BEGAN WITH THE SUICIDE OF BELOVED FATHER THE NIGHT THEY RETURNED HOME FROM A BLISSFUL HONEYMOON 
HIS OLDER BROTHER AS WELL COMMITTED SUICIDE 
BUT THE BURDEN OF THE CURSE FOR ERIC SEEMED TO HAVE FINALLY BEEN LIFTED AS LIZ GAVE BIRTH TO A LITTLE BABY BOY THEY NAMED CHRISTOPHER 
CHRISTOPHER'S BIRTH WAS THE GREATEST THING THAT COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO ME 
I FELT LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE WAS TURNING AROUND 
BUT WHILE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL THE DOCTORS DIAGNOSED BABY CHRISTOPHER WITH A RARE HEART DISORDER CALLED WOLF PARKINSON WHITE SYNDROME 
HE HAD A HEART CONDITION AND WE ADDRESSED IT PROPERLY BUT AFTER THAT WAS UNDER CONTROL WITH MEDICATION WE BROUGHT HIM HOME 
WHEN HE WAS A YEAR OLD HE STARTED WALKING TO THE DAY 
AND AT TWO YEARS HE WAS HITTING BASEBALLS 
HE WAS VERY VERY ATHLETIC 
BUT LIZ AND ERIC KNEW THAT LITTLE CHRISTOPHER'S CONDITION WAS LIKE A TIME BOMB 
AT ANY MOMENT THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSES OF HIS HEART COULD SHORT CIRCUIT AND CAUSE INSTANT DEATH 
THEY HEARD ABOUT A SPECIALIST IN OKLAHOMA WHO HAD DEVISED A SURGICAL PROCEDURE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM 
ON JULY NINTH NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE FAMILY FLEW TOGETHER TO OKLAHOMA FOR THEIR SON'S OPERATION 
I MADE CHRISTOPHER PROMISE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SURGERY WHEN HE GOT AND HE ASKED ME HE SAID MOMMY PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME' THEN I SAID I PROMISE UNTIL WE GO HOME I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU 
AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE OPERATION 
WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
WE JUST KNOW THAT HIS SOMETHING WENT TERRIBLY AWRY AND HE LOST HIS A LARGE AMOUNT OF HE LOST OXYGEN TO HIS HEART TO HIS BRAIN BECAUSE OF A THROUGH HIS HEART FROM ONE OF THE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO TALK ABOUT 
AND THE MORNING OF THE SURGERY HE SAID I LOVE YOU 
I LOVE YOU MOMMY 
I LOVE YOU MOMMY 
I LOVE YOU MOMMY 
I LOVE YOU 
HE SAID AND HE SAID GOOD BYE 
THAT WAS IT 
AND THAT WAS THE LAST THING I EVER SAID TO HIM WAS I LOVE YOU 
YOU'RE COMING BACK TO ME 
PHYSICALLY TODAY HE'S COMPLETELY 
WE HAVE TO CARE FOR HIM TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM WITH ANYBODY 
HE IS LEGALLY BLIND 
BUT HE DOES HEAR 
YES 
OH HE DEFINITELY DOES HEAR BECAUSE AT TIMES WE DO GET RESPONSES FROM HIM AND WE DO GET SMILES 
AND THOSE LITTLE BITS OF SMILES ARE THE GREATEST GIFTS 
THE SAY DOCTORS ORIGINALLY TOLD THEM CHRISTOPHER WOULD SNAP OUT OF IT AND COME TO THAT IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME 
LIZ AND ERIC SPENT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT BY THEIR SON'S BEDSIDE WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BUT IT NEVER DID 
TODAY CHRISTOPHER LIVES DISABLED FROM THE NECK DOWN AND BRAIN DAMAGED 
TO WHAT EXTENT THE DOCTORS ARE NOT SURE 
WHAT THE SUGGESTED IS THAT WE IN A SENSE COMMIT HIM TO A LONG TERM FACILITY 
IN OTHER WORDS PUT HIM AWAY PLACE HIM 
RIGHT 
WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR ABOUT ONE SECOND AND THEN WE TURNED TO EACH OTHER AND WE SAID THERE'S NO WAY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH ARE WE GOING TO PUT OUR SON AWAY IN ANY HOME NO MATTER WHAT 
WE ARE GOING TO MY WIFE GAVE BIRTH TO HIM 
WE PLAYED WITH HIM 
WE TOOK CARE OF HIM FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS WHEN HE WAS PRIOR TO HIS INJURY 
AND JUST BECAUSE OF HIS INJURY NOT TREATING HIM ANY DIFFERENTLY 
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM THE AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE AND MY WIFE IS ALIVE 
THEY DID THIS IN PART THROUGH A STATE RUN PROGRAM MONITORED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OR DSS 
CASE WORKERS MAKE REGULAR VISITS TO SEE THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE IS MAINTAINED IN THE HOME AND THERE WAS MUCH THAT HAD TO BE DONE FOR LITTLE CHRISTOPHER 
SINCE HE HAS NO MUSCLE CONTROL HE MUST BE FED THROUGH A TUBE IN HIS STOMACH 
HE HAS SEVERE MUSCLE AND TAKES SEVEN TO TEN MEDICATIONS DAILY 
AND HIS HEART PROBLEM WAS NEVER CORRECTED SO HE REMAINS IN CONSTANT DANGER OF HEART FAILURE 
AND THE COST OF THESE MEDICATIONS DOCTORS' VISITS AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN NEVER ENDING 
IT'S BEEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS 
WE HAVE BILLS COMING IN AT US EVERY SINGLE DAY EXCEPT SUNDAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO MAIL 
ERIC DID HAVE A SMALL PENSION AND SOME INSURANCE BUT IT WAS ONLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET TOWARD THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MEDICAL BILLS THAT KEPT ADDING UP 
HOW DID YOU PERSONALLY BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THE PRESSURES THAT WERE BUILDING UP ON YOU 
I WAS RUNNING FROM MY PROBLEMS 
I WOULD SAY THEY'RE OVERWHELMING ME 
RUN DRINK TAKE YOUR PAIN KILLERS GET AWAY FROM IT 
IT WAS JUST LIKE A VOLCANO JUST WAITING TO ERUPT 
THE PRESSURES WERE SUCH THAT COLLECTION AGENCIES CALLING TEN ELEVEN TIMES A DAY 
THE BANK WE GOT OVERDRAFTS BOUNCED CHECKS 
THERE WAS NO MONEY 
WE HAD GOTTEN ALL THE HELP FROM OUR PARENTS THAT WE COULD GET AND THERE WAS THERE WERE NO OTHER WAYS TO GET MONEY 
SHE WAS AFRAID AS I BECAME AFRAID ALSO THAT THAT SOCIAL SERVICES WOULD STEP IN IF WE COULDN'T PAY OUR BILLS AND TAKE CHRISTOPHER FROM US 
TO MAKE ENDS MEET ERIC WENT TO WORK PART TIME IN THE VERY LIQUOR STORE HE WOULD LATER ROB 
AND ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST SIXTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE HE MADE A DESPERATE DECISION 
I DIDN'T NEED A FORTUNE 
I WASN'T LOOKING TO ROB A BANK OR GET A FORTUNE OR YOU KNOW BECOME A MILLIONAIRE 
I JUST WANTED TO PAY SOME BILLS 
YOU WALKED IN THE STORE AND THERE BEHIND THE COUNTER IS YOUR OLD FRIEND 
IS YES NOT THE OWNER OF THE STORE 

YEAH 
AND 
WHO WAS WHO WAS A DEAR FRIEND WHO I AM SO SORRY TO 
WHEN I FOUND OUT IT WAS HIM I WAS TOTALLY DEVASTATED 
I THINK I RELIVED THE WHOLE ROBBERY ALL OVER AGAIN 
I MEAN MY BODY JUST FELL APART DEVASTATED THAT HE WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SOMEONE HE KNEW 
MEANWHILE OUT ON BAIL ERIC GOT THE NAME OF LAWYER JEFFREY ORLANDO 
TOGETHER THEY WORKED ON THE CRIMINAL CASE 
THEIR GOAL WAS TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE D. A. AND THE JUDGE THAT ERIC SHOULD BE SPARED JAIL TIME 
ERIC WAS FACING A POSSIBLE TWO TO SEVEN YEAR PRISON SENTENCE AND HIS VICTIM FELT SOME TIME SHOULD BE SERVED 
FINALLY ON MARCH SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR THE CASE WAS HEARD BEFORE JUDGE JAMES IN THE WESTCHESTER COUNTY COURT HOUSE 
ERIC WALKED THROUGH THE FAMILIAR COURT HOUSE DOORS FOR THE FIRST TIME AS A DEFENDANT A CRIMINAL 
I AM SO APOLOGETIC 
IT'S JUST THE BILLS WERE MOUNTING UP 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
I DIDN'T GO TO HURT ANYBODY 
I NEVER WOULD HAVE HURT ANYBODY 
I JUST 
THE STORY STRUCK A SYMPATHETIC CHORD 
THE JUDGE GAVE ERIC NO JAIL TIME BUT INSTEAD SIX MONTHS HOUSE ARREST WITH AN ELECTRONIC MONITOR AND FIVE YEARS PROBATION WITH CONTINUED MANDATORY THERAPY AND REHABILITATION 
THE EX COP WOULD NOT BE PUT BEHIND BARS 
IT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL DECISION 
THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF READERS POLLED BY THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER FAVORED PRISON TIME AND THE LIQUOR STORE SALESMAN WHO LOOKED DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN WAS OUTRAGED 
I FEEL IT WAS TOTALLY UNJUST 
I I FELT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM FAILED 
A MAN COMMITS AND ARMED ROBBERY AND HE GETS A SLAP ON THE WRIST 
I FELT HE'S MAKING AN OPEN DOOR POLICY THAT YOU HAVE A STORY TO CRY ABOUT GO OUT AND ROB A STORE OR DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A GOOD STORY TO CRY ABOUT 
JUDGE THIS IS WIDELY VIEWED AS A LIGHT SENTENCE A SLAP ON THE WRIST 
YOU DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY 
NUMBER 
NUMBER 
I THINK IT'S AN ACCURATE AND A VERY FAIR REFLECTION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
THE LIKELIHOOD IS EXTREMELY REMOTE THAT HE WILL EVER BE A THREAT TO SOCIETY AGAIN 
AND PERHAPS NOW WITH THE TURN OF EVENTS THERE WILL BE SOME HOPE IN THE FUTURE FOR THIS FAMILY 
ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE THINGS FOR THEM THEY SAY HAS BEEN THE SUPPORT THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM CARING PEOPLE ALL OVER WHO HAVE HEARD ABOUT THEIR STORY 
I APPLAUD YOU AND YOUR WIFE FOR THE COURAGE YOU MUST HAVE TO KEEP THE FAMILY TOGETHER 
I WILL KEEP YOUR FAMILY IN MY PRAYERS 
DEAR LIZ AND ERIC I READ YOUR STORY IN THE NEWS AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU 
I HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I CAN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENING 
I JUST HOPE THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE LOVE THE PURE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE THAT I HAVE FOR HIM 
AND I LOVE HIM I LOVE HIM SO DEARLY 
TOM JARRIEL IS IN OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU RIGHT NOW 
AND THERE'S BEEN A VERY RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THIS STORY SINCE TOM FILED IT 
TOM TELL US ABOUT THAT 
HUGH THERE HAS 
JUST LAST NIGHT IN A BIZARRE TURN OF EVENTS MRS. WAS ARRESTED FOR GRAND LARCENY 
SHE'S SUSPECTED OF STEALING A COMPUTER 
SHE CLAIMS THROUGH HER AT THAT IT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING 
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THE LAW SHAKES IT DOWN 
BUT IT'S UNUSUAL BECAUSE THEY SEEMED TO BE DOING SO WELL 
YEAH IT'S VERY VERY STRANGE 
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT CHRISTOPHER THE LITTLE BOY 
WELL IF SHE'S FOUND TO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THIS IT COULD AFFECT HIM A GREAT DEAL 
THE STATE MIGHT MOVE IN AND TAKE OVER HIS CARE AND CUSTODY 
SHE AS WE KNOW HAS BEEN HIS PRIMARY 
THAT'S REALLY REALLY UNFORTUNATE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TOM 
CERTAINLY 
WELL NEXT PEOPLE CAN SPEND YEARS GETTING OVER A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE LIKE WAR OR RAPE 
AND NOW AN AMAZING NEW THERAPY IS HELPING PATIENTS LIKE THESE IN JUST HOURS 
WHEN WE COME BACK LYNN SHERR TAKES A CLOSE LOOK AT THIS STRANGE BUT SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT
