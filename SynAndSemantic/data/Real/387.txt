THERE'S NEW MOMENTUM TOWARD PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS MORNING 
ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN AND JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN WILL MEET AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT REPORTS MAY OR MAY NOT SIGN A JOINT DECLARATION WHICH WOULD END HOSTILITIES THAT HAVE EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES SINCE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
C. N. N. CORRESPONDENT JOHN HOLLIMAN IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS 
CAN YOU TELL US JOHN ON THE QUESTION OF WILL THEY OR WON'T THEY 
THEY'RE GOING TO SIGN SOMETHING BOB 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET WHAT IT IS AND I'LL TELL YOU SECURITY AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THIS VISIT BY THE KING OF JORDAN AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL IS TIGHTER THAN USUAL THIS MORNING 
WE'RE SPEAKING TO YOU KNOW FROM THE ROSE GARDEN 
IN ABOUT TWO HOURS FROM NOW WE'LL GET TO SEE THE TWO MIDDLE EASTERN LEADERS AND PRESIDENT CLINTON HERE IN A BRIEF ARRIVAL CEREMONY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT HAS INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE TALKS WITH EACH OF THEM AND THEN A JOINT TALK WITH THE TWO OF THEM AND THEN FINALLY AT THE END OF ALL THAT THERE WILL BE A SERIES OF JOINT STATEMENTS HERE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM ALL THREE LEADERS 
THE TWO LEADERS WILL BE ARRIVING AT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK EASTERN TIME TWO HOURS FROM NOW AT THE NORTHWEST GATE OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST PUBLIC MEETING FOR THEM 
THE RESULT IS EXPECTED TO BE A STATEMENT THAT HOSTILITIES ARE OVER AND A FULL FLEDGED PEACE AGREEMENT COULD BE COMING SOON 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S SPECIAL MID EAST COORDINATOR DENNIS ROSS SAYS THERE COULD BE SOME IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BECAUSE OF THE MEETING 
WELL I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MEETING AS HAVING SOMETHING THAT BOTH SYMBOL BECAUSE IT'S A MANIFESTATION OF PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AND RECOGNITION BUT ALSO SUBSTANCE 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ONE WILL SEE EMERGE HERE LATER TODAY 
NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE A MAJOR THRESHOLD BEING CROSSED IN TERMS OF THE MEETING BUT THEY WILL IN FACT THEY WILL PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTENT IN WHAT EMERGES FROM TODAY AND YOU'LL SEE AN OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS A PEACE TREATY 
YOU WILL SEE AN IN MOVEMENT TOWARDS COOPERATION AND YOU WILL SEE AN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO 
AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE 
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY AND A PEACE TREATY 
WELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND A PEACE TREATY IS THAT A PEACE TREATY BY DEFINITION IS A LOT MORE DETAILED 
EVERY ISSUE THAT IS OUT THERE TO BE RESOLVED OR IS LEFT OPEN IS HAS SOMEHOW BEEN DISCUSSED AND HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED 
WE'RE STILL AT A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE IN TERMS OF HAVING IDENTIFIED A VERY WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES BETWEEN THE PARTIES THAT THEY ARE STILL DISCUSSING 
BUT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS PARTICULAR TRACK RIGHT NOW IS AN EFFORT NOT ONLY TO NEGOTIATE THE DETAILS OF THE ISSUES THAT STILL SEPARATE THEM YOU SEE THEM ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE AND DEVELOP A WHOLE PROCESS OF COOPERATION 
C. N. N.'S LIVE COVERAGE OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWO LEADERS WILL BEGIN LESS THAN TWO HOURS FROM NOW TEN O'CLOCK EASTERN TIME AND IT'S EXPECTED PRIME MINISTER RABIN KING HUSSEIN AND PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AT ELEVEN FORTY A. M. 
EASTERN TIME 
C. N. N. WILL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF THAT AS WELL 
THEN TOMORROW THE TWO MIDDLE EASTERN LEADERS WILL GO TO CAPITOL HILL TO ADDRESS A JOINT MEETING OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 
THAT'S AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK EASTERN TIME AND AGAIN C. N. N. WILL BE THERE WITH LIVE COVERAGE
