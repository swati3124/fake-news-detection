HAVING A COUPLE OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS EACH DAY CAN MAKE UP LESS PRONE TO HEART DISEASE 
THAT IS SOMETHING SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS 
BUT NOW A NEW STUDY HELPS EXPLAIN WHY 
C. N. N.'S ELIZABETH SCHWARTZ HAS THE STORY 
WHAT DOES A BLOODY MARY HAVE IN COMMON WITH THIS MEDICINE 
ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY BOTH THE DRUG AND THE DRINK BOOST THE AMOUNT OF AN ENZYME THAT HELPS BREAK DOWN THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT CAN LEAD TO HEART DISEASE 
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DRINKING MORE SEEM TO BE PRODUCING MORE OF THIS POTENTIALLY PROTECTIVE ENZYME 
DOCTORS GIVE THE DRUG IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS AFTER SOMEONE'S HAD A HEART ATTACK 
BUT THE STUDY SHOWS THAT MODERATE DRINKING COULD HELP PREVENT HEART DISEASE 
THE HARVARD MEDICINE SCHOOL REPORT PUBLISHED IN THIS WEEK'S JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION LOOKED AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MALE PHYSICIANS 
THE ONES WHO DRANK TWO OR MORE DRINKS A DAY HAD A HIGHER LEVEL OF THE PROTECTIVE ENZYME THAN THOSE WHO DRANK ONE TO SIX DRINKS A WEEK OR ONE TO THREE DRINKS A MONTH OF WHO RARELY OR NEVER DRANK 
SO DOES THIS MEAN THE MORE YOU DRINK THE HEALTHIER YOU'LL BE 
NOT ON YOUR LIFE 
TWO DRINKS A DAY SEEMS TO WORK JUST FINE 
WHAT LOOKS CLEAR IS THAT THE MORE YOU DRINK THINGS DON'T GET BETTER 
THIS IS A CLEAR ISSUE OF MODERATION IS THE WAY TO GO HERE 
IN FACT YEARS OF EXCESSIVE DRINKING CAN CAUSE HEART DISEASE 
ALL IN ALL SOME ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO ALCOHOL FROM DISEASES LIKE CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER TO CAR ACCIDENTS 
DOCTORS SAY THE NEXT STEP IS TO DEVELOP A PILL THAT WOULD HAVE ALL THE GOOD AFFECTS OF ALCOHOL WITHOUT ANY OF THE BAD AFFECTS 
AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE AS MUCH FUND AS HAVING A FEW DRINKS IT COULD BE A LOT SAFER 
BYRON WILLIAMS A CARDIOLOGIST IN ATLANTA SAYS HE'S WAITING FOR JUST THAT KIND OF MEDICINE 
FOR NOW HE RECOMMENDS MODERATE DRINKING ONLY AFTER CHECKING A PATIENT'S FAMILY AND PERSONAL HISTORY OF ALCOHOLISM 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BENIGN FORM OF ALCOHOL IF YOU WILL AND WE'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT DOSE IS AND BE ABLE TO PRESCRIBE THAT FOR THE PATIENT 
IN THE MEANTIME IT SEEMS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A BIT OF BOTTOMS UP 
BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE AN ALL NIGHT PARTY OUT OF IT
