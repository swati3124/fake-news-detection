PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS THE LATEST NUMBERS ARE FURTHER PROOF THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS HIS PLAN FOR REDUCING THE DEFICIT 
HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE AND HIS STAFF NEED TO REFOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT 
AS THE PRESIDENT PUT IT TO GET OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S BRIT HUME 
IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED HE'S CONTEMPLATING SOME CHANGES IN THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF AS HE PREPARES A MAJOR PUSH TO GET HIS ECONOMIC PROGRAM THROUGH CONGRESS 
HE CONCEDED SOME OF THAT LASER FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY HE PROMISED HAS BEEN LOST 
ONE THING THAT YOU RISK WHEN YOU TRY TO GET A LOT OF THINGS GOING IN A HURRY IS THAT YOU WIND UP HAVING PEOPLE WORK VERY VERY HARD BUT MAYBE GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF FOCUS 
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BRING IT TIGHTEN THE FOCUS A LITTLE BIT 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO 
ON CAPITOL HILL THERE WERE CLEAR SIGNS THAT THE CLINTON PROGRAM'S MOMENTUM WHICH ONCE SEEMED UNSTOPPABLE HAS FADED JUST AS THE LARGE TAX INCREASES HE'S PROPOSED ARE BEING TAKEN UP 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROVISIONS IN THIS TAX BILL WE WOULD GET A MAJORITY FOR 
BUT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO RAISE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BY JUNE EIGHTEENTH 
IF MOYNIHAN IS WORRIED THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD BE TOO BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ON HIS COMMITTEE HAVE ONLY AN ELEVEN TO NINE MAJORITY MEANING ONE SWITCHED VOTE COULD BLOCK THE PROGRAM 
THE ASSESSMENT WAS A BIT MORE POSITIVE ON THE HOUSE SIDE 
BUT EVEN THERE THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN WAS MAKING NO PROMISES 
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THAT THE TASK BEFORE US IS ENORMOUS 
BUT I'M FIRMLY COMMITTED TO HELPING PRESIDENT CLINTON ACHIEVE HIS BASIC PLAN AND REACH HIS DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGETS 
REPUBLICANS WERE MAKING CLEAR TODAY THEY WILL RESIST 
I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THE DEFICIT IS HIGH BECAUSE WE SPEND TOO MUCH NOT BECAUSE WE TAX THE AMERICAN WORKERS TOO LITTLE 
THE REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH MILEAGE OUT OF THAT ISSUE SINCE GEORGE BUSH BROKE HIS NO NEW TAXES PROMISES THREE YEARS AGO 
BUT NOW WITH MR. CLINTON HAVING PROPOSED EVEN BIGGER NEW TAXES THE REPUBLICANS HOPE AT LEAST THEY'VE GO THE TAX ISSUE BACK
