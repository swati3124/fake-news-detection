ONE THING BOTH CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THEIR MILITARY HISTORY THOUGH THE STORIES THEY TELL ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
CLINTON IS STILL EXPLAINING HIS LACK OF MILITARY EXPERIENCE WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH IS STILL EXPLOITING HIS DISTINGUISHED MILITARY SERVICE 
REVEALING OR IRRELEVANT 
THE STORY FROM C. N. N.'S MARY TILLOTSON 
BILL CLINTON'S DRAFT RECORD IS HANGING OVER HIS HEAD LITERALLY 
A SMALL PLANE HAS TAKEN TO FOLLOWING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TRAILING THE SAME MESSAGE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN THAT BILL CLINTON AVOIDED SERVING IN VIETNAM 
IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY 
WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THESE BIG PROBLEMS BUT NOW IT'S A PROBLEM OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND CREDIBILITY 
WHO'S GOING TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO'S GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND WAR HERO BOB DOLE TOOK TO THE SENATE FLOOR TO SLAM CLINTON FOR HIS CONFLICTING STATEMENTS ABOUT CLINTON'S DRAFT STATUS IN THE VIETNAM ERA 
THAT WAS A CENTRAL THEME OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S LABOR DAY CAMPAIGN KICKOFF IN WISCONSIN 
AND HARRY TRUMAN WANTED TO JOIN THE MILITARY AND FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY AND SO DO I AND I DID 
HARRY TRUMAN WAS A MAN OF DECISIVENESS NOT EQUIVOCATION 
HE'D FIND LITTLE IN COMMON WITH THE GOVERNOR CLINTON A MAN WHO OR DUCKS ON ALMOST EVERY TOUGH ISSUE 
MAX FORMER HEAD OF THE VETERAN'S ADMINISTRATION TRIPLE FROM VIETNAM AND DEMOCRAT SAYS REPUBLICANS ARE FOCUSING ON VIETNAM TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 
ESPECIALLY FOR DAN QUAYLE TO THROW ROCKS AT BILL CLINTON OR THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET FOR FAILURE TO GO TO VIETNAM IS LIKE A FROG CALLING SOMEBODY ELSE UGLY 
I MEAN DAN QUAYLE DOESN'T HAVE LIVES IS A GLASS HOUSE IN TERMS OF SERVICE IN VIETNAM 
ONE OF THE VIETNAM VETERANS WHO WORKED HARDEST TO GET A FEDERAL MEMORIAL BUILT TO THAT WAR IS JAN SCRUGGS 
SCRUGGS SAYS QUESTIONING CLINTON'S RECORD LIKE QUESTIONS FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT WHY DAN QUAYLE DID NOT SERVE IN VIETNAM ARE PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE 
BUT SCRUGGS DOUBTS IT IS THE BIG CAMPAIGN ISSUE FOR MOST FOLKS 
TO MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA IT'S THEIR JOB AND THEIR FAMILY AND WHETHER THEY CAN EARN A LIVING AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR ECONOMIC WELL BEING THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE 
SCRUGGS SAYS THE CONTINUING INTEREST IN AND ANGER ABOUT WHO DID WHAT DURING VIETNAM IS A SURE SIGN AS HE PUTS IT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF HEALING TO BE DONE FROM THAT CONFLICT 
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THE MOST DIVISIVE WAR IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY STILL IS
