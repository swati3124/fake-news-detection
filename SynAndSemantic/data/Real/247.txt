HERSHEY PENNSYLVANIA IS AN INDUSTRIAL TOWN THAT HAS PROSPERED SINCE THE TURN OF THE CENTURY LIVING OFF OUR NATIONAL ADDICTION TO CHOCOLATE 
MORE SUSTAINING THAN MEAT WAS MILTON CLAIM FOR AN EARLY CHOCOLATE BAR 
BUT IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN HERSHEY INVENTED THE KISS AND IT IS STILL THE COMPANY'S BIGGEST SELLING CANDY 
THE KISS IS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE CANDY PRODUCTS IN THE COUNTRY ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN HALF A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BUSINESS EVERY YEAR 
WE WENT TO HERSHEY PENNSYLVANIA TO SEE HOW IT'S DONE 
THE KISS IS SIMPLE TO PRODUCE JUST A OF MELTED MILK CHOCOLATE ONTO A MOVING BELT 
NOTHING THAT HAS DONE SINCE AS IT CREATES NEW PRODUCTS FIGHTING TO STAY AT THE TOP OF A COMPETITIVE FIELD NOTHING HAS BEEN AS EASY OR AS ELEGANT AS THAT LITTLE CHOCOLATE DROP 
KISSES TUMBLE OUT OF A COOLER THAT HAS THEM UP AND JIM SANTANA WATCHES FOR KISSES GONE WRONG 
I'M INSPECTING FOR THE BAD KISSES 
EVERY HOUR I COME BACK AND I WEIGH THEM TO SEE THAT THEY'RE THE RIGHT WEIGHT AND THEN SEE THAT THEY'RE THE RIGHT SIZE 
IF THAT GOES ON THE THAT WOULD NOT WRAP BUT WHAT THAT WOULD DO THAT'LL MAKE THE JAM UP OUT THERE AND THE WOMEN OUT THERE WILL REALLY GET HOT THEN 
FROM THERE TO THE WRAPPING MACHINES AND THE WOMEN WHO MAKE THE FINAL CHECK FOR NUDE KISSES WE'RE TOLD NOT PROPERLY WRAPPED AND ONTO TO STORES 
THE GREAT SUCCESS OF KISSES HAS HAD SPECULATING FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS ON HOW TO DO WHAT MUST COME NATURALLY FROM KISSES HUGS 
I GUESS IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT AFTER SELLING KISSES FOR A QUARTER CENTURY OR SO THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO TRADEMARK THAT NAME AND AT SOME TIME WE'D FIND A USE FOR IT 
DENNIS IS DIRECTOR OF MARKETING 
BUT WHILE THE NAME WAS OBVIOUS THE EXECUTION WASN'T 
FOR YEARS DREAMERS EXPLORED POSSIBILITIES SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LINKED TO KISSES 
PRODUCT DEVELOPER JIM SPENT TIME ON IT OFF AN ON FOR THIRTEEN YEARS 
ONE OF THE INITIAL ONES WAS THE DONUT OKAY THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD YOU KNOW PACKAGE WITH KISSES YOU KNOW AND THEY WOULD KIND OF LIKE GO TOGETHER 
YOU KNOW DONUTS ON TOP OF THIS KISS 
THAT WAS ONE THAT DIDN'T GET VERY FAR 
HUGS AND KISSES AND CHOCOLATE ARE SEXY STUFF BUT THAT ONE WAS OVER THE LINE ALSO HARD TO WRAP 
MORE THINKING 
WHAT IF THE KISS DID THE HUGGING HAD SOMETHING INSIDE AN ALMOND 
QUICKLY WE REALIZED THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY IN GETTING AN ALMOND INSIDE A KISS AND OUR ENGINEERING GROUP WORKED QUITE A LONG TIME ON THAT 
WE EVENTUALLY DID 
ENGINEERS MANAGED TO ADD TO KISSES AND THE COMPANY HAD ITS HUG 
BUT A EMPLOYEE NAME LAURIE TOLD HER BOSS DENNIS THAT FOR HER IT DIDN'T WORK 
HE RECALLS THAT SHE SAID 
THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT 
THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HUGS THIS PRODUCT 
IT FEELS LIKE IT SHOULD BE KISSES WITH 
BUT YOU FELT THAT SHE REALLY I MEAN WHEN SHE SAID THAT YOU FELT SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT 
WELL SHE TOOK AWHILE TO CONVINCE ME BUT SHE WAS VERY PERSUASIVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY I THINK CONVINCED ME WAS HER POINT THAT HUGS COULD BE A WHOLE BUSINESS 
IT COULD HAVE ITS OWN WITH AND REALLY IT WAS THAT COMMENT THAT KIND OF THE LIGHT BULB WENT OFF IN MY HEAD SHE'S RIGHT 
KISSES WITH WAS AN INSTANT SUCCESS BUT THAT LEFT PRODUCT DEVELOPERS STILL IN SEARCH OF HUGS SOMETHING SMALL EASY TO WRAP THAT WENT WITH KISSES AND CONVEYED HUGS 
JIM AND HIS COLLEAGUES TRIED TEDDY BEARS CHOCOLATE BARRELS AND A KISS SHAPE WITH LITTLE HANDS ON ITS SURFACE 
YOU KNOW THE KISSES WERE HUGGING ITSELF 
THERE WERE ACTUALLY HANDS ON THE SURFACE LIKE THIS YOU KNOW EMBRACING THE KISS ITSELF 
I MEAN THAT'S WHERE WE WERE STRETCHING THIS 
WE HAD HUGS WE FIGURE WE'LL PUT HUGS ON THOSE KISSES HUGGING ITSELF AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MANUFACTURING NIGHTMARE 
WE FINALLY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THE THING THAT MAKES THE KISS SHAPE SO SPECIAL ISN'T REALLY THE SHAPE IT'S ALL THE EMOTION THAT GOES INTO EATING A KISS THE FOIL WRAP THE FLAG THE WAY YOU IT AND THE SHAPE ITSELF IS A SYMBOL FOR A LOT OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS PEOPLE HAVE FOR AND AND HOLIDAYS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS WHEN THEY'VE ENJOYED KISSES 
SO AFTER A LOT OF BANGING OUR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL WE CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT A HUG IN FACT HAD TO BE SHAPED LIKE A KISS 
AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT PRODUCT IT SHOULD BE WHAT SHOULD ITS INGREDIENTS BE 
AND THEN 
A BREAKTHROUGH IDEA 
WHITE CHOCOLATE 
A KISS THAT ISN'T A KISS MIGHT BE A HUG A KISS COVERED HUGGED WITH SOMETHING ELSE 
THEY MADE SOME KISSES COVERED WITH WHITE CHOCOLATE AND HANDED THEM AROUND THE COMPANY 
IT WAS FELT THAT THE WHITE SOLID WHITE PIECES LOOKED A LITTLE TOO MUCH LIKE HOTEL SOAP 
THE ANSWER WAS STRIPES MILK CHOCOLATE THE WHITE CHOCOLATE COATING OF A MINIATURE KISS 
IT WAS A CLEVER CONCEPT EASY TO MAKE BY HAND BUT TOUGH TO MANUFACTURE IN THE MILLIONS 
IF THE STRIPES GET TOO WIDE YOU GET TOO MUCH MILK CHOCOLATE PASTE WHICH THE TASTE OF THE WHITE CHOCOLATE 
SO THOUGHT THEY HAD A HUG BUT A HUG IS NOT A HUG UNLESS EMBRACED BY CONSUMERS 
IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT WE DON'T MAKE IT 
HUGS WERE A HIT IN TEST MARKETS 
HERSHEY RUSHED INTO PRODUCTION WITH A NEW PLANT AND SPECIALLY DESIGNED EQUIPMENT 
IN AUGUST THEY INTRODUCED HUGS AN ELEGANT CHOCOLATE KISS SHAPED CANDY BUT WHITE WITH MILK CHOCOLATE STRIPES 
BITE INTO IT AND IT HAS A THICK WHITE CHOCOLATE SHELL AROUND A MILK CHOCOLATE CENTER 
IT'S AND WRAPPED LIKE KISSES BUT THE FOIL IS ALSO STRIPED 
CANDY ANALYST DAVID OF KIDDER PEABODY SAYS IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING 
EARLY INDICATIONS FROM SOME DATA THAT I'VE SEEN AND SOME FOLKS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO CONSUMER TRIAL IS RUNNING VERY VERY STRONG 
THE REAL QUESTION AND SORT OF THE NEXT WAVE AFTER PEOPLE HAVE TRIED IT ONCE OR TWICE IN THE FLURRY OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY THAT ACCOMPANIES A NEW PRODUCT WHETHER THERE WILL BE SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE 
THE NEW HUGS PLANT IS STATE OF THE ART CANDY MAKING WE'RE TOLD 
APART FROM THE WRAPPING AND PACKING WE DIDN'T SEE MUCH 
WE CERTAINLY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO SEE THE BIRTH OF A HUG HOW THEY SLIP THAT KISS INSIDE THE STRIPED WHITE CHOCOLATE IS SOMETHING HERSHEY KEEPS SECRET 
WE ASKED ROD LOT ABOUT IT 
HE WAS ENGINEERING PROJECT MANAGER FOR HUGS 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAD TO DEAL WITH IS JUST THE HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MILK CHOCOLATE AND THE TECHNIQUE THAT WE USED TO MAKE THE STRIPES 
SO THAT WAS THE PART OF IT THAT WAS HARD TO COME BY 
I THINK THE THING THAT EVERYBODY WHO BITES INTO ONE IS HOW DO YOU GET SOMETHING THAT IS MADE OUT OF MELTED CHOCOLATE INTO SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO MADE OUT OF MELTED CHOCOLATE WITHOUT MELTING THE WHOLE THING 
I DON'T THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT 
WE DID GET A HINT 
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON EXISTING TECHNOLOGY 
WE ASKED THE PUBLISHER OF MAGAZINE TO TAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS 
ELIZABETH THOUGHT THE TRICK WOULD BE THE TEMPERATURE 
ONCE THEY PUT THE LITTLE HERSHEY KISSES BASICALLY THE EMBRYOS OF HUGS ON THE BELT MY BELIEF IS THAT THEY THEN PUT IT THROUGH ANOTHER WHAT THEY CALL AN WHICH IS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WHICH HAS LIKE A CURTAIN OF CHOCOLATE WHICH THEN BASICALLY GOES ALL OVER THE TOP OF THE HUG AND THE DIFFICULTY IS TO KEEP IT STICKING TO THEM 
YOU MEAN SO THAT YOU DON'T MELT THE LITTLE KISS PART 
YOU DON'T MELT THE LITTLE KISS AND ALSO SO THAT IT REALLY COVERS IT EVENLY 
I SEE 
SO IT IS A TEMPERATURE QUESTION 
MY BELIEF IS THAT IT IS A TEMPERATURE QUESTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT CAN BE VERY TOUGH 
THE OTHER THING OF COURSE ABOUT HUGS IS THE STRIPES 
YES AND THAT AGAIN IS A THIRD PROCESS WHERE THEY HAVE AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY CALL IT BUT IT'S AGAIN LIKE YOU WOULD DECORATE A CAKE YOU KNOW WITH BUT VERY VERY FINE 
I THINK THEY CALL IT A STRINGER AND IT'S BASICALLY VERY LITTLE THIN STRINGS OF CHOCOLATE THAT IT PASSES ON A BELT UNDERNEATH THIS AND THAT BASICALLY GOES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE BELT AND PUTS THAT PATTERN ON IT 
ALSO THINKS HUGS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL SHE LIKES ITS ELEGANCE 
HERSHEY HOPES THE COMBINATION OF CHOCOLATES WILL BE LIKE MILK AND COOKIES OR COFFEE AND CREAM TO CONSUMERS 
THERE IS OF COURSE AN OBVIOUS QUESTION 
FIRST KISSES THEN HUGS THEN WHAT 
THE OFFICIAL WORD FROM HERSHEY IS
