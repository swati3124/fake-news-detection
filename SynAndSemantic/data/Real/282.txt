CHANGE IN THE WELFARE SYSTEM IS ALSO IN THE AIR 
THE PRESIDENTIAL TASK FORCE IS STUDYING WELFARE REFORM 
C. N. N. SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WOLF BLITZER REPORTS ON WHAT MAY HAPPEN NEXT 
DORIS MORALES IS A SUCCESS STORY 
A SINGLE MOTHER WITH A TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SHE HAD BEEN ON WELFARE FOR NINE MONTHS BEFORE FLORIDA'S PROJECT INDEPENDENCE WORKED WITH HER TO FIND A JOB 
SHE SAYS SHE NEEDED A PUSH TO GET OFF WELFARE 
I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BECOME ABUSIVE NOT THROUGH JUST WELFARE BUT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE OFFERS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THESE PEOPLE FINALLY BACK OUT THERE NOT RELY ON THE PROGRAM SAY YOU KNOW FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO GO 
PRESIDENT CLINTON AGREES 
THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT CREATE SUCCESS 
THEY HAVE PEOPLE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE AREA OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE EDUCATED AND TRAINED 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE WELFARE REFORM AREA TO TAKE EDUCATION TRAINING AND MOVE FROM WELFARE TO WORK 
BUT OTHER ISSUES HAVE TAKEN PRIORITY AND EVEN THOUGH HIS AIDES HAVE PUT TOGETHER DOZENS OF RECOMMENDED REFORMS THEY DO NOT EXPECT LEGISLATION UNTIL HEALTH CARE REFORM IS WELL ALONG IN THE CONGRESSIONAL PROCESS 
BUT THEY INSIST IT IS COMING 
WE MAY HAVE TO FIND SAVINGS IN OTHER PROGRAMS TO PAY FOR WELFARE REFORM BUT THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WE SPEND BILLIONS ON WELFARE PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP PEOPLE ON WELFARE FOR LIFE AND WE WANT TO MAKE WELFARE A SECOND CHANCE NOT A WAY OF LIFE 
ONE WAY OF DOING THAT IS TO LIMIT BENEFITS 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WELFARE SYSTEM EXPECTS SOMETHING FROM EVERYBODY 
THAT'S WHY THE TWO YEAR TIME LIMIT IS SO IMPORTANT 
OTHER REFORMS UNDER CONSIDERATION INCLUDE PROHIBITING AID TO TEENAGERS UNLESS THEY LIVE WITH A PARENT OR A RESPONSIBLE ADULT AND OFFERING SUBSIDIES TO EMPLOYERS TO HIRE WELFARE RECIPIENTS SOMETHING VIRGINIA IS ALREADY DOING 
THIS HOSPITAL IN ALEXANDRIA IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE CITY 
WE THOUGHT IT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HIRE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WORK AND WHO WANT A JOB AND AT THE SAME TIME WORKED TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF THE LOCAL CITY FOLKS 
LIKE VIRGINIA AND FLORIDA OTHER STATES HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH WELFARE REFORM 
SOME OF THESE PROJECTS COULD SERVE AS MODELS FOR NATIONAL CHANGE 
MR. CLINTON IS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT WELFARE 
MANY BEFORE HIM HAVE TRIED BUT ALWAYS WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS 
HIS AIDES HOWEVER THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THE CONGRESS ARE NOW READY FOR ACTION
