THIS IS WEEKEND EDITION 
I'M ALEX 
ISN'T TRUE THAT SOMEONE COMES IN FROM OUT OF TOWN AND YOU'RE SHOWING THEM AROUND AND THEY NOTICE ALL THE STUFF THAT GETS BY YOU 
YOU USED TO SEE IT MAYBE BUT YOU DON'T ANYMORE THE WAY THE HILLS ROLL SAY OR THE BLUE THE NEIGHBORS CHOSE FOR THE FRONT DOOR OF THEIR PLACE 
THE PERSON FROM AWAY SEES DIFFERENTLY AND HEARS DIFFERENTLY TOO 
THAT TUNE WAS RECORDED AND PUBLISHED MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO IN NORTHWEST LOUISIANA IN SHREVEPORT BY A LITTLE COMPANY CALLED RAM RECORDS 
NO ONE'S HEARD MUCH OF THIS MUSIC LATELY OR OF RAM EITHER 
IT WENT OUT OF THE RECORDING BUSINESS DECADES AGO 
NOW A LONG TIME FAN OF AND RHYTHM AND BLUES AND THE LOUISIANA MIX OF FLAVORS AN ENGLISHMAN NAMED RAY TOPPING HAS ASSEMBLED THE FIRST OF WHAT ARE TO BE SEVERAL RAM RECORD 
AND THIS FIRST ONE IS CALLED SHREVEPORT STOMP 
THE RAM STORY IS ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE RAY TOPPING NOTES BECAUSE FORTY YEARS AGO IN SHREVEPORT THE ONLY MUSIC BUSINESS WAS A RADIO SHOW CALLED THE LOUISIANA WHICH LAUNCHED STARTS LIKE HANK WILLIAMS AND ELVIS PRESLEY AND MANY MANY OTHERS 
BUT AS SOON AS THEY GOT FAMOUS THEY WENT ELSEWHERE AND IF IT WOULD BE TOUGH FOR ANYONE TO START A RECORD LABEL IN SHREVEPORT IT WAS TOUGHER STILL IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THE FOUNDER OF RAM RECORDS WAS SMITH A GUITAR PLAYER A SINGER A SONGWRITER AND A WOMAN 
RAY TOPPING TALKED WITH US FROM OUR STUDIOS IN LONDON 
IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL FOR A WOMAN TO BE RUNNING A RECORD COMPANY AND I DON'T THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE LIKE THE DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER PEOPLE SORT OF THOUGHT SHE WAS SERIOUS LIKE 
YOU KNOW 
AND I THINK THAT STOOD IN THE WAY QUITE A BIT 
IT WASN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF THE MUSIC 
HOW DID SHE FIND THESE ARTISTS TO RECORD 
WELL FIRST OF ALL SHE WOULD HAND PICK PEOPLE WHAT APPEARED ON THE LOUISIANA AND THEN LATER ON SHE THEN DECIDED TO GO OUT ON SORT OF FIELD TRIPS AND SHE'D GO TO PLACES LIKE SOUTH LOUISIANA AND THAT'S WHERE SHE DISCOVERED ROY PERKINS ONE OF MY FAVORITES ON THE LABEL 
WAS THIS A HIT 
WAS THIS SONG A HIT 
NO NO 
I MEAN IN FACT BOB DART NEVER ACTUALLY GOT RELEASED AT THE TIME 
PUT IT OUT IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES ON A SPECIAL RAM RELEASE AND SHE PUT AN IN ONE OF THE RECORD MAGAZINES SAYING YOU CAN GET THESE OR OF SOME OLD RAM MATERIAL 
AND THAT'S HOW YOU HEARD ABOUT IT 
THAT'S HOW I HEARD ABOUT IT 
I'D SEEN THIS THAT SHE WAS SELLING THEM FOR YOU KNOW A DOLLAR A PIECE I THINK AND SENT ME MONEY OFF FOR THAT 
HOW IS IT THAT YOU FOUND AN AFFINITY AND LOVE FOR THIS MUSIC AND CAME OVER HERE AND KIND OF REDISCOVERED RAM 
WELL I THINK IT ALL STEMS FROM GROWING UP IN ENGLAND DURING THE LATE FIFTIES AND I WAS A BIG FAN OF ROCK 'N ROLL WHEN IT EMERGED IN ENGLAND YOU KNOW AND WE HEARD ALL THE AMERICAN RECORDINGS LIKE ELVIS AND JERRY LEE LEWIS AND IT WAS REALLY MY LOVE OF THE MUSIC FROM THE STATES AND PARTICULARLY THE SOUTHERN STATES SOMEHOW THAT FEELINGS THERE ON THOSE RECORDS OUT OF THE SOUTHERN STATES WHICH IS OFTEN LACKING IN THE RECORDS FROM SAY NEW YORK AND PLACES 
DID RAM RECORDS EVER HAVE A REAL HIT 
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST SONG THEY DID 
WELL I WOULD SAY PROBABLY SAM BY T. V. SLIM WHICH OBVIOUSLY SOLD PRETTY WELL BECAUSE SHE CUT THE ORIGINAL VERSION WHICH IS ON THIS C. D. AND THEN CHESS GOT HOLD OF IT FOR DISTRIBUTION AND THEY SAID COULD YOU GO AND RECORD IT AGAIN BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT IT COULD BE UP A BIT MORE 
SO SHE WENT DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS AND GOT IT AGAIN WITH FATS BAND 
AND THEN IT LOST MOMENTUM BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION WHICH IS ON THIS C. D. WAS GETTING ALL THE ACTION AROUND TEXAS LOUISIANA 
YEAH IT'S GOT A GREAT KIND OF ENERGY IN IT DOESN'T IT 
YES AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED IS WHEN THEY IT IT WAS A MORE FASTER VERSION MORE VERSION BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE OF THE FIRST VERSION 
DID ANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT SMITH DISCOVERED GO ON TO BE BIG STARS 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ON THE LABEL THERE ACTUALLY WENT ON TO BE A BIGGER STAR 
I MEAN I THINK IT IS A SITUATION AGAIN RAM JUST DIDN'T HAVE THAT CLOUT TO GET IT ALL AROUND AMERICA 
BUT SEE THE OTHER THING IS ALEX YOU GOT TO REALIZE IS THAT DURING THAT FIFTIES PERIOD PAYOLA PLAYED A BIG IMPORTANT PART IN THE RECORD BUSINESS 
IN GETTING ARTISTS HEARD 
YEAH IN GETTING ARTISTS HEARD YES 
YOU HAD TO BE ABLE TO PAY TO GET THE PLAY ON THE AIR AND SMITH AND RAM RECORDS THEY WERE JUST TOO LITTLE 
TOO LITTLE 
SHE COULDN'T AFFORD THAT PAYOLA WHICH SOME OF THE BIG NORTHERN COMPANIES WERE PAYING OUT YOU KNOW TO DISC AND CONSEQUENTLY YOUR STUFF JUST GOT YOU KNOW SHE WOULD SEND THEM OFF TO BILLBOARD FOR REVIEW 
SHE WOULD HAVE SENT THEM TO DIFFERENT RADIO STATIONS BUT UNLESS YOU HAD THAT CLOUT THAT'S WHY THE RECORDS NEVER GOT PLAYED ENOUGH OR PLAYED AT ALL BY CERTAIN RADIO STATIONS 
WHAT ABOUT A SONG LIKE RED BEANS AND RICE 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT 
WELL THAT ONE AGAIN AS FAR AS I KNOW DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE 
IT MAY HAVE GOT SOME LOCAL RADIO PLAY IN LOUISIANA BUT AS FAR AS MY KNOWLEDGE GOES IT DIDN'T GET ANYWHERE AT THE TIME WHICH IS STRANGE 
VERY STRANGE 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STRANGE LISTENING TO YOU AND LISTENING TO THIS MUSIC IS THAT SOMEONE WHO IS SO OBVIOUSLY NOT AN AMERICAN MAY HAVE DISCOVERED THESE TREASURES OF AMERICAN MUSIC AND RESTORED THEM TO US 
YES I YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK I'VE GONE A LONG WAY TO BE DOING THAT 
IN ENGLAND HERE WE SORT OF PROBABLY PUT A LOT MORE EFFORT INTO SORT OF DISCOVERING AMERICAN MUSIC THAN PROBABLY THE AMERICANS DO 
NOW THEY ARE GETTING IN ONTO IT A BIT MORE NOW IN THE STATES BUT I MEAN WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS NOW FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AND IT'S STILL YOU KNOW WE STILL GOT LOTS MORE THINGS TO FIND STILL 
I'VE GOT A LIST AS LONG AS YOUR ARM OF MORE LABELS TO PICK UP 
I'M STILL CURRENTLY CHECKING OUT A FEW MORE PEOPLE DOWN SOUTH WITH SOME AMAZING RECORDINGS 
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE END OF IT 
RAY TOPPING IN LONDON TALKING ABOUT HIS LATEST COMPILATION OF MUSIC SHREVEPORT STOMP FROM ACE RECORDS 
LISTENING TO THIS C. D. IN AN OFFICE AT NPR WITH THE DOOR OPEN AND SPEAKERS THERE WAS ONE CUT IN PARTICULAR THAT HAD PEOPLE ASKING IF THIS WAS PATSY CLINE 
NO IT IS NOT PATSY CLINE 
IT IS MARGARET LEWIS WHO CO WROTE RECONSIDER ME A HIT FOR RHYTHM AND BLUES ARTIST JOHNNY ADAMS BUT THIS DEMO VERSION OF MARGARET LEWIS SINGING LEAD AND BACKUP VOCALS AND PLAYING GUITAR AND DRUMS WITH SMITH ALSO ON GUITAR THIS VERSION WAS NEVER RELEASED UNTIL NOW 
MARGARET LEWIS LIVES IN SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA 
WE REACHED HER IN A STUDIO THERE TO ASK WHY WE'VE NEVER HEARD HER VERSION OF HER OWN SONG 
WELL THAT'S ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS 
YOU KNOW I MADE A LOT OF 
AS A LOT OF SONGWRITERS OR YOU KNOW SINGER SLASH SONGWRITERS I WAS CONCENTRATING MOSTLY ON WRITING SONGS AND LOOKING BACK I THINK YOUR QUESTION'S VERY VALID 
I SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY CONCENTRATED MORE ON THE SINGING 
SOMEHOW NATIONAL STARDOM PASSED BY MARGARET LEWIS DESPITE THAT EXTRAORDINARY VOICE AND EARLY RECOGNITION 
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE STARTED HER OWN BAND MARGARET LEWIS AND THE 
SHE WON A LOCAL TALENT CONTEST WHICH MEANT A TRY OUT WITH THE LOUISIANA IN SHREVEPORT AND THERE SHE MET THE OWNER OF RAM RECORDS SMITH 
MARGARET LEWIS WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN SHE MADE HER FIRST RECORDING FOR RAM CAN'T WIN 
BUT RAM RECORDS WAS COMPETING WITH COMPANIES LIKE ATLANTIC AND IMPERIAL AND CHESS RECORDS 
AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY TOUGH FOR A WOMAN MARGARET LEWIS SAYS EVEN ONE AS DETERMINED AS SMITH 
IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT IT WAS ALSO A LOT OF FUN YOU KNOW HAVING A STUDIO GETTING TO GO IN AND EXPERIMENT WITH THE MUSIC AND WORKING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT MUSICIANS AND SINGERS AND PEOPLE THAT WERE PASSING THROUGH OR LIVING IN SHREVEPORT AT THE TIME AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CLOSED DOWN IN NINETEEN SIXTY SO SHREVEPORT BECAME MUSICALLY AN TOWN FOR MANY YEARS 
NASHVILLE OF COURSE WENT JUST THE OPPOSITE 
THEY PROMOTED THE MUSIC THERE AND IT BECAME OF COURSE A RECORDING CENTER 
PEOPLE WERE GOING UP TO THE GRAND OLE AND THAT RADIO SHOW WAS REALLY TAKING OFF THEN 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MARGARET LEWIS AND SMITH TRIED NASHVILLE FOR A WHILE BUT TWENTY YEARS AGO FINALLY DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN RAM RECORDS 
EVENTUALLY BOTH WOMEN RETURNED TO SHREVEPORT WHERE MARGARET CONTINUES AS A SINGER TODAY 
SHE'S MARRIED TO SMITH'S COUSIN ALTON WARWICK AND WHEN DIED OF LEUKEMIA A FEW YEARS AGO MARGARET LEWIS BECAME CO OWNER OF THE LONG NEGLECTED RAM RECORDS ARCHIVES 
AND THEN ONE SUNDAY EVENING ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE TELEPHONE RANG AND THERE CALLING FROM ENGLAND WAS RAY TOPPING 
WE GOT A PHONE CALL OH I GUESS ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND THIS ENGLISH VOICE COMES ON THE PHONE 
MY HUSBAND ANSWERED AND IT'S RAY TOPPING FROM ENGLAND JUST OUT OF THE BLUE WANTING TO KNOW IF WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE RAM RECORDS 
SO ALTON SAID YES AND SO THE END OF CONVERSATION IS IT PROGRESSED TO HE ASKED ALTON IF HE KNEW THE SINGER MARGARET LEWIS AND ALTON SAID WELL I CERTAINLY DO 
IN FACT SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN NOW FIXING A BIT OF SUPPER 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO HER SO THEN THAT'S HOW WE MET RAY TOPPING AND HE'S SINCE BEEN OVER TO SHREVEPORT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND STARTED GOING THROUGH THESE BOXES AND BOXES OF RAM TAPES THAT HAVE BEEN STORED THIRTY YEARS OR SO AND REDISCOVERING ALL OF THIS STUFF 
IT IS A TOTAL SURPRISE TO ME BECAUSE WE SORT OF THOUGHT YOU KNOW THAT WAS ALL IN THE PAST 
YOU WERE IN A STUDIO DOWN THERE IN SHREVEPORT NOW 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I WONDER YOU HAVE YOUR INSTRUMENT WITH YOU 
YES 
COULD YOU PLAY SOMETHING FOR US THAT YOU PLAY NOW WHEN YOU GO OUT TO SING 
I HAVE MY GOOD FRIEND BUDDY FLECK WITH ME 
BUDDY IS ONE OF THE FLECK BROTHERS WHO HAVE THE GROUP THE 
HE'S GOING TO JOIN ME IN THE STUDIO AND MAYBE WE COULD JUST DO A LITTLE BLUES NUMBER OR SOMETHING 
YEAH THAT'D BE GREAT 
WELL LET ME JUST SAY THAT WAS TERRIFIC AND YOU OUGHT TO BE OUT ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME WITH A BAND 
OH I'D LOVE IT 
I'M READY TO GO 
LOOKING BACK MARGARET LEWIS ON WHAT HAPPENED WITH RAM RECORDS WITH THE LOUISIANA CLOSING DOWN AND MUSIC MOVING AWAY FROM SHREVEPORT BIG COMMERCIAL MUSIC DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MISSED OUT ON STUFF THAT SOMEHOW IT DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR YOU 
WELL I GUESS I DO ACTUALLY 
I FEEL LIKE THAT IS A MISSING PART OF MY LIFE AND MY CAREER BECAUSE I LOVE TO SING AND I LOVE TO PERFORM AND IF THROUGH THE BLESSING OF FATE AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN NOW I WOULD BE MOST GRATEFUL 
MARGARET LEWIS GOOD LUCK TO YOU 
THANK YOU ALEXANDER 
LET'S GO OUT ON ONE MORE IF WE COULD 
WELL HOW ABOUT RECONSIDER ME 
O. K. THAT'S GREAT
