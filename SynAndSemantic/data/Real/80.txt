TWO LONG TIME POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THE ELECTORAL LANDSCAPE LOOKS PRETTY BLEAK FOR GEORGE BUSH 
ROBERT NOVAK OF THE EVANS NOVAK POLITICAL REPORT MAPS IT THIS WAY 
FIFTEEN STATES MANY IN THE SOUTH LIKELY OR LEANING FOR BUSH TOTAL ELECTORAL TAKE INCLUDING TEXAS AND FLORIDA ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN 
THAT'S FAR SHORT OF THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY NEEDED TO WIN 
LIKELY OR LEANING FOR CLINTON THE REMAINING THIRTY FIVE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
THE DEMOCRATIC ELECTORAL TALLY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE 
SYNDICATED COLUMNIST MARK SHIELDS PRETTY MUCH AGREES WITH NOVAK'S ELECTORAL SNAPSHOTS 
HE'S GOT AN EVEN ASSESSMENT OF THE BUSH SITUATION 
SUBTRACTING LOUISIANA NORTH CAROLINA AND TEXAS FROM THE G. O. P. COLUMN HE PUTS LOUISIANA AND NORTH CAROLINA AS LEANING TO CLINTON 
AND HE VIEWS THE LONE STAR STATE AS A TOSS UP 
JOINING US NOW COLUMNIST MARK SHIELDS NOT RUSSELL WHO'S HERE IN WASHINGTON AND ROBERT NOVAK OF THE CHICAGO SUN TIMES WHO IS IN LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS 
ROBERT WHY THE LATEST ON THIS MAP 
WELL THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH CHANGE FROM WHAT WE HAD TWO WEEKS AGO 
WE DID PUT MOVE LOUISIANA WHICH I'M CONVINCED OF FROM CLINTON TO BUSH 
WE PUT TWO OTHER STATES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION MOSTLY BECAUSE WE WERE JUST LATE IN CATCHING UP WITH IT GEORGIA AND SOUTH DAKOTA 
ACTUALLY BERNIE OUR MAP IS A LITTLE BIT OPTIMISTIC FROM BUSH'S STANDPOINT BECAUSE TEXAS IS AS MARK SAYS VIRTUALLY A TOSS UP 
WE'RE JUST NOT A LITTLE CHICKEN LIKE MARK WHO CALLS TOSS UPS 
WE CALL EVERYTHING 
AND THE OTHER ONE IS FLORIDA 
FLORIDA THE CLINTON PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE AHEAD IN FLORIDA 
I STILL THINK BUSH IS SLIGHTLY AHEAD BUT IT'S ALMOST A TOSS UP 
YOU PUT FLORIDA AND TEXAS IN THE CLINTON COLUMN AND YOU'VE GOT AN ELECTORAL VOTE LANDSLIDE 
MARK SHIELDS WHY IS TEXAS A TOSS UP 
TEXAS IS A TOSS UP BECAUSE OF THE IN A BIG FOOTED WAY OF ROSS PEROT 
ROSS PEROT IS THE WILD CARD IN THIS ELECTION ONLY IN TERMS OF THE DEBATE WHICH I THINK HE CAN INFLUENCE AND I THINK PROBABLY WILL BEGINNING SUNDAY NIGHT 
BUT CERTAINLY IN TEXAS HE IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH 
I THINK BERNIE JUST ONE THING I'D ADD TO WHAT BOB THE POINTS THAT BOB WAS MAKING 
WHAT IS MOST INTERESTING PERHAPS IS NOT THE AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT BUT THE AREAS OF AGREEMENT 
WE'RE LOOKING AT STATES LIKE ILLINOIS AND NEW JERSEY THAT HAVE NOT VOTED DEMOCRATIC SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY INCLUDING CALIFORNIA OF COURSE EVERYBODY IS CONCEDING AT THIS POINT OR PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS CONCEDING TO BILL CLINTON 
WE'RE TALKING BEYOND THE AND THE NEW WHICH WAS WELL WHICH WENT ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR CONNECTICUT TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
I MEAN THIS IS AN ENORMOUS CHANGE IN THE AMERICAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
SO WHAT MUST GEORGE BUSH DO BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER THIRD TO TRY TO TURN AROUND WHAT YOU GUYS SEE AS HIS FATE AWAITING HIM 
THEORETICALLY BERNIE HE HAS TO SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HIS SECOND TERM WILL BE BETTER THAN HIS FIRST THAT HE STANDS FOR SOMETHING 
HE'S BEEN UNABLE TO DO THAT 
HE HASN'T DONE THE THINGS THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE LIKE INTRODUCING A NEW TEAM NEW CABINET MEMBERS 
ACTUALLY MAKING SOME CABINET CHANGES HAVING A VERY STEADY AGENDA FOR THE SECOND TERM 
SO WHAT HE IS LEFT WITH SINCE HE'S UNABLE TO DO THAT AND IT'S REALLY TOO LATE TO DO THAT IS HE MUST MAKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL THAT BILL CLINTON IS TOO BIG A RISK TO TAKE AND THEY EITHER HAVE GOT TO GO FOR PEROT OR FOR BUSH 
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT CLINTON'S TRIP TO RUSSIA AND HIS ORGANIZING OF STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS DURING THE VIETNAM WAR 
MARK 
BERNIE LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE ONLY HOPE THAT GEORGE BUSH HAS LEFT IS TO SOMEHOW PERSUADE VOTERS LOOK I'M NOT DAY AT THE BEACH BUT THE OTHER GUY'S NO MONTH IN THE COUNTRY 
AND SOMEHOW CONCENTRATE THE DOUBTS RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT BILL CLINTON 
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU 
I THINK GOING BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND A CHRISTMAS TRIP TO MOSCOW IS A REACH BEYOND MOST PEOPLE'S EVEN REMOTE UNDERSTANDING 
I MEAN WHAT'S HE SUGGESTING 
THAT WE'VE GOT A CANDIDATE ON OUR HANDS 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN PLANTED WITH A TIME CAPSULE THAT UPON THE MOMENT HE TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE I MEAN THIS IS TRULY BIZARRE 
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I RALLY THINK I MEAN IT TELLS YOU SOMETHING PRETTY SAD ABOUT GEORGE BUSH SIXTY EIGHT YEARS OLD RUNNING FOR REELECTION TWO TERMS AS VICE PRESIDENT ONE TERM AS PRESIDENT AND HE'S INTO SORT OF THIS SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE OVER CHRISTMAS 
IT JUST IT WON'T FLY 
WELL GO AHEAD BOB 
LET ME MAKE TWO POINTS ON IT 
I WAS I'M IN LITTLE ROCK AND I WAS WITH SOME CLINTON PEOPLE LAST NIGHT AND THEY WERE FLABBERGASTED BY IT 
YOU KNOW THEY WERE ANGRY BUT IT IS IT IS A SHOCK IN THE TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
AND IT MAY NOT WORK IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK 
BUT IT DOES SHAKE UP THE TABLE A LITTLE BIT 
SECONDLY IF BUSH WAS GOING TO DO IT WHAT HE HAD TO DO IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DRAFT 
OF SAYING THAT HERE WAS A GUY WHO WAS AVOIDING THE DRAFT WHO WAS AVOIDING THE DRAFT WHO HAD ON A COMMITMENT FOR AN AIR FORCE R. O. T. C. AND THEN HE GOES TO RUSSIA 
BUT JUST TO THROW IT OUT WHAT WAS HE DOING IN RUSSIA IS SILLY 
I THINK BOB IS I THINK BOB IS RIGHT ON THIS ONE 
AND I JUST WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT'S BILL CLINTON IS CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT THE EVENTS OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE 
BUT THIS IS NOT THE VULNERABLE POINT FOR GEORGE BUSH 
WE'RE GOING INTO A DEBATE WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS THINK THE ECONOMY IS HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND THE COUNTRY IS SERIOUSLY OFF ON THE WRONG TRACK 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE ANSWER TO GEORGE BUSH'S PROBLEMS 
ONE WORD 
IS BUSH DESPERATE 
OF COURSE HE'S DESPERATE 
I DON'T THINK HE'S PATHETIC AS CLINTON SAYS 
THEY KEEP USING WORDS PATHETIC AND DESPERATE 
WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DESPERATE 
THERE'S THIRTY TWO THIRTY ONE DAYS LEFT AND NOTHING IS WORKING 
NOTHING IS WORKING FOR BUSH 
ALL RIGHT 
LET ME ASK YOU 
NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT EACH OF YOU HAS SAID ABOUT BUSH AND MOSCOW AND CLINTON WHICH SEGMENT OF THE NATION'S POPULATION WHICH SECTION OF THE COUNTRY WOULD BUSH'S INNUENDO ABOUT BILL CLINTON RESONATE 
I THINK BERNIE THAT IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES WHERE MILITARY SERVICE MORE THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A RESPECTED AND EVEN REVERED PROFESSION AND A SECTION OF THE COUNTRY WHICH EVER SINCE THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN MORE NATIONALISTIC THAN THE NATION AS A WHOLE 
I THINK THAT IS THE HOPE 
THE OTHER THING IS BERNIE IT'S PUTTING HEROIN INTO THE BLOODSTREAM 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
YOU DROP A LITTLE POISON IN LIKE THIS IT NEVER REALLY GOES AWAY 
IT'S LIKE THE CHARGE OF SENATOR STEVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THAT KITTY DUKAKIS MICHAEL WIFE HAD PARTICIPATED IN A FLAG BURNING 
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SUPPORT IT NOTHING TO SUBSTANTIATE IT 
BUT IT'S JUST TO TRY AN PLANT A DOUBT AND IT'LL BE THERE IN PEOPLE'S MINDS 
BUT IT IS THE ONLY THING PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT 
IT WAS THE SOUND BITES LEADING OFF THIS MORNING'S NEWS PROGRAMS 
THERE'S NO DISCUSSION TODAY OF THE COMPARATIVE TAX PROGRAMS 
WELL IS THIS AS SOME HAVE SAID 
WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW I KNEW JOE MCCARTHY AND AH 
GEORGE BUSH IS NO JOE MCCARTHY 
GEORGE BUSH IS NO JOE MCCARTHY 
I MEAN 
WHO ARE YOU FLATTERING THERE BOB 
JOE DIDN'T DO ANY INNUENDO 
I MEAN JOE JOE WOULD HAVE SAID THE GUY WAS A COMMUNIST 
SO PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN A LOT MORE DELICATE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
NO I WOULDN'T CALL THIS 
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE ANGER ON GOVERNOR CLINTON'S PART IN HIS RESPONSE AND REACTION TO HIM 
WELL BUT WAIT A MINUTE MARK 
YOU KNOW CLINTON HAS A REPUTATION OF HAVING A TEMPER 
AS A CAMPAIGNER WOULD HE WANT TO SHOW THAT TEMPER 
I TELL YOU 
I MEAN WHEN A CHARGE IS MADE AND IT'S TOTALLY BASELESS WHICH THE CLINTON PEOPLE INSIST THAT IT IS AND CERTAINLY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION HAS SUGGESTED SO FAR THAT IT IS THEN LEGITIMATE ANGER COMMENSURATE WITH THE CHARGE WHICH IS A SERIOUS CHARGE IS ABSOLUTELY EXPECTED BY PEOPLE AND THEY'RE WILLING TO NOT ONLY TO TOLERATE THEY'RE KIND OF DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DON'T SEE IT 
WELL LET ME AGREE WITH MARK ON THAT THAT THE OBVIOUSLY I THINK EVERYTHING THAT GOVERNOR CLINTON DOES IS CALCULATED 
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN AND A VERY GOOD ONE 
AND HE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS VERY SOFT TONE 
AND I THINK THE SOFT TONE MAKES PEOPLE SAY HEY WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE 
WAS THERE SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON 
GENTLEMEN NICE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS 
CATHERINE 
THANKS BERNIE
