WELCOME BACK 
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED KIDS WHO GO TO HEMPSTEAD HIGH SCHOOL IN TEXAS ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN GIRLS ON THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD FOR THE HEMPSTEAD FOOTBALL TEAM 
BUT FOUR OF THOSE FIFTEEN CHEERLEADERS GOT PREGNANT AND GOT KICKED OFF THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD 
ONE OF THE PREGNANT GIRLS HAD AN ABORTION SHE'S NOW PERMITTED TO CHEER AGAIN 
NO ONE IN HEMPSTEAD TEXAS CLAIMS THESE ARE FOUR IMMACULATE BUT NO BOYS HAVE BEEN NAMED OR PENALIZED FOR THE GIRLS 
TO CYNTHIA WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS CAUTIONARY TALE 
WHAT'S THE CAUTION HERE 
WELL THE CAUTION IS THAT TEENAGERS ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE AT YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
I HOPE WE DON'T DRAW A LESSON FROM THIS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING BAD IN THE WATER IN HEMPSTEAD OR THAT HEMPSTEAD PARENTS ARE PARTICULARLY BAD OR THAT KIDS IN HEMPSTEAD ARE PARTICULARLY BAD 
HEMPSTEAD IS A MICROCOSM OF THE NATION 
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IN A TOWN AS SMALL AS HEMPSTEAD IT OUGHT TO SPEAK TO PARENTS AND TEACHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THAT WE'VE GOT TO COME OUT OF OUR DENIAL ABOUT SEXUAL ACTIVITY AMONG TEENS 
MANY TEENS ARE NOW SEXUALLY ACTIVE AND WE'VE GOT TO TEACH THEM 
WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM BOTH ABSTINENCE AND USING CONTRACEPTIVES 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EITHER SLASH OR PROPOSITION 
WE'VE GOT TO TEACH THEM BOTH 
BUT IT MAY BE CONTRADICTORY AS A PROPOSITION 
WELL I DON'T THINK IT IS AT ALL 
I DON'T THINK IT'S CONTRADICTORY 
WELL I THINK THAT'S WHAT OUR MORAL DILEMMA IS 
I THINK ALL THE CULTURAL MESSAGES COMING TO THE CHILDREN IS THAT EVERYTHING IS O. K. 
WHAT WE HAVE TO REALLY WORRY ABOUT ARE THE CHILDREN THAT ARE COMING INTO THE WORLD TO YOUNG GIRLS BABIES HAVING BABIES AS JESSE JACKSON PUTS IT 
WE'VE GOT TO SAY THAT'S WRONG 
IT'S WRONG TO HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH A BOY WHO WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WHO WILL NOT BE A FATHER 
IT'S WRONG TO BE A PREMATURE MOTHER 
I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE MESSAGES TALK ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG 
TO BE A CHEERLEADER IS AN HONOR 
YOU SHOULD BE EXEMPLARY NOT ONLY BY THE ABILITY TO AND BEING POPULAR BUT ALSO 
BUT SUZANNE 
CHARACTER AND GOOD CONDUCT 
ISN'T IT SO HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE 
YOU KNOW WE CAN REMEMBER WHEN GIRLS GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL IF THEY GOT PREGNANT 
THE BOY NEVER DID 
AND SO NOW WE HAVE SOCIETY THINKING THAT WAS PUNITIVE TOWARD ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE INVOLVED 
AND HARD TO DECIDE HOW TO BE SYMPATHETIC AND DISCOURAGE THIS 
WE'VE GOT TO PUT THE BENCH THE BOYS TOO 
ONE OF THE RUMORS IS THAT ONE OF THE FATHERS IS A FOOTBALL PLAYER 
IF THAT WERE STATED BY ONE OF THE GIRLS THEN BENCH THE FOOTBALL PLAYER 
LET'S BRING HONOR CHARACTER RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT BACK TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN ROLES OF LEADERSHIP 
YEAH IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE YOU KNOW HIGH MINDED WORDS 
AND YET IT'S VERY HARD TO DEMONSTRATE TO A LOT OF TEENAGERS TODAY THAT THERE IS VALUE IN NOT HAVING A PREGNANCY THAT EARLY IN LIFE 
BUT ELEANOR WHY TODAY AND NOT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
MANY OF THESE YOUNG GIRLS BELIEVE THAT IF YOU HAVE A BABY IT'S SOME SORT OF A TROPHY 
I MEAN THE CULTURE HAS CHANGED AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR LIVES WILL BE 
I DON'T MIND THAT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE CHEERLEADERS 
I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THE PREGNANCY 
BUT I COMMEND THE SCHOOL FOR KEEPING THE GIRLS THERE 
AND AS FOR THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD THE ABORTION SHE'S ALLOWED TO 
BUT I UNDERSTAND SHE'S AFRAID SHE'S GOING TO GET 
BOOED 
BOOED BY SOME PARENT WHO FEEL THAT THIS SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE THAT YOU SHOULD GO ON AND HAVE A BABY 
AND SO I THINK THE MESSAGE IS REALITY 
IF YOU GO AHEAD AND HAVE AN ABORTION YOU CAN CONTINUE WITH YOUR LIFE 
AND WE NEED TO FACE REALITY MORE IN DEALING WITH TEENAGERS 
WHY DO WE THROW UP OUR HANDS AND SAY WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING 
I DIDN'T THROW UP MY HANDS 
WELL SUZANNE WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO DO ANYTHING 
I MEAN WE HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE REALISTIC ABOUT THE MESSAGES TEENAGERS ARE GETTING FROM POPULAR CULTURE 
IT'S VERY WELL TO SAY TEENAGERS SHOULDN'T HAVE SEX BUT THE MESSAGES THEY'RE CONSTANTLY GETTING FROM POPULAR CULTURE SUGGEST THAT CHASTITY IS NOT COOL THAT SEX IS O. K. 
AND IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT WE'RE STILL SENDING THOSE MESSAGES ESPECIALLY TO TEENAGE BOYS 
IN TEENAGE BOYS IS STILL CONSIDERED AN ASSET 
WE GLORIFY THAT 
SO HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY EXPECT TEENAGERS TO JUST SAY NO THAT'S A PERFECTLY UNREALISTIC ATTITUDE 
WELL WAIT A MINUTE IT WASN'T UNREALISTIC TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE 
THERE WASN'T AS MUCH SEX IN THE POPULAR CULTURE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T SAY NO THEN EITHER 
THEY DID GO ON 
THERE WERE A LOT OF SHOTGUN MARRIAGES 
THAT'S A PHRASE THAT YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH TODAY 
BUT YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF ILLEGITIMACY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE INCREASING NUMBERS OF ILLEGITIMACY IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY 
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS BRINGING CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD WITH EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL DEFICITS 
WE SHOULD CHANGE THE CULTURAL MESSAGE 
SUZANNE RIGHT WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT 
EXACTLY 
WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT 
YOU NEED TO HAVE A CLINIC ON THE SCHOOL GROUNDS THAT TALKS ABOUT AS CYNTHIA PUT IT BOTH ABSTINENCE AND 
BUT WE ALL KNOW ALL OF US KNOW SEX SELLS AND THAT'S WHY T. V. DOES THAT AND THAT'S WHY MOVIES DO THAT 
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT SUZANNE 
WELL YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THE AUTHORITIES AT HIGH SCHOOLS SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET PREGNANT AND YOU ARE GOING TO A YOUNG TEENAGER YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE FOOTBALL SQUAD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE HONOR SOCIETY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD 
AT ONE TIME WE HAD GREAT FAITH IN OUR MORAL AUTHORITIES OF ADULTS 
NOW WE GIVE CONDOMS OUT IN THE SCHOOLS AND THE YOUNG BOYS SAY TO THE GIRLS LOOK THE SCHOOL IS BEHIND THIS 
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH DOING IT 
THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE OF GIVING OUT CONDOMS IN SCHOOLS 
WELL I THINK IT IS 
THE MESSAGE IS TO PROTECT 
I THINK IT IS THE MESSAGE 
YOURSELF FROM THE LIFE CONSEQUENCES OF A NIGHT OF SEX IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AS MANY TEENAGERS DO 
AND THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
ELEANOR TEENAGERS 
THAT'S LIKE TRYING TO BANISH TELEVISION IS SEX AMONG TEENAGERS 
YOU CAN'T DO IT 
TEENAGERS WHO CANNOT REMEMBER TO PUT ON THEIR TO TURN IN THEIR HOMEWORK ARE NOT GOING TO USE THESE CONDOMS THAT ARE THROWN AT THEM IN THE SCHOOLS 
WE HAVE TO SET FIRM STANDARDS 
THERE ARE ABSOLUTES OF RIGHT AND WRONG AND THERE IS GOOD AND BAD CHARACTER 
LET'S HELP THE YOUNG PEOPLE FACE UP TO THAT MESSAGE 
I'D SAY LET'S GET AWAY FROM THE CHARACTER ISSUE INITIALLY AND LET'S WORRY ABOUT THE HEALTH PROBLEMS AND THE LIFE CONSEQUENCES 
AND I THINK CONDOMS IS AT LEAST A PLACE TO START 
THEN I WOULD I WOULD TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS 
I STILL THINK IT'S A HIDDEN SUBJECT 
NOT AMONG THE TEENS BUT AMONG THE ELDERS WHO WOULD STILL PREFER THAT IT WAS NINETEEN FIFTY TWO AND EVERYTHING WAS IN THE BACK SEAT OF A CAR 
THEY'RE EDUCATED 
SUZANNE I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH PUTTING THE CHEERLEADERS OFF THE SQUAD EITHER 
BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO STOP THE MANY YOUNG GIRLS AT MANY YOUNG GIRLS AT THAT SCHOOL EVEN FROM BEING SEXUALLY ACTIVE 
THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH 
WE'VE GOT TO FACE UP TO WHERE WE ARE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN AMERICA 
MANY TEENAGERS ARE GOING TO BE SEXUALLY ACTIVE 
NOW IT'S TRUE THAT MORE PROGRAMS ABOUT ABSTINENCE I THINK CAN DISCOURAGE MORE SEXUAL ACTIVITY 
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO DISCOURAGE ALL OF THAT 
WE ARE NOT DOING THESE KIDS ANY FAVORS BY SUGGESTING THAT WE CAN JUST SAY NO AND THE PROBLEM WILL GO AWAY 
WE WOULD BE DOING THEM A FAVOR 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK ON THAT POINT 
I'M SORRY WE'RE OUT OF TIME FOR THIS SEGMENT 
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK THE MATTEL TOY COMPANY'S KEN 
BOYFRIEND JUST A NINETIES KIND OF GUY OR AN OUT OF THE CLOSET GAY
