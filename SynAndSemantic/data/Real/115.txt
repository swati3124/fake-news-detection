IF THERE'S ANYPLACE THAT EPITOMIZES THIS COUNTRY'S CAR CULTURE IT'S LOS ANGELES 
L. A. HAS FIVE HUNDRED TEN MILES OF FREEWAYS MORE THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE COUNTRY BUT L. A. HAS TAKEN A SMALL STEP TOWARD CUTTING DOWN ON BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC 
THIS PAST WEEKEND THE CITY LAUNCHED ITS FIRST MODERN SUBWAY SYSTEM 
THE METRO RED LINE RUNS ONLY FOUR POINT FOUR MILES FROM DOWNTOWN L. A.'S CIVIC CENTER AND FINANCIAL DISTRICT TO MACARTHUR PARK 
BUT TRANSIT OFFICIALS SEE THIS UNDERGROUND LINE AS THE BACKBONE OF WHAT THEY HOPE WILL BE A FOUR HUNDRED MILES SYSTEM THAT SOMEDAY WILL CRISS CROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
FROM LOS ANGELES KITTY REPORTS 
IT'S NOT EVERYDAY THAT SOMETHING TAKEN FOR GRANTED IN MOST MAJOR CITIES OF THE WORLD IS INTRODUCED AS BRAND NEW IN LOS ANGELES 
SO WHEN THE FIRST SLEEK STAINLESS STEEL SUBWAY CARS ARRIVED AT THE PERSHING SQUARE STATION IT WAS GREETED WITH FLASHING RED LIGHTS A PIPED IN BRASS BAND AND A PLATFORM PACKED WITH POLITICIANS 
MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE STOOD IN LONG LINES ALL DAY JUST TO TAKE A PEEK AT THE ITALIAN MADE TRAINS AT THE FLUORESCENT ART ON THE CEILINGS AND THE SPARKLING CLEAN FLOORS AND WALLS 
THERE ARE NO THE RED LINE RELIES ON THE HONOR SYSTEM 
HOWEVER THERE WILL BE RANDOM CHECKS ON TRAINS FOR FARE CARDS 
THERE ARE NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS IN THE STATIONS A DETERRENT TO CRIME NO FOOD KIOSKS A DETERRENT TO LITTER AND NOT EVEN A NEWSSTAND TO BE FOUND UNDERGROUND 
BUT SUBWAY VETERAN PAT WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE WEEKEND OF FREE RIDES GAVE THE RED LINE A DECIDED THUMBS UP 
I'VE RIDDEN SUBWAYS IN PARIS METRO NO PARIS MEXICO CITY NEW YORK MOSCOW 
THIS IS THE BEST 
WHY 
IT'S A LOT SMOOTHER 
YOU CAN'T FEEL THE JOINTS IN THE TRACKS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THE RED LINE IS NOT THE FIRST SUBWAY SYSTEM FOR LOS ANGELES 
FROM NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE UNTIL NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE A SMALL SLIVER OF A SUBWAY LINE JUST UNDER A MILE SERVED AS A BETWEEN ABOVE GROUND TRANSIT IN HOLLYWOOD AND DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES 
BUT FOR AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF L. A. RESIDENTS RIDING THE SUBWAY IS A COMPLETELY NEW EXPERIENCE 
TO HELP THE NOVICE ADAPT TO THIS NEW MODE OF TRANSIT AN INFORMATIONAL VIDEO IS AVAILABLE 
AND PLEASE DON'T LEAN OVER THE EDGE BECAUSE THE TRAINS COME IN FAST AND VERY CLOSE TO THE PLATFORM AND YOU COULD EASILY BE HURT IF YOU GET HIT 
THIS IS NO PLACE TO PLAY AROUND 
SUCH BASIC SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS MAY SEEM SILLY BUT IN A CITY WHERE ONLY ONE IN TWENTY PEOPLE RIDES PUBLIC TRANSIT IT TAKES TIME FOR THOSE USED TO CARS TO ADJUST TO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION 
ALTHOUGH THE ONLY A SEVEN MINUTE RIDE FROM END TO END IT'S PURPOSE IS TO MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND CONNECT WITH EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSIT 
THE RED LINE IS RUNNING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER BUDGET 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH PICKED UP HALF THE BILL FOR THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT HAS LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE FRAUD AND CORRUPTION 
THERE ARE COMPLAINTS THAT THE COMPLETED SYSTEM WON'T TAKE RIDERS TO THE AIRPORT THE ART MUSEUM OR TO DODGERS STADIUM 
AND THERE IS STILL DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE FUTURE LINK TO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SHOULD STAY UNDERGROUND OR BE A LESS COSTLY MONORAIL 
GREG DAVEY IS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE RAPID TRANSIT DISTRICT 
WE SEE DIFFERENT PLANS BEING DISCUSSED EVERYDAY 
IT COULD BE MONORAIL IT COULD BE WHAT WE CALL AT SURFACE RAIL OR A RAIL THAT GOES ALONG STREET LEVEL OR IT COULD BE SUBWAY 
THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN RAGING FOR ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT YEARS NOW AND THERE REALLY IS NO DECISION 
BUT DOWN IN THE TUNNELS UNDERNEATH THE CITY SKYLINE NAGGING CONTROVERSY GIVES WAY TO NOVELTY AS CURIOUS COMMUTERS TRY OUT THE NEWEST THING IN LOS ANGELES IT'S VERY OWN SUBWAY
