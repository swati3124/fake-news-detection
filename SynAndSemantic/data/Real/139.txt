OUR TOP STORY IN EASTERN BOSNIA REPORTS OF PANIC AS THE BESIEGED MUSLIM ENCLAVE OF SREBRENICA APPEARS TO BE ON THE VERGE OF FALLING TO BOSNIAN SERB FORCES 
HAM RADIO REPORTS FROM WITHIN THE AREA SAY SERBS ARE EXPECTED TO CAPTURE SREBRENICA ANY TIME NOW 
THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS THAT MUSLIM DEFENDERS COULD SURRENDER AS EARLY AS NOON ON FRIDAY LOCAL TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SAFE EVACUATION OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND MUSLIM CIVILIANS TRAPPED IN THE ENCLAVE 
A U. N. AID CONVOY LEFT SREBRENICA ON THURSDAY WITH ONLY FIVE ELDERLY WOMEN ABOARD AFTER LOCAL LEADERS BLOCKED A MASS EVACUATION OF REFUGEES 
MEANWHILE NATO PLANES ENFORCING A U. N. NO FLY ZONE OVER BOSNIA TRACKED TWO UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT IN THE ZONE ON THURSDAY BUT COULD NOT INTERCEPT THEM 
THE WAR IN BOSNIA IS TAKING A TERRIBLE TOLL ON THE COUNTRY'S CHILDREN 
SOME WOUNDED CHILDREN WHO WERE EVACUATED FROM SREBRENICA ON TUESDAY ARE RECEIVING MEDICAL CARE IN THE TOWN OF TUZLA 
BUT AS PAUL DAVIES REPORTS SOME OF THEM ARE SCARRED FOR LIFE 
THEY WERE EXPECTING THE WORST THESE MOTHERS FROM SREBRENICA AS THEY ENTERED THE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY'D BEEN TOLD THEIR INJURED CHILDREN HAD BEEN TAKEN 
BROUGHT HER SON WITH HER 
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIS OLDER BROTHER 
SHE'D BEEN TOLD THAT FACE AND HIS TERRIBLE INJURIES HAD BEEN SEEN AROUND THE WORLD BUT SHE HADN'T SEEN HIM SINCE THEY BECAME SEPARATED ON THE CONVOY THAT BROUGHT THEM OUT OF SREBRENICA 
WAS AT BEDSIDE BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF HER PRESENCE 
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HE ASKED HER 
NOT FAR AWAY SHE REPLIED 
IS THERE HE SAID ASKING FOR HIS LITTLE BROTHER FEELING THE BOY'S FACE AND TELLING HIM NOT TO CRY 
AM I HORRIBLE TO LOOK AT HE ASKED HIS MOTHER 
NO SON 
NO SON 
SHE TOLD HIM AS TRIED TO HOLD BACK HIS TEARS 
AND WERE ABLE TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH HELPING HIM EAT AN ORANGE AND TELLING HIM THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE ALL RIGHT 
THEN IT WAS TIME TO GO TO MAKE WAY FOR THE MEDICAL TEAMS 
THE DOCTORS AT TUZLA HOSPITAL HAVE NOW HAD TIME TO MAKE A FULL EXAMINATION OF WOUNDS THE NEWS IS NOT GOOD 
BUT MOTHER WANTED TO KNOW THE TRUTH SHE ASKED TO SEE THE CHIEF SURGEON 
HE TOLD HER THE BLAST FROM A SHELL HAD DESTROYED EYES 
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAVE HE'LL NEVER SEE AGAIN 
AS LEFT THE HOSPITAL I ASKED HER WHAT SHE WOULD TELL 
NOTHING 
I CAN'T TELL HIM HE'S BLIND SHE SAID 
THE DOCTOR TOLD ME I TELL HIM IT'S TOO SOON 
OF COURSE DESPITE THE ATTENTION IT'S RECEIVED SAD STORY IS NOT UNIQUE 
THE MOTHERS WHO ACCOMPANIED TODAY EXPERIENCED THE FULL RANGE OF EMOTIONS 
FOR ONE THE RELIEF OF DISCOVERING A DAUGHTER PRACTICALLY UNSCATHED BUT FOR MOST THE TERRIBLE REALIZATION THAT ANOTHER YOUNG LIFE HAS BEEN SHATTERED DAMAGE NO DOCTOR CAN EVER FULLY REPAIR
