FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE VERDICT A JUROR IN THE LOS ANGELES BEATING TRIAL HAS SPOKEN OUT 
INTERVIEWED ON C. N. N. YESTERDAY SHE SAID SHE DID NOT REGRET THE PANEL'S DECISION 
SHE SAID RACISM WAS NEVER AN ISSUE IN THE TRIAL OR IN THE JURY'S DELIBERATIONS 
AND SHE EXPLAINED HOW THE JURY BELIEVED RODNEY KING HAD CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTER HE WAS STOPPED BY THE POLICE 
HE HAD TWO COMPANIONS IN THE CAR WITH HIM 
AND WHEN HE FINALLY DID STOP AFTER A LONG PURSUIT THE OTHER TWO GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND WERE SEARCHED YOU KNOW AND HANDCUFFED AND PUT INTO VEHICLES TO BE TAKEN FOR WHILE RODNEY KING TENDED TO FROLIC AROUND AND MAKE JOKES APPARENTLY WITH EVERYTHING AND BE VERY COMBATIVE 
AND I FEEL THAT THE POLICE DID ONLY WHAT THEY HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO GET HIM UNDER CONTROL 
WELL THE U. S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T YET CONVINCED OF THAT AND MAY TAKE UP THE RODNEY KING CASE WHERE THE JURY LEFT OFF 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE FOUR L. A. POLICE OFFICERS DENIED KING HIS CIVIL RIGHTS BY USING EXCESSIVE FORCE 
WE GET MORE FROM C. N. N.'S ANTHONY COLLINGS 
THE POLICE BEATING OF RODNEY KING COULD LEAD THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A FEDERAL CASE OUT OF IT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SPEED UP AN INVESTIGATION 
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS WHETHER THERE WAS INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EXCESSIVE FORCE TO CON WHICH MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS 
FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS PROVIDE UP TO TEN YEARS IN PRISON AND A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE FOR CONSPIRACY TO DEPRIVE A PERSON OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS 
ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAYNE BUDD THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S NUMBER THREE OFFICIAL HEADS THE NEW INVESTIGATION 
WITH REGARD TO THE RODNEY KING MATTER THE JURY VERDICT YESTERDAY IS NOT THE LAST STEP 
BUDD AND A TEAM OF PROSECUTORS WILL REVIEW THE STATE TRIAL BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INDICT THE POLICE ON FEDERAL CHARGES 
THE F. B. I. WILL INVESTIGATE AGAIN AS IT DID BEFORE IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE STATE PROSECUTION 
WE HAD CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED OUR PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION 
AT THAT POINT IT WAS STOPPED AND SUBJECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION WE WILL BEGIN AGAIN 
AMONG PRECEDENTS FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PAST WAS THE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR MURDER OF THREE CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS IN MISSISSIPPI 
A SHERIFF AND A DEPUTY WERE CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS 
THE INCIDENT FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE FILM MISSISSIPPI BURNING 
AMONG MORE RECENT CASE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR FOUR HOUSING AUTHORITY POLICE WERE INDICTED ON FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CONSPIRACY CHARGES 
SINCE OCTOBER EIGHTY EIGHTH WE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR POLICE BRUTALITY 
THAT INCLUDES OFFICERS IN I BELIEVE TWENTY THREE JURISDICTIONS 
OUR CONVICTION RATE IS RUNNING APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER POLITICAL PRESSURE TO MOVE FAST IN THE RODNEY KING CASE 
WE DEMAND SOME SWIFT ACTION AND SOME EFFECTIVE ACTION 
MAYOR TOM BRADLEY OF LOS ANGELES PRAISED THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
BUT WHETHER THE NEW LEGAL MOVES WILL BE ENOUGH TO HELP DEFUSE THE SITUATION ON THE STREETS IS STILL FAR FROM CERTAIN
