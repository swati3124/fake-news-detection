THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION IS UNDER FIRE AT ITS MEETING THIS WEEK IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE 
N. R. A. MEMBERSHIP IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH BUT SO ARE QUESTIONS CONCERNING ITS HISTORIC OPPOSITION TO GUN CONTROL IN THE WAKE OF RECENT VIOLENCE NEAR WACO TEXAS 
YET VISIT A FIRING RANGE AND YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MORE PEOPLE LEARNING TO SHOOT MANY ARE WOMEN 
IS THIS A NEW TREND OR A NEW PROFIT CENTER FOR GUN MAKERS 
A LOOK FROM C. N. N.'S LORETTA 
FEAR IS DRIVING MANY WOMEN TO THE FIRING LINE FEAR OF ASSAULT 
YOU'RE AT SOME PLACE DARK AND SOMEBODY IS WALKING TOWARDS YOU AND YOU KNOW IT COULD HAPPEN SO QUICKLY 
AND PRO GUN LOBBIES ARE HELPING WOMEN DEAL WITH THEIR FEARS BY OFFERING THEM INFORMATION ON SELF PROTECTION 
BUT GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES ACCUSE THE FIREARMS INDUSTRY OF MERELY MARKETING FEAR TO WOMEN 
I DON'T WANT TO USE IT BUT IF ANYBODY THREATENED ME OR MY FAMILY I DON'T THINK I'D HESITATE 
AND FOR MANY THAT MEANS PACKING PROTECTION THAT'S EASY TO REACH 
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN DANGER JUST PULL IT RIGHT OUT 
ENROLLMENT FIGURES CONFIRM WOMEN ARE STEPPING UP TO THE FIRING LINE FOR INSTRUCTION BUT THERE'S LITTLE CONCRETE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE PERCEPTION THAT MORE WOMEN ARE BUYING GUNS 
AND OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE PURCHASED FIREARMS MOST SAY IT'S FOR PROTECTION 
THERE AGAIN PERCEPTION AND REALITY MAY NOT MIX 
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION SAYS ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN MILLION WOMEN OWN GUNS AND THE NUMBER IS GROWING 
BUT ONE INDEPENDENT STUDY SHOWS FEMALE HANDGUN OWNERSHIP OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS REMAINED FAIRLY CONSTANT 
BUT MANY WOMEN DON'T PURCHASE THEIR OWN GUNS OR ADMIT OWNING THEM AT ALL 
MY HUSBAND GOT INTO IT FOR A HOBBY MORE OR LESS AND THEN DECIDED THAT HE WAS TRAVELING A LOT AND IT WAS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA THAT I HAD A GUN AT HOME 
AND I'M SOMETIMES OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN MY CAR 
I WORK IN MY CAR 
WHILE CARJACKINGS HAVE GRABBED RECENT HEADLINES GOVERNMENT STATISTICS INDICATE THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE AGAINST WOMEN HAS DECLINED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO 
THEY PULL THEIR GUN OUT AND THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO DO AND THE GUN GETS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM 
SO THAT'S QUITE 
THAT'S WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT RECOMMENDS WOMEN LEARN HOW TO PROPERLY HANDLE THEIR GUNS 
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANYBODY ANNIE OAKLEY IN THREE DAYS 
THE BIGGEST THING THAT I TRY TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD IS GIVE THEM THE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE GUN IF THEY HAVE TO 
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR A GUN BECAUSE IT'S VERY POWERFUL BUT I FEEL LIKE I CAN HANDLE IT NOW
