WE'RE ALL USED TO SEEING THE COMEDIC ANTICS OF WILL SMITH ALSO KNOWN AS THE FRESH PRINCE ON HIS HIT N. B. C. SERIES OF COURSE AND AS A RAPPER IN MUSIC VIDEOS 
BUT SMITH'S LATEST ROLE IN THE NEW MOVIE SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION IS A FAR CRY FROM DELIVERING RAPID FIRE SITCOM OR RECITING LYRICS LIKE BOOM SHAKE THE ROOM 
EVERY MOMENT IN LIFE IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE 
WILL SMITH HAS TAKEN THOSE WORDS TO HEART 
SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION MARKS THE FIRST DRAMATIC MOVIE ROLE FOR THE YOUNG ACTOR AND RAP ARTISTS KNOWN TO MILLIONS OF FANS BY HIS DE PLUME THE FRESH PRINCE 
I WAS SHOOTING FOR THE STARS 
AND YOU KNOW I COULD EITHER GET A LOT OF RESPECT AND PEOPLE JUST SAY WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY 
THIS IS A BRILLIANT DECISION 
BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE A BRILLIANT DECISION YOU HAVE TO SET YOURSELF UP TO LOOK LIKE A FOOL 
SMITH'S TRANSFORMATION IN THE FILM FROM STREET HUSTLER TO HIGH SOCIETY CON ARTIST TOOK THE ACTOR EIGHTEEN WEEKS OF TRAINING WITH A COACH ACTING COACH AND PHYSICAL TRAINER PREPARING HIM MIND AND BODY FOR HIS NEW IDENTITY 
I BORROWED A COPY FROM A YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT SHE HAD UNDERLINED AND I READ THIS BOOK TO FIND OUT WHY THIS TOUCHING BEAUTIFUL SENSITIVE STORY PUBLISHED IN JULY NINETEEN FIFTY ONE HAD TURNED INTO THIS MANIFESTO OF HATE 
DID THAT AFFECT YOU AT ALL WHEN YOU WENT BACK TO WORK ON FRESH PRINCE 
OH ABSOLUTELY 
YOU WALKED IN THERE AND SAID HELLO THERE 
YEAH YOU KNOW UNCLE PHIL WHAT'S UP 
I HAD TO RE LEARN MY COMEDIC INSTINCTS 
I GOT ABOUT SIX SHOWS IN AND WAS LOSING MY MIND IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS WRONG 
AND IT WAS JUST MY FRIENDS WOULD JUST LOOK AT ME AND EVERYTHING WAS LIKE WHY IS WILL TALKING LIKE THAT I BELIEVE THE IMAGINATION IS THE PASSPORT THAT WE CREATE TO HELP TAKE US INTO THE REAL WORLD 
IT WAS INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING IT WAS ARTISTICALLY CHALLENGING AND FROM THOSE THINGS I CAN DERIVE PLEASURE YOU KNOW IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT NEVER WOULD I SAY IT WAS FUN 
IT WAS GRUELING 
SMITH SAYS HE'LL CONTINUE HIS T. V. SERIES FOR AS LONG AS THE FANS WANT TO SEE IT 
HE'S GOT A NEW ALBUM NOW IN STORES BUT HE CALLS MOVIES THE MOST EXCITING ASPECT OF HIS CAREER 
I LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT WITH AIRPLANE PHILOSOPHY 
NOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMPLAINING DO IT ON THE GROUND YOU KNOW 
ONCE THE PLANE TAKES OFF YOU'RE IN THERE 
JUST RELAX
