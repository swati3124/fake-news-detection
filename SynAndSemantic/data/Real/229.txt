FROM A. B. C. THIS IS WORLD NEWS TONIGHT WITH PETER JENNINGS 
GOOD EVENING 
WE BEGIN AGAIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON'S DILEMMA IN SOMALIA AS THE PRESIDENT PUT IT TODAY HOW TO CONCLUDE AMERICA'S MISSION THERE BUT DO IT WITH OF PURPOSE 
TRANSLATION HOW TO GET OUT OF SOMALIA WITHOUT BEING DRIVEN OUT BY THE SOMALI WARLORD GENERAL AIDID 
UNTIL THE PRESIDENT DECIDES HOW TO CONCLUDE THE AMERICAN MISSION THERE WITH OF PURPOSE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS WILL BE GOING THERE 
WE HAVE SEVERAL REPORTS FIRST FROM THE WHITE HOUSE BRIT HUME 
THE PRESIDENT'S SENIOR FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS WERE SUMMONED TO THE WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING FOR MEETINGS WITH MR. CLINTON ON SOMALIA THAT WOULD TAKE UP MUCH OF THE DAY 
BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SPOKE THIS AFTERNOON ALL THAT WAS CLEAR WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF U. S. FORCES 
WE ARE ANXIOUS TO CONCLUDE OUR ROLE THERE HONORABLY BUT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE A REVERSION TO THE ABSOLUTE CHAOS AND THE TERRIBLE MISERY WHICH EXISTED BEFORE 
MR. CLINTON SAID HE WOULD HAVE MORE TO SAY AFTER CONSULTATIONS TOMORROW WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS 
ON CAPITOL HILL THE DRUM BEAT OF CRITICISM OF THE SOMALI MISSION CONTINUED THIS TIME LED BY HOUSE REPUBLICANS SIXTY FIVE OF WHOM SENT THE PRESIDENT A LETTER CALLING HIS SOMALI POLICY A FAILURE AND DEMANDING HE QUOTE EXPEDITIOUSLY WITHDRAW U. S. FORCES 
THUS THE PRESIDENT FINDS HIMSELF CONFRONTED WITH A POLICY CRISIS 
AS RECENTLY AS JUNE MR. CLINTON ALL BUT DECLARED THAT THE U. N. AND U. S. FORCES STILL IN SOMALIA WERE NO LONGER THREATENED BY THE SOMALI WARLORD GENERAL AIDID 
THE UNITED NATIONS ACTING WITH THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER NATIONS HAS CRIPPLED THE FORCES IN MOGADISHU OF WARLORD AIDID AND REMAINS ON GUARD AGAINST FURTHER PROVOCATION 
AIDID OF COURSE HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A CONTINUING MENACE 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY TONIGHT THEY'LL BE PREPARED IN THEIR TALKS WITH CONGRESS TOMORROW TO SET A FIRM DATE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF U. S. TROOPS 
BUT THEY WARN AN ORDERLY EXIT WILL TAKE MONTHS NOT WEEKS
