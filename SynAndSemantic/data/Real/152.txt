I'M DAN RUTZ

CAROLYN ROBINSON REPORTS 
JIM SULLIVAN LOOKS AT LIFE THROUGH ROSE COLORED GLASSES NOW 
HE SEES THINGS QUITE DIFFERENTLY AFTER TWENTY THREE YEARS OF FROM A STROBE EFFECT 
IF SOMEONE TOSSED ME SOMETHING I MIGHT SEE IT TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM ME AND MY NEXT VISION OF IT WOULD BE RIGHT IN MY FACE 
THAT'S BECAUSE LIGHT OF ALMOST ANY KIND BLINDS HIM 
HE HAS A RARE INHERITED EYE CONDITION CALLED ROD 
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME NOT JUST A SIMPLE BUT A POWERFUL WHERE WHERE IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE OUT IN THE SUNLIGHT FOR A LENGTH OF TIME 
IT'S LIKE SNOW WHITE OUT 
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A SNOWSTORM IF THEY OPEN THEIR EYES AT ALL 
WHICH MADE A LOT OF DAILY ACTIVITIES DIFFICULT LIKE TRANSPORTATION 
IT WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM UNTIL DOCTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY FITTED SULLIVAN WITH LENSES A SPECIFIC SHADE OF RED 
NOW HE FEELS SAFE ENOUGH TO RIDE HIS BIKE AGAIN 
I TELL YOU BEING ABLE TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT OBJECTS AND OTHER MOVING OBJECTS FROM A DISTANCE BEING ABLE TO READ STREET SIGNS BEING ABLE TO SEE TRAFFIC LIGHTS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC 
I'M STILL AMAZED THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE TRAFFIC LIGHTS IN THE SUNLIGHT 
EYES LACK IMPORTANT STRUCTURES CALLED CONES 
CONES ARE THE RECEPTORS THAT YOU USE FOR DAYLIGHT VISION 
THEY ARE THE ONES THAT PROVIDE YOU WITH DETAIL VISION AND COLOR VISION 
RODS ARE ANOTHER TYPE OF VISION RECEPTOR 
THESE ACTIVATE YOUR LOW LIGHT SITUATIONS BUT THEY DON'T PICK UP COLORS WHICH IS WHY WE SEE ONLY SHADES OF GRAY AT NIGHT AND NIGHT IS THE ONLY TIME SULLIVAN AND OTHERS LIKE HIM CAN SEE ANYTHING WELL SINCE RODS ARE THE ONLY VISION RECEPTORS THEY HAVE 
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH LIGHT PROTECTION SO THAT THEY CAN SEE AS WELL AS THEY CAN UNDER DARK CONDITIONS AND THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS BY PUTTING RED LENSES ON THEM 
RED LENSES WILL TRICK THE ROD STRUCTURES INTO FUNCTIONING AS IF IT IS NIGHT 
TYPICAL SUNGLASSES WON'T WORK 
I DID HAVE SOME GLASSES AS A YOUNGSTER SOME GREEN SUNGLASSES WHICH I WORE OCCASIONALLY AND BROKE VERY OFTEN SO I DIDN'T WEAR THEM TOO MUCH 
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP MUCH 
THEY WERE PROTECTION BUT NOT THE PROTECTION THAT THE RED LENSES GIVE 
FAMILY SPENT ABOUT TWO YEARS TAKING HIM AROUND TO DOCTORS BEFORE ONE DIAGNOSED HIM PROPERLY AND THAT'S A COMMON STORY 
MOST EYE PRACTITIONERS AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH ROD SINCE IT ONLY OCCURS TO ONE IN ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT HARD TO DIAGNOSE EVEN IN INFANTS 
THERE'S A SORT OF DIAGNOSTIC TEST TO DO IS TO TAKE THE CHILD OUTSIDE AND PUT RED LENSES IN FRONT OF THEM 
IF THE CHILD OPENS HIS EYES WITH RED LENSES ON THAT'S ALMOST CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS CONDITION 
OTHER COMMON CHARACTERISTICS RAPID BACK AND FORTH EYE MOVEMENT AND EXTREMELY WEAK OVERALL VISION 
STRESSES IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET CHILDREN DIAGNOSED AND FITTED WITH CORRECTIVE LENSES EARLY SO DEVELOPMENT ISN'T SLOWED BY THEIR PROBLEMS WITH LIGHT 
CAN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES NOW 
SURE 
SULLIVAN REMEMBERS WHAT A CHANGE IT WAS WHEN DOCTOR FIRST FITTED HIM WITH RED LENSES 
BUT TO BE ABLE TO SEE LEAVES AND BRANCHES AND THEN ALWAYS KNOWING THAT THEY WERE THERE BUT BEING ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THEM FROM A DIFFERENCE WAS SOMETHING QUITE NEW AS WELL AS THE BIRDS AND DEFINITION PERIMETERS OF OBJECTS WERE SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES ALIVE WITH THESE GLASSES 
PRIOR TO WEARING THESE THINGS JUST BLENDED INTO EACH OTHER 
A WHOLE NEW WORLD HAS LITERALLY OPENED UP BEFORE HIS EYES 
THE GREATEST CHANGE THAT THIS HAS BEEN FOR ME I WOULD SAY IS THAT THINGS SEEM LIMITLESS NOW AND BEFORE THEY SEEMED VERY LIMITED
