AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE HOUSE VOTED THIS AFTERNOON TO DELAY RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS SURROUNDING THE POST OFFICE SCANDAL 
THE DEBATE AND THE HEAT SURROUNDING THE SCANDAL HAS TAKEN A DISTINCTLY PARTISAN TONE 
WE GO NOW TO CAPITOL HILL AND C. N. N.'S BOB FRANKEN FOR THE LATEST ON THIS DEBATE THIS AFTERNOON 
BOB 
WE KNOW OF COURSE BOB ALL OF THIS REVOLVES THE IMPLICATION AND ALL THIS NOW OF HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN DAN ROSTENKOWSKI WHO INSISTS TO CONTINUE ON BRUSHING ASIDE ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT HE'S HAVING INSISTS ON BEING SEEN AS A KEY PLAY IN THE DEFICIT NEGOTIATIONS 
BUT ON THE HOUSE FLOOR REPUBLICANS WERE ACCUSING DEMOCRATIC LEADERS OF COVER UP FOR RESISTING REPUBLICAN DEMANDS TO RELEASE RECORDS OF AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE HOUSE POST OFFICE ONE CHARGING THAT A LETTER FROM THE U. S. ATTORNEY OPPOSING PUBLIC DISCLOSURE CAME ABOUT BECAUSE HOUSE SPEAKER FOLEY INTERCEDED 
THAT THE LETTER FROM THE U. S. ATTORNEY CAME AFTER A PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ASKING PLEASE DON'T LET THIS GO FORWARD 
WHAT FOLLOWED IS WHAT THE NOVELISTS LIKE TO CALL HIGH DRAMA 
THAT IS TOTALLY AND ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT 
IF THE GENTLEMAN WHO CONTROLS THE TIME WOULD YIELD TO ME 
I MUST TELL THE GENTLEMAN THAT I AM SURPRISED THAT THE NORMAL COURTESY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN MEMBERS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN THIS CASE TO ME AS SPEAKER 
AT NO TIME WAS THERE EVER ANY INQUIRY FROM ANY MEMBER OF YOUR LEADERSHIP OR ANY MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE HOUSE AS TO WHETHER I HAD HAD ANY SUCH CONVERSATION 
THE REPUBLICAN EFFORT FAILED 
MEANWHILE NO COMMENT FROM ROSTENKOWSKI ON A CHICAGO SUN TIMES REPORT THAT HIS LAWYERS HAD UNSUCCESSFULLY CONTACTED LOW LEVEL JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES SEEKING A DELAY IN A MONDAY HEARING AT WHICH FORMER HOUSE POSTMASTER ROBERT PLEADED GUILTY TO EMBEZZLEMENT AND IMPLICATED ROSTENKOWSKI 
BACK AT THE BUDGET NEGOTIATION QUESTIONS PERSISTED ABOUT ROSTENKOWSKI'S ABILITY TO PLAY A KEY ROLE 
THE VERY FACT THAT REPORTER QUESTIONS PERSIST SORTS OF PROVES THAT THE LEGAL CLOUDS ARE STILL FLYING OVER THE DEFICIT BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS 
AND CLEARLY FRANK DEMOCRATIC LEADERS ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE 
BOB AN IMPORTANT QUESTION DESPITE THE PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF CONFIDENCE AND LOOKING UPWARD AND SEEING NO CLOUDS HOW WORRIED ARE THEY 
HOW WORRIED IS MOYNIHAN 
HOW WORRIED ARE THEY IN ROSTENKOWSKI'S OFFICE AND CIRCLE THAT THIS THING IS QUITE SERIOUS AND JEOPARDIZES HIS CAREER 
WELL THEY'RE OF COURSE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS 
THE LAWYER HAS GIVEN THEM STRICT ORDERS NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT 
BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE DISTRACTED 
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WILL CONTINUE TO SAY PUBLICLY THAT THEY ARE IN FACT NOT DISTRACTED BY ALL THIS BUT OTHERS WILL SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM NOT TO BE 
SO THAT WE CAN SAY THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN WHOLLY DISTRACTED BY IT BOB WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS TODAY 
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS 
SOME PROGRESS 
THEY'VE AGREED ON SOME OF THE TAXES FOR UPPER INCOME PEOPLE THEY'VE AGREED FOR INSTANCE THAT THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THOSE THE RETROACTIVE DATE WOULD BE MARCH FIRST 
THAT'S A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE 
AND THEY'VE COME TO SOME AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES 
WHAT'S INTERESTING OF COURSE IS THAT ALL OF THIS HAS BECOME SORT OF A BY THE WAY MATTER 
SO FAR NO SURPRISES
