SOME PEOPLE EXPECTED THE GOVERNMENT TO THROW THE BOOK AT SALOMON BROTHERS BUT MYRON KANDEL SAYS IF IT WEREN'T FOR WARREN THEY JUST MIGHT HAVE DONE JUST THAT 
WELL TWO HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF BOOK THOUGH MYRON 
YES BUT I THINK IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE PENALTY LOU 
AND THE FACT IS IF THERE WERE SUCH A THING AS A CORPORATE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR RESCUING AN ENDANGERED COMPANY FROM THE BRINK OF DISASTER THEY SHOULD BE PINNING IT ON WARREN RIGHT NOW 
HIS SQUEAKY CLEAN IMAGE HIS REPUTATION AS AN ICON OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM AND HIS UNMATCHED WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS KEPT SALOMON FROM POTENTIAL DESTRUCTION 
WHEN THE SCANDAL BROKE LAST SUMMER STEPPED IN TO HEAD THE FIRM AND TO PROTECT HIS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT 
AT THAT POINT THE TREASURY HAD DECIDED TO BAN THE FIRM FROM DEALING IN THE GOVERNMENT'S SECURITIES MARKET 
BUT WAS ABLE TO GET TREASURY SECRETARY NICHOLAS BRADY ON THE PHONE AND CONVINCE HIM TO LIFT AT LEAST PART OF THAT SANCTION 
HE ALSO MOVED SWIFTLY TO GET RID OF THE OFFENDING SALOMON OFFICIALS 
CONTRAST ALL THAT WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S UNRELENTING PURSUIT OF DREXEL BURNHAM WHICH EVENTUALLY RESULTED IN THAT FIRM'S DEMISE AND THE LOSS OF NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS 
DREXEL WAS THE QUINTESSENTIAL NON ESTABLISHMENT FIRM HAVING THUMBED ITS NOSE FOR YEARS AT BOTH WASHINGTON AND WALL STREET 
AND WHEN IT NEEDED FRIENDS IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
THE KEY ELEMENT OF TODAY'S SETTLEMENT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION NOT TO FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST SALOMON WHICH I AGREE WITH 
TRANSGRESSIONS THOUGH VERY GRAVE WERE NOT SYSTEMIC 
AND UNLIKE DREXEL ACTED QUICKLY TO END THEM 
THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY IS APPROPRIATE 
IT WILL HURT BUT IT WON'T COST SALOMON SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THEIR JOBS 
LOU 
WELL MYRON I THINK YOU MAKE EXCELLENT POINTS 
I ASKED THE S. E. C. CHAIRMAN RICHARD IF DREXEL HAD BEEN SOMETHING OF AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE REGULATORS HE DECLINED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL I THINK THAT LOU THEY WERE THE FACT THAT DREXEL WENT OUT OF BUSINESS IS TOO BAD 
THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS TOUGH ON THEM WAS RIGHT AS IT NOW TURNED OUT 
I THINK THEY COULD'VE SAVED THAT FIRM AND THOSE JOBS 
TEN THOUSAND JOB 
LET ME ASK YOU DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S SECURITIES MARKET IS ALL UP AND WE'RE READY TO MOVE AHEAD ETHICS ALL STRAIGHTENED UP LEGAL ISSUES RESOLVED 
I THINK IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE NOW 
OKAY MYRON
