WILL THE DEMOCRATS BE ABLE TO PULL ALL THEIR FACTIONS TOGETHER AND AGREE ON THE FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE 
WILL IT HELP THE ECONOMY OR AS THE REPUBLICANS CLAIM HURT IT 
SLOGANS ARE EASY TAX AND SPEND CUT SPENDING FIRST IT'S SPENDING STUPID THEY ALL SOUND SO GOOD SO THAT THEY MASK THE REALITY 
ARE THE REPUBLICANS INDEED HIDING THEIR BUDGET SHORTCOMINGS IN RHETORICAL THOUGHT 
FROM WASHINGTON THIS IS NEWSMAKER SUNDAY WITH FRANK SESNO 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM 
I'M BOB FRANKEN IN FOR FRANK SESNO 
OUR GUESTS TODAY DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY ROGER ALTMAN AND LATER SENATE MINORITY LEADER ROBERT DOLE 
JOINING ME WITH THE QUESTIONS IS C. N. N.'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JILL DOUGHERTY 
MR. ALTMAN LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR JOB WHICH IS TO RUN IT'S BEEN CALLED TO RUN THE BOILER ROOM IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION TO RAM THIS THROUGH CONGRESS IF YOU'LL ACCEPT THAT CHARACTERIZATION AND IT'S GOING TO BE THROUGH THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS SINCE THE REPUBLICANS HAVE OPTED OUT AS YOU KNOW 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE NEVER ACCUSED OF BEING AN ORGANIZED POLITICAL PARTY AND THAT'S BECOMING EVIDENT RIGHT HERE 
YOU HAVE THE LIBERALS WHO ARE SAYING THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE MADE IN THIS AND THE CONSERVATIVES SAYING ACCEPT THEM OR ELSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO PASS THIS 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PULL ALL THESE GROUPS TOGETHER 
WELL FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE OUTLOOK IS QUITE GOOD 
AFTER ALL EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S ORIGINAL BUDGET IS ALREADY IN THE HOUSE VERSION AND IN THE SENATE VERSION AND WE'RE WITHIN ABOUT TWO WEEKS OF COMPLETING THIS AND THAT WOULD BE THE FASTEST ENACTMENT OF A MAJOR ECONOMIC PLAN IN MODERN HISTORY 
THE VOTES WERE CLOSE AS YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY SIX VOTES IN THE HOUSE AND A TIE BREAKING VOTE IN THE SENATE BUT I THINK WE'LL GET THERE AND THE REASON WE'LL GET THERE IS THAT THIS PLAN ALREADY IS WORKING 
YOU KNOW WHEN THE PROSPECT OF CREDIBLE DEFICIT REDUCTION FROM PRESIDENT CLINTON CAME INTO VIEW INTEREST RATES BEGAN TO FALL DRAMATICALLY THAT PICKED UP CERTAIN CREDIT SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES LIKE AUTOS CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING AND WHAT'S GOING ON 
JOBS ARE BEING CREATED 
WE'RE CREATING JOBS OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND A MONTH 
THAT'S THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE RATE AT WHICH PRESIDENT BUSH DID OVER FOUR YEARS 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE BUT LET ME GET BACK TO THE NO WAY FACTOR 
YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE FROM THE WESTERN STATES FOR INSTANCE AND YOU HAVE OTHERS WHO ARE SAYING NO WAY WILL I VOTE FOR A BILL THAT HAS THE INCREASE IN THE ENERGY TAX THAT SEEMS TO BE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE LIBERALS WHO ARE SAYING NO WAY WILL I VOTE FOR A PACKAGE THAT MAKES THE KINDS OF CUTS IN THE LIBERAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED 
THE NO WAY FACTOR WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE A PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY HAS DUG HIMSELF INTO THE SAND 
THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY I THINK IT'LL PREVAIL 
THE FIRST IS THAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS MUCH WORSE 
THERE'S NO CREDIBLE REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE 
I HOPE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT 
SO THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO DO NOTHING AND TO DO NOTHING IN OTHER WORDS TO FAIL AND NOT PASS A NEW BUDGET WOULD MEAN THAT INTEREST RATES WOULD GO BACK UP SHARPLY 
THAT'S USUALLY BAD FOR STOCK PRICES 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WOULD TAKE A HIT 
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE WOULD TAKE A HIT AND THIS RATE OF JOB CREATION THAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT WOULD START TO UNRAVEL 
I DON'T THINK IN THE END THAT THE CONGRESS IS GOING TO WANT TO EMBRACE THAT 
THE SECOND REASON I THINK THAT WILL PREVAIL IS THAT THE VOTERS SENT A STRONG MESSAGE LAST NOVEMBER TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY WANT AN END TO GRIDLOCK AND IT'S TRUE THAT THE DEMOCRATS OF COURSE NOW CONTROL THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE DEMOCRATS WANT TO GO TO THE VOTES IN NOVEMBER NINETY FOURTH AND SAY WE JUST COULDN'T GET IT DONE 
JILL 
ONE CRUCIAL ELEMENT HERE IS WHAT THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT WILL BE IN ACTUALLY PUSHING FOR HIS PLAN AND HE WENT UP TO THE HILL THIS WEEK HAD A RIP ROARING SPEECH I GUESS IT WAS ON TUESDAY RALLYING THE TROOPS 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SEE NOW FROM THE PRESIDENT IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT HE TELLS CONGRESS SPECIFICALLY 
IS HE GOING TO TELL PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE WANTS TO DO OR IS HE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT PRINCIPLES 
WELL I THINK THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS TO THAT JILL 
THE FIRST IS THAT THE CONFERENCE IS WORKING IT'S MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS 
WITHIN ANOTHER WEEK OR SO IT SHOULD BE FINISHED AND EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE DETAILS OF THE FINAL AGREEMENT ARE 
AND OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRESENT IN A LOT OF THOSE DELIBERATIONS AND OUR VIEWS ARE BEING SOUGHT TOO 
SECOND OF ALL THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS AS HIS TOP PRIORITY BETWEEN NOW AND THE END 
THE STAKES ARE ENORMOUS 
THIS IS THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC CHANGE AND BIG CHANGE THAT THE VOTERS ASKED FOR LAST FALL AND HE'S GOING TO BE SPENDING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME TALKING WITH LEGISLATORS 
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A SPEECH TO THAT NATION AT AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT AND JUST WORKING ON THIS NON STOP BETWEEN NOW AND THEN AND THE ENACTMENT 
LOOK YOU MAKE THE POINT AND IT'S A POINT THAT'S BEING MADE BY EVERY DEMOCRAT RIGHT NOW WHO'S TRYING TO GET THIS PASSED THAT IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE ECONOMY IF THIS WAS NOT TO PASS BUT THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE BUDGET AGREEMENT OF NINETEEN NINETY WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO MANY THAT THE ECONOMY IS SUBJECT TO ANY NUMBER OF PRESSURES 
YOU HAVE FOR INSTANCE ALAN GREENSPAN THE FED CHAIRMAN UP THERE THIS WEEK TALKING ABOUT INCREASING INTEREST RATES NOTWITHSTANDING A DEFICIT REDUCTION DEAL 
AREN'T YOU THIS 
I DON'T THINK SO 
FIRST OF ALL CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN SAID WE NEED THIS FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFICIT REDUCTION AND IF WE DON'T GET IT THE IMPACT ON INTEREST RATES AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE NEGATIVE 
THAT WAS A VERY SUPPORTING COMMENT 
WELL NOBODY IS ARGUING THAT DEFICIT REDUCTION WOULD BE BAD 
IT SEEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS THE EFFECTS OF THIS GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE ECONOMY 
WELL I THINK WE'RE JUST TELLING IT LIKE IT IS THAT THE REALITY IS THAT JOB GROWTH IS PICKING UP 
WE'VE RELEASED AN ANALYSIS TO THE EFFECT THAT UNDER THIS PLAN WE THINK WE'LL CREATE EIGHT MILLION JOBS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS 
WE EVEN RELEASED IT ON A STATE BY STATE BASIS 
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE JUST HAPPENED TO BRING IT WITH ME 
HAPPENED TO BRING YOUR PROP YES 
AND BREAKS DOWN BY EACH STATE WHERE WE THINK THE JOBS WILL COME FROM 
EITHER WAY MOST LEADING PRIVATE FORECASTERS AGREE WITH THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE AMOUNTS OF JOBS WHICH WILL BE CREATED 
SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE IT 
THIS IS THE TYPE OF BIG CHANGE THAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY AND IMPORTANT FOR JOBS AND GROWTH THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ASKED FOR LAST NOVEMBER 
SPEAKING OF THE EIGHT MILLION JOBS 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THOSE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OVERALL PROJECTIONS FOR WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE NOT NECESSARILY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN 
IS THAT CORRECT 
THEY'RE BASED ON A SERIES OF YES OF LONG TERM TRENDS TOGETHER WITH THE PLAN 
I AGREE IT'S NOT THE PLAN ALL BY ITSELF 
IT'S THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK INCORPORATING THE PLAN 
BUT I WOULD REPEAT YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE AND AS I SAID THERE IS NO REAL REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE 
THEY STRUCK OUT IN TERMS OF OFFERING A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE AND IF THIS ISN'T VOTED YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A SERIES OF BAD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AS I MENTIONED INCLUDING GOING BACK DOWN ON THIS JOB GROWTH RATE 
IN THE POLITICAL SENSE THOUGH WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PIN YOURSELF DOWN TO EIGHT MILLION JOBS 
I MEAN A YEAR OR TWO FROM NOW SOMEBODY CAN PULL UP THE SLASH AND SAY THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS AND SAY HEY WHERE ARE THOSE JOBS 
WELL NOBODY CAN GUARANTEE AS YOU SAY THAT THOSE JOBS WILL COME TO PASS BUT IT IS OUR BEST JUDGMENT THAT THEY'LL BE CREATED AS I SAID MOST OF THE LEADING PRIVATE FORECASTERS AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT AND WE'RE JUST TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THE PLAN WILL DO 
O. K. BUT LET'S TAKE THE REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT FOR A SECOND AND TREAT IT 
THE REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY THAT ANY MONEY THAT YOU TAX IS MONEY TAKEN OUT OF AN ECONOMY THAT CAN BE SPENT TO CREATE JOBS BY GIVING CONSUMERS THE POWER TO BUY 
AND THEY SAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TOO PRONE TO TAX AND UNDERMINE THE ECONOMY BY TAXING IT TO DEATH AND THEY MAKE THE POINT ALSO THAT THIS PLAN DOES JUST THAT 
WELL LET ME MAKE TWO OR THREE POINTS ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN ARGUMENTS 
FIRST OF ALL AS TO WHETHER THIS PLAN IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY WHICH IS A MAIN ARGUMENT THEY ARE MAKING I REFER YOU TO A BUNCH OF THE LEADING ECONOMIC FORECASTERS WHO BUILT THIS PLAN INTO THEIR MODELS AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WILL BE POSITIVE FOR THE ECONOMY POSITIVE FOR GROWTH AND POSITIVE FOR JOBS 
BUT THEY'RE SAYING EXCUSE ME THEY ARE SAYING THAT DEFICIT REDUCTION WOULD BE POSITIVE 
THE ARGUMENT HOWEVER IS THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS THAN TAKING TAXES 
WELL BUT THAT GETS TO THE SECOND POINT 
WHAT IS IT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PROPOSED 
SENATOR DOLE WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT 
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SENATE VOTED ON THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET THE NIGHT BEFORE REPUBLICANS THREW TOGETHER AN ALTERNATIVE AND WHAT WAS IN IT 
ONE HUNDRED BILLION LESS DEFICIT REDUCTION AND WITHIN THAT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OF CUTS TO BE FIGURED OUT LATER 
IT WASN'T A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE 
IT WAS AN AIR BALL AND MOST OF THE PRESS IN FACT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PRESS IT 
BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT OF THE QUESTION 
IN THE BRIEF TIME THAT WE HAVE LEFT DOESN'T TAXING INHERENTLY HURT THE ECONOMY BY TAKING MONEY OUT OF IT 
NO BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF THIS OVERALL PLAN THE WHOLE PLAN ON THE ECONOMY WILL BE POSITIVE 
BUT LET JUST MAKE ONE POINT ABOUT WHO PAYS THE TAXES 
UNDER THE SENATE BILL EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE NEW TAXES WILL BE PAID BY AMERICANS EARNING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
MOST WORKING AMERICAN FAMILIES SAY EARNING FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL PAY ABOUT A DOLLAR A WEEK FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR 
WE THINK THAT'S A FAIR APPROACH 
DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTY'S THE UPPER TAXPAYERS HAD THEIR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES GO DOWN 
THAT REALLY WASN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT AND SO WE THINK THE WHOLE PLAN IT'S THE WAY YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT WILL BE POSITIVE FOR JOBS 
ROGER ALTMAN DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY THE MAN WHO IS RUNNING THE BOILER ROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING TO SELL THIS PROGRAM THROUGH CONGRESS AMONG THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
IN A MOMENT WE'LL BE JOINED BY THE SENATOR REPUBLICAN LEADER ROBERT DOLE 
CLINTON'S TRYING TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING 
YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT COMPROMISING AND I DON'T THINK IT'S WAVERING 
I THINK IT'S ATTEMPTING TO GET THE JOB DONE 
HE'S GOT TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF CONGRESS 
HE CAMPAIGNED ON UNLOCKING THE GRIDLOCK BUT HE HASN'T BEEN TOO SUCCESSFUL ON THAT NOT BECAUSE HE HASN'T TRIED 
THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE GUYS UP THAT ON THE HILL DON'T WANT TO COOPERATE 
AMONG THOSE WHO HAS NOT BEEN EXACTLY COOPERATING WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON THESE DAYS WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET DEFICIT IS OUR NEXT GUEST SENATOR ROBERT DOLE MINORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE PROMINENT CRITIC OF THE BUDGET PLAN 
THE CRITICISM OF YOUR CRITICISM IS THAT THE PLANS THAT YOU'RE OFFERING DO NOT IN FACT SPECIFICALLY OFFER ANY CUTS 
RHETORICAL FOG I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT CALLED THEM 
YEAH WELL I DOUBT THE PRESIDENT EVEN LOOKED AT OUR PLAN WOULD BE MY GUESS 
HE PROBABLY JUST READ SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY GAVE HIM AND YOU'RE LAST GUEST MAY NOT HAVE LOOKED AT OUR PLAN EITHER MR. ALTMAN BECAUSE I BROUGHT A LITTLE CHART ALONG 
UNDER OUR PLAN THE DEFICIT ACTUALLY CONTINUES TO GO DOWN AND THEIRS COMES STARTING BACK UP IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS CALLED YOUR PLAN 
THEY SAY THAT YOUR PLAN IS A MYTH THAT THERE ARE NOT SPECIFIC SPENDING CUTS AND THEY'RE JUST GENERAL AREAS WHERE YOU 
WELL IF THAT'S THE CASE WE TOOK EVERY SPENDING CUT THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON SUGGESTED TWO HUNDRED AND SOME SPENDING CUTS WE PUT IN OUR PACKAGE 
WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR FIVE YEAR FREEZE ON SO CALLED DISCRETIONARY SPENDING NON DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND WE HAVE CAPS ON ENTITLEMENTS STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
WE NEED SOME TIME FOR THE PHASE IN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT TAXES 
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE UP THE LACK OF TAXES THAT YOU WOULDN'T PUT IN YOURS SO THE CRITICS SAY YOU WOULD NEED TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT OTHER SPENDING CUTS WHICH YOU HAVE NOT BEEN IN YOUR PLAN 
WELL THEY HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T SPECIFIED WHERE THEY ARE 
WE THINK WE WERE SPECIFIC 
WE THINK IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH VOTE 
WE PICKED UP A COUPLE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTES ON IT AND I HEAR THE PRESIDENT OUT SAYING HE'S GOING TO CREATE EIGHT MILLION NEW JOBS 
THE C. B. O. SAID IN JANUARY IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING YOU'D CREATE NINE POINT FOUR MILLION NEW JOBS SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE LOSING ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF JOBS WITH THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN 
JILL 
ARE YOU WORRIED 
I SAW A CARTOON THE OTHER DAY WHERE YOU WERE DEPICTED AS DARTH VADER I THINK AS DARTH BROTHER MAYBE BUT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT YOUR STRATEGY OF SAYING NO TO THE PRESIDENT 
NOT ON THE ECONOMIC PLAN 
NO I THINK IF WE DID IT ON EVERY PIECE OF LEGISLATION THERE'D BE SAY WELL WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE UP TO BUT WE'RE ALREADY OUT FRONT ON THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT ON THE RUSSIAN RECONSTRUCTION PLAN A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WILL PROBABLY FURNISH MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES THAN DEMOCRATS 
WE'RE NOT FOR THE BIG SPENDING BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR NOW TEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR NATIONAL SERVICE 
WE THINK IT SORT OF UNDERSCORES THE TAX AND SPEND OF THIS ADMINISTRATION 
THEY'VE GOT A TAX BILL IN CONGRESS 
CONFERENCE AND A SPENDING BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND NO WAY TO PAY FOR IT 
BUT NO WE'RE GOING TO COOPERATE AND WE'VE WRITTEN THE PRESIDENT 
WE'VE SET DOWN IN FACT WE'LL WORK OUT A DEFICIT PACKAGE IF THIS FAILS 
MANY REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO DO THAT 
WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT THOUGH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED 
IN THE EVENT THAT IT DOESN'T PASS IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER VERSION OF THE ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE SUMMIT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND JUST VERY QUICKLY TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT MEANT THAT THE PARTY LEADERS GOT TOGETHER FROM BOTH PARTIES AND WORKED OUT SOMETHING 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HAPPEN 
WELL I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PRESIDENT 
CERTAINLY THAT AN ISSUE BUT I THINK IT COULD DEPEND ON THE PRESIDENT 
CERTAINLY HE'D HAVE TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE BUT WE'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT 
WE'VE GOT SOME PRETTY GOOD IDEAS ON RETROACTIVE INDEXING OF CAPITAL GAINS TO MAKE IT RETROACTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE 
DO SOME OTHER THINGS THAT MAY ATTRACT EVEN SOME MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS 
SO ARE YOU WAITING ARE YOU WAITING THEN TO HAVE THE DEMOCRATS FAIL AND THEN FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO COME TO THEIR RESCUE 
WELL I DON'T SEE IT QUITE THAT WAY 
I REMEMBER IN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN ONLY ONE DEMOCRAT VOTED FOR OUR PACKAGE WE WERE PRETTY UPSET ABOUT LACK OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 
AS IT ENDED UP THAT YEAR WE DIDN'T GET A RECONCILIATION PACKAGE BUT I JUST SAY WE'RE PREPARED TO HELP THE PRESIDENT 
WE'VE WRITTEN HIM A LETTER MYSELF AND SENATOR DOMENICI SENATOR PACKWOOD 
I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY 
I UNDERSTAND THAT SENATOR BOREN MAY HAVE TOLD HIM YESTERDAY THAT A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO SET DOWN SO OUR POINT IS THAT WE'RE NOT PLAYERS NOT BY CHOICE 
WE'RE THE MINORITY PARTY BUT WE ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE SOME HELP AND SOME NEW IDEAS 
IF WE COULD GET BACK TO SPECIFICS AGAIN SOME OF THE SOCIAL SPENDING ISSUES THAT ARE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE BLACK CAUCUS WHAT WOULD YOU DO 
WHAT DOES YOUR PLAN SPECIFICALLY GET INTO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CUTS 
WELL OUR PLAN IS NOT THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE VOTED ON BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THEY PUT IN A LOT OF THESE SOCIAL SPENDING ISSUES TO OFFSET THE COST OF THE B. T. U. TAX 
WELL THE B. T. U. TAX IS DEAD SO I THINK I AGREE WITH SECRETARY BENTSEN WHO SAID THIS MORNING ON ANOTHER SHOW THAT YOU MAY NOT GET THE FULL WHATEVER IT IS TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS ARE GONE BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT 
WE SHARE THAT VIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT WE WOULDN'T DO IT THIS WAY 
WE WENT THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE IN NINETEEN NINETY AND MANY OF US WALKED THE PLANK AND DIDN'T GET MUCH FOR IT 
THIS IS NOT A FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN IT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS 
BUT AGAIN WHERE ARE THE SPECIFICS 
OUR SPECIFICS 
ALL RIGHT LET'S SAY THE SOCIAL SPENDING ISSUES 
THE SOCIAL SPENDING ISSUES WE TRY TO PROTECT LOW INCOME PROGRAMS MEDICAID W. I. C. FOOD STAMPS 
WE DON'T INCREASE SPENDING IN ANY PROGRAM 
LET'S TALK ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT IS RELATED AND THAT OF COURSE IS THE FLOODS OUT IN THE MIDWEST 
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THERE 
YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM THERE 
THERE WAS A POLITICAL FIGHT ABOUT THAT THIS WEEK MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PASS THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FLOOD AID THAT IS NEEDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS PLUS NOW THEY'RE ESTIMATING 
THE ISSUES SEEM TO BE THERE SEEM TO BE TWO ISSUES ONE HAVING TO DO WITH THE MEASURE ABOUT URBAN JOBS BUT LET'S FORGET THAT FOR THE MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN CLAIM MAINLY REPUBLICAN THAT YOU SHOULD FIND CUTS ELSEWHERE IN THE GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF RELYING ON EMERGENCY SPENDING 
WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON THAT 
WELL MY VIEW IS THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY LIKE HURRICANE ANDREW WAS HURRICANE HUGO THE EARTHQUAKES IN SAN FRANCISCO HURRICANES IN HAWAII AND THE LAW PROVIDES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO OFFSET TRUE EMERGENCIES 
NOW WE DON'T WANT TO LOAD IT UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS WE NEED TO KEEP THE SO CALLED PORK OUT OF IT BUT ON THE EMERGENCY DISASTER ITSELF I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS AN OFFSET 
WE NEED TO WORK ON A PLAN THAT WILL DO THAT IN FUTURE YEARS 
AND SO YOU CONTRADICT THE POSITION OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP THAT THERE SHOULD BE THESE OFFSETS 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE LEADERSHIP POSITION BUT I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IN THIS VIEW 
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY AND IT'S PROVIDED FOR BY LAW 
NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT POLICY MAYBE NEXT YEAR BUT HOW DO YOU DO IT NOW 
MANY OF THE APPROPRIATION BILLS HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE HOUSE 
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO GO BACK AND SAY LET'S TAKE ONE PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD 
SO MAYBE AT AN EARLIER TIME THIS YEAR I MIGHT'VE SAID YES BUT I THINK NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THE AID THERE BUT LET'S MAKE CERTAIN IT GOES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DEVASTATED AND DAMAGE NOT MAKE IT A BIG YOU KNOW A BIG CHRISTMAS TREE 
HAVING BEEN OUT THERE DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE COMING OUT NOW TEN BILLION DOLLARS 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY HARD TO PUT A DOLLAR FIGURE ON IT NOW BECAUSE UNTIL THE WATER RECEDES IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE BUT IT'S SUBSTANTIAL 
WE'VE GOT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF CROP LAND DESTROYED IN MY STATE 
YOU DON'T READ MUCH ABOUT KANSAS OR NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA NEBRASKA WISCONSIN MINNESOTA SO YOU ADD ALL THOSE SIX STATES UP COMPARED TO THE OTHERS MISSOURI AND IOWA PARTICULARLY HARD AND ILLINOIS WE'VE GOT SOME REAL PROBLEMS 
VERY BRIEFLY GETTING BACK BEFORE WE HAVE TO GO TO A BREAK HERE TO THE DEFICIT REDUCTION ASPECT 
THE COMPLAINT IS THAT THE REPUBLICANS CAUSED THIS PROBLEM BY THEIR REAGAN AND BUSH PRESIDENCIES AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO STOP THE DEMOCRATS FROM CORRECTING IT 
WELL YOU KNOW YOU THINK COLUMBUS DISCOVERED AMERICA TWELVE YEARS AGO IF YOU LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT GORE AND THE PRESIDENT 
WE'VE MADE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS 
SOME OF US STILL HAVE SCARS FROM THE DEFICIT REDUCTION 
THEY'VE HAD A CONGRESS ALL THIS TIME 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE FOR FORTY YEARS IN THE HOUSE SIX OF THE TWELVE YEARS IN THE SENATE 
THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN'T SPEND ONE DIME THAT CONGRESS DOESN'T APPROPRIATE 
IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS 
SENATE MINORITY LEADER ROBERT DOLE THANK YOU 
WE'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT 
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN ON NEWSMAKER SUNDAY WHERE WE PUT YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TO OUR GUESTS 
TWO WEEKS AGO LABOR SECRETARY ROBERT REICH APPEARED ON THIS PROGRAM 
JAMES RUDOLPH OF NOGALES ARIZONA COMPARES PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN WHICH CALLS FOR TAX INCREASES WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN'S WHICH ACTUALLY CUT TAXES 
HE HAD THIS QUESTION FOR SECRETARY REICH WHY IS IT THAT WHEN REAGAN LOWERED TAX RATES THE ECONOMY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IMPROVED FOR THE BETTER WITH INCREASED TAX REVENUES WITH MILLIONS OF NEW WELL PAYING JOBS BEING CREATED 
JAMES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WHEN THE PRESIDENT REDUCED TAXES AND INCREASED SPENDING MOSTLY ON MILITARY NOW THAT WAS A TREMENDOUS SHOT IN THE ARM FOR THE ECONOMY 
IT'S VERY EASY TO TEMPORARILY STIMULATE A GREAT DEAL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BUT EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PIPER 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE OUR NATIONAL DEBT WAS LESS THAN ONE TRILLION DOLLARS 
NOW OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS FOUR AND ONE HALF DOLLARS TRILLION 
WE ARE PAYING THE PIPER AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY ALL OF US TO GET THAT DEBT DOWN 
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT MOST OF THAT DEBT MOST OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING DOWN THE DEBT BE BORNE BY PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP 
AND WE RECEIVED THIS QUESTION FOR SENATOR DOLE FOLLOWING HIS APPEARANCE ON THIS PROGRAM A FEW WEEKS AGO 
THIS IS FROM KENNETH OF SALEM MASSACHUSETTS WHO WRITES I UNDERSTAND A POLITICIAN'S PENCHANT FOR PROTECTING HIS OR HER POLITICAL PARTY BUT YOU IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BORDER ON OBSTRUCTIONISM 
BILL CLINTON NEEDS HELP NOT HINDRANCE 
IT'S NOT A PARTY ISSUE IT'S A PEOPLE ISSUE 
WHAT ARE YOU READY TO DO FOR THE PEOPLE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE YOUR APPEARANCES HERE A LITTLE BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND 
WELL I THINK KENNETH CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT TO BE AN OBSTRUCTIONIST PARTY 
WE'RE NOT OUT HERE TO EMBARRASS PRESIDENT CLINTON BUT WHEN THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN PARTY PHILOSOPHY WHETHER IT'S DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN THEN WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO STAND UP AND TO MAKE OUR CASE BUT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MANY AREAS OF AGREEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT 
WE'RE GOING TO BE HELPING ON ISSUES LIKE THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT A RUSSIAN RECONSTRUCTION PACKAGE 
SO I THINK WHEN YOU SEE THE ENTIRE LOOK BACK AT IT SIX MONTHS FROM NOW YOU'LL SAY WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY COOPERATIVE 
SENATOR DOLE THANK YOU
