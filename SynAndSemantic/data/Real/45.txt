THE LONG LABOR DAY HOLIDAY IS THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN GOODBYE TO THE SUMMER VACATION MONTHS 
A GROUP OF NEW YORKERS HAS COME UP WITH A SOMEWHAT OUTRAGEOUS TO THE SEASON 
C. N. N.'S JEANNE MOOS HAS THE STORY 
THAT'S ONE WAY TO CELEBRATE LABOR DAY THIS IS ANOTHER 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS SORT OF A PARODY OF WOODSTOCK BUT THE HIPPIES HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH DRAG QUEENS MEN DRESSED AS WOMEN THEIR LOOKS RANGING FROM GOLDILOCKS TO JACKIE KENNEDY 
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT 
WHO ARE YOU AGAIN 
NOW WHAT ARE YOU 
LA 

AND WHAT KIND OF IS YOUR THEME 
SAD TRASH 
BUT THERE IS NOTHING SAD ABOUT LEAST OF ALL THE ENTERTAINMENT 
THERE ARE PERFORMANCE ARTISTS AND DRAG QUEENS LIP TO RECORDED MUSIC 
OTHERS LIKE THIS BILLIE HOLIDAY REALLY SING 
FROM BILLIE HOLIDAY TO PATSY CLINE 
IS JUST ABOUT PEACE AND LOVE AND BEAUTY AND 
WERE BIG THIS YEAR SO WERE LEAVES 
AND WHO HAS TO WORRY ABOUT SUN WHEN YOU BRING YOUR OWN SHADE 
IT'S WATER 
I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT BE TODAY 
THERE WERE GUYS WITH WIGS AND HAIR ON THEIR CHIN NOT TO MENTION HAIR ON THEIR CHEST AND THERE WERE QUITE A FEW WITH NO HAIR AT ALL 
IT'S YOUR BASIC RUG YOU KNOW 
IT'S THE KIND I SEE THE ON C. N. N. WEARING ALL THE TIME 
THE ORGANIZER OF ALL THIS IS KNOWN AS LADY MISS BUNNY 
THIS IS HER EIGHTH 
IT AND SHE HAVE BECOME NEW YORK INSTITUTIONS 
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET READY TODAY 
OH FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
I WEAR SO LITTLE MAKEUP 
SHE FOUND THIS LITTLE OLD LADY TAKING STOCK OF 
WAS SHE SHOCKED 
IT'S A BREAK IN THE MONOTONY
