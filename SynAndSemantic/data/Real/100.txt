THE TORCH PASSES TO BILL CLINTON AND A NEW GENERATION TONIGHT'S TOP STORY ON WASHINGTON WEEK IN REVIEW 
NOW HERE'S MODERATOR PAUL DUKE 
GOOD EVENING 
THE BIG INAUGURATION PARTY IS OVER AND BILL CLINTON LIVES IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
THE NEW PRESIDENT IS PROMISING DRAMATIC CHANGE AND ASKING AMERICANS TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS TO ASSURE A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR ALL BUT THIS PROMISE OF A NEW DAY HAS ALREADY RUN INTO SOME STORMY WEATHER ON CAPITOL HILL FORCING THE WITHDRAWAL OF ONE OF MR. CLINTON'S KEY NOMINATIONS THAT OF CONNECTICUT LAWYER ZOE BAIRD TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
BUT BY AND LARGE THE WEEK HAS BEEN ONE LONG FESTIVAL OF RENEWAL WITH AMERICANS POURING INTO THE CAPITAL TO JOIN IN THE CELEBRATION 
HERE NOW TO LOOK AT THIS FIRST WEEK THAT WAS CHARLES MCDOWELL OF THE RICHMOND TIMES DISPATCH GLORIA BORGER OF U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT JACK NELSON OF THE LOS ANGELES TIMES AND HOWARD FINEMAN OF NEWSWEEK 
A NEW PRESIDENT FOR A NEW AGE HOWARD 
THAT'S RIGHT PAUL 
BEFORE WE PLUNGE BACK INTO THE ROUTINE OF ZOE BAIRD AND AMERICAN PLANES FIRING MORE MISSILES AT IRAQI INSTALLATIONS I THINK WE OUGHT TO PAUSE AND REMEMBER WHAT WAS REALLY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS WEEK WHICH IS THE TREMENDOUS SENSE OF SOCIAL AND GENERATIONAL CHANGE THAT YOU SAW AND FELT HERE IN WASHINGTON 
I WAS SITTING RIGHT BELOW CLINTON WHEN HE GAVE HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS AND I THINK AMONG THE MOST MEMORABLE THINGS THAT HE SAID WAS THAT IT'S OUR TIME LET US EMBRACE IT. AND HE ALSO SAID THAT BY THE WORDS WE SPEAK AND THE FACES WE SHOW WE FORCE THE SPRING 
IN OTHER WORDS THAT SENSE OF RENEWAL COMES AS MUCH FROM THE PAGEANTRY AS FROM THE WORDS 
AND ON THAT INAUGURATION DAY I JUST WANTED TO MENTION A FEW THINGS THAT I SAW AND HEARD THAT I THINK EXPRESS ALL OF THAT SENSE OF CHANGE 
ONE OF THEM WAS I WAS SITTING NEXT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL SECTION AND UNLIKE FOUR YEARS AGO THERE WERE A LOT OF MEN IN THE CONGRESSIONAL SECTION 
AND IN THE V. I. P. SECTION WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THAT THERE WERE THE USUAL NUMBER OF FUR COATS 
LINDA BIRD JOHNSON IN FACT HAD A STOLE THAT SHE SAID HER MOTHER HAD WORN TO THE KENNEDY INAUGURATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE 
BUT THERE WERE ALSO AFRICAN AMERICANS IN TRADITIONAL GARB COLORFUL GARB FROM THEIR NATIVE CONTINENT 
THEN I REMEMBER LEAVING THE CAPITOL GROUNDS AND WALKING THROUGH THE CORDONED OFF STREETS OF WASHINGTON BACK TOWARD THE WHITE HOUSE 
THEY WERE CORDONED OFF FOR THE PARADE 
NO TRAFFIC 
A KIND OF EERIE SENSE OF CALM AND SILENCE THERE 
AND THERE WERE FLEETS OF YOUNG ADULTS ON ROLLER BLADES 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN SO MANY KIDS ON ROLLER BLADES 
AND THERE WERE STREET DRUMMERS WITH TURNED OVER PLASTIC DRUMS JUST DRUMMING UP A STORM 
AND THEN THAT NIGHT WE WENT TO THE M. T. V. INAUGURAL BALL AND I WANT TO BE CAREFUL HERE BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT WOODSTOCK 
I MEAN IT WAS A CORPORATE EVENT SPONSORED BY A BIG FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED CORPORATION 
THERE WERE LOTS OF WASHINGTON INSIDERS AND HOLLYWOOD TYPES THERE 
BUT AROUND MIDNIGHT DON THE ROCK STAR GOT TOGETHER WITH A HIGH SCHOOL CHOIR AND TOGETHER THEY OUT A OF BOB FAMOUS SONG ANTHEM THE TIMES THEY ARE AND EVEN THOUGH AS I SAY IT WAS INSIDERS IN THE ROOM THERE WAS SOME DISTANT SENSE THERE OF SOMETHING REALLY SIGNIFICANT HAPPENING SOCIALLY 
BUT I ALSO THINK IT WAS A WARNING 
IT WAS A CELEBRATION AND A WARNING BECAUSE BOB DYLAN WAS WRITING IN PROTEST TO THE PREVIOUS GENERATION 
NOW THE BABY BOOMERS ARE IN CHARGE 
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE THERE'S A SCRAWNY KID A YOUNG BOB DYLAN AND HE'S GOING TO BE WRITING PROTEST SONGS AS THE BABY BOOMERS RUN THINGS 
THE INAUGURAL SPEECH WAS WELL RECEIVED HERE IN WASHINGTON HOWARD AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE CLEAR INVOKING THE NAME OF F. D. R. WAS THAT HE DOES INTEND TO BE AN ACTIVIST PRESIDENT 
WELL I THINK HE TRIED TO SHOW THAT BY THE WORDS BY THE OF THE SPEECH 
HE SAID ALL RIGHT LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS HERE 
IT WAS ONLY FOURTEEN MINUTES LONG 
IT WAS PUNCHY AND AUSTERE I THINK BUT ALSO SIGNALED ACTIVISM WHICH HE THEN TRIED TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS WEEK ON FRIDAY IN HIS SECOND FULL IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
HE SIGNED A BIG BUNCH OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT BASICALLY REVERSED TWELVE YEARS OF ABORTION POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING FROM ALLOWING ABORTION COUNSELING IN CLINICS TO ALLOWING THE OF THE FRENCH ABORTION PILL TO CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL POLICY 
HE SIGNED A WHOLE BUNCH OF ORDERS ON THAT AND I THINK HE WANTED TO SHOW AND I THINK WITH SOME SUCCESS THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE AN ACTIVE PRESIDENT 
ONE OF THE THINGS HE TALKED ABOUT HOWARD THAT HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN WAS SACRIFICE 
AND IT SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE READY FOR MAYBE TAX INCREASES MAYBE EVEN THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT HE'S PROMISED A TAX DECREASE TO 
WELL HE 
MAYBE A CUTBACK IN GOVERNMENT BENEFITS 
YEAH HE PROMISED TO BE THE PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT AND I THINK THE PAGEANTRY OF THIS INAUGURATION PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY SHOWED THAT EVERYTHING FROM STARTING OUT AT THOMAS JEFFERSON'S HOME THROUGH THE HOURS THAT HE SPENT GREETING AVERAGE AMERICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
BUT THE PARADOX AND THE CHALLENGE IS THAT IN ORDER TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE THAT THERE'S SOME SHARED SACRIFICE INVOLVED 
THIS IS NOT AN EASY OR PAINLESS THING TO DO FOR ESSENTIALLY A FRIENDLY GUY 
AND SO HIS GREAT CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE TO USE HIS INTIMATE STYLE HIS SENSE OF EMPATHY THAT EYE CONTACT THAT HE CAN MAKE WITH PEOPLE TO CONVINCE ALL AMERICANS THAT WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE 
HE LOST NO TIME TODAY IN MAKING CLEAR THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR JOB AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT SYMBOLS AND SIGNS OF GENERATIONAL AND SOCIAL CHANGE 
HILLARY CLINTON TOP FLIGHT LAWYER TOP OF HER CLASS AT WELLESLEY AND YALE LAW SCHOOL EFFECTIVE LEADER FOR CHANGE IN ARKANSAS AS FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS AFTER ALL THIS IS WHAT THEY DID IN ARKANSAS 
SHE RAN THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM PROGRAM SOLD IT COUNTY BY COUNTY IN ARKANSAS 
SHE'S NOT GOING TO JUST HAVE AN OFFICE IN THE EAST WING THE TRADITIONAL HOME OF FIRST LADIES SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG OFFICE IN THE WEST WING AND IT WAS MADE CLEAR THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY THE KEY PERSON IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE REFORM 
NOW IF BILL CLINTON'S GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT HE'S GOT TO SOLVE THE DEFICIT 
IF HE'S GOING TO SOLVE THE DEFICIT HE'S GOT TO CUT HEALTH CARE SPENDING WHICH IS SKYROCKETING 
HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PERSON WHO'S BASICALLY GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THAT 
THAT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT BOTH SYMBOLICALLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY FOR HOW HE'S GOING TO RUN HIS WHITE HOUSE 
YOU WERE SPEAKING OF SACRIFICE JUST A MOMENT AGO JACK AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAD TO DO ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WAS TO SACRIFICE HIS NOMINEE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S JOB 
WELL THAT'S TRUE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU PAUL I'VE KNOWN ZOE BAIRD SINCE THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION 
SHE WAS IN THE CARTER WHITE HOUSE 
SHE WAS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AT THAT TIME 
HIGHLY RESPECTED 
ONLY FORTY YEARS OLD 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE AETNA INSURANCE COMPANY 
HER BEING THE NOMINEE TO BE THE FIRST ATTORNEY WOMAN ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE UNITED STATES WAS GREETED WIDELY BY PEOPLE AS SOMETHING TERRIFIC FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION 
AND THEN IT CAME OUT VERY IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE HEARINGS THAT SHE HAD HIRED TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS PERUVIANS FOR DOMESTIC WORK HAD NOT PAID THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY OF COURSE 
AND SHE HAD VOLUNTEERED THIS INFORMATION HERSELF IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMS SHE HAD TO FILE WHEN SHE WAS NAMED BUT SHE THOUGHT AND PEOPLE WHO ON THE TRANSITION TEAM WHO HAD PUT HER UP FOR THE JOB THOUGHT AND PRESIDENT CLINTON THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD SURVIVE THAT BUT AFTER TWO DAYS OF REALLY GRILLING QUESTIONS AND A TOUGH TIME ON THE STAND FROM THE SENATORS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT 
I THINK THAT SHE MADE THE DECISION THAT IF SHE DID MAKE IT IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT AND WITHDREW AT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT 
JACK THE CAMPAIGN PEOPLE WHO OF COURSE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE TRANSITION TIME THAT CHOSE ZOE BAIRD WERE COMPLAINING THAT YOU KNOW THE TRANSITION WAS RUN BY RICH PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE REAL CONCERNS OF AMERICA WERE 
AND IN FACT OUR TALK SHOW DEMOCRACY PHONE LINES LIT UP OVER THIS QUESTION 
WHY DIDN'T THEY INCLUDING BILL CLINTON CATCH THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS 
WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT I TALKED TO ONE OF THEM TODAY WHO SAID IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE 
WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WHAT THE REACTION WOULD BE 
WE'VE NEVER HAD THIS AS AN ISSUE BEFORE 
IT WAS A CIVIL VIOLATION THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED IN NOT A CRIMINAL VIOLATION 
HER REPUTATION WAS TREMENDOUS 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF KEPT ENCOURAGING HER 
AFTER ALL EVEN AFTER THE INAUGURATION ON WEDNESDAY SHE WAS AT THE LUNCHEON THE CONGRESSIONAL LUNCHEON 
SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BIDEN 
WHILE SHE WAS SITTING THERE JIMMY CARTER CAME UP THE FORMER PRESIDENT PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER TOLD HER WHAT A GREAT CANDIDATE SHE WAS FOR THE JOB 
PRESIDENT CLINTON HIMSELF CAME UP AND TALKED TO HER AND SAID LIKENED HER PLIGHT TO THE PLIGHT HIS OWN PLIGHT DURING THE CAMPAIGN SAID STAND IN THERE THE STORMY WEATHER AS YOU MENTIONED STORMY WEATHER BUT YOU CAN WEATHER IT AND YOU WON'T BE IMPAIRED 
YOU CAN SERVE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL 
JACK 
SHE HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS BEHIND HER AND THAT SHE COULD SURVIVE IT 
JACK YOU SAID THAT SHE MADE THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW ON HER OWN 
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME WORD OUT HERE THAT SHE WAS NUDGED BY THE WHITE HOUSE BY WARREN CHRISTOPHER 
RIGHT 
THE MAN WHO HAD 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
RIGHT 
HEADED THE TRANSITION AND WHO IS NOW SECRETARY OF STATE 
RIGHT 
PUBLICLY AT THE COMMITTEE SHE WAS SAYING IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO WITHDRAW 
YET PRIVATELY WAS SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DID IT OR NOT 
WELL LET ME TELL YOU WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS FROM SOMEONE WHO I KNOW VERY WELL WHO'S VERY CLOSE TO HER 
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY MORNING SHE FIRST BROUGHT IT UP TO THE TRANSITION PEOPLE HERSELF AND SHE SAID THIS IS BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT EVEN IF I AM CONFIRMED I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB I WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INDEPENDENT RESTORE THE INTEGRITY TO IT. AND THEN LATER EVEN BROUGHT UP THAT WELL LOOK IF WE HAVE REPUBLICANS AGAINST ME WHERE WILL THE BIPARTISAN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BE AND FINALLY AFTER THAT GRUELING DAY YESTERDAY THURSDAY CAME OUT OUT OF THAT MEETING WENT INTO A MEETING WITH LAWYERS AND SAID I CAN'T DO IT I DON'T THINK THAT IF I EVEN IF I'M CONFIRMED I COULD SERVE 
TOLD WARREN CHRISTOPHER THAT AND WARREN CHRISTOPHER AGREED WITH HER 
DIDN'T GET A PUSH 
CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE 
THE WHITE HOUSE READILY AGREED 
BUT SHE WAS THE ONE 
NOW YOU MIGHT SAY COULD SHE READ THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL 
WHO KNOWS 
MAYBE SO 
BUT SHE MADE THE DECISION 
THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT 
AND SHE DID ON THE BASIS OF IF SHE WERE CONFIRMED SHE COULDN'T DO THE JOB 
ON THE SECOND DAY OF A POPULIST PRESIDENCY THAT MAY LIVE FOREVER IN REPUTATION IN HOW CHANGED IT IS WE'RE GETTING SO INSIDE WASHINGTON THAT I CAN BARELY FOLLOW IT 
FOR US WAS THIS 
FOR OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY 
YEAH 
OKAY 
FOR US OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY TYPES I ONCE WAS OUT THERE DID THIS EVENT DAMAGE CLINTON 
WELL I 
IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY 
WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN SOME PEOPLE THINK IT DAMAGED HIM TREMENDOUSLY 
I DO THINK IT DAMAGED HIM SOME 
IT WILL NOT HAVE DAMAGED HIM VERY MUCH BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT GOT STOPPED IN A PRETTY BIG HURRY BUT IF HE HAS ANOTHER NOMINEE UP THERE AND HE DOESN'T STAND UP FOR HER PUBLICLY NOW HE STOOD UP FOR ZOE BAIRD IN TALKING TO HER BUT HE DID NOT MOUNT A DEFENSE FOR HER 
THERE WAS NO POLITICAL TEAM THERE 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY POLITICAL STRATEGY TO SAVE HER 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY LEFT OUT HANGING BY HERSELF IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT IT AND SHE DID PRETTY WELL CONSIDERING 
JACK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK SHE MAY THAT THE PRESIDENT CLINTON MAY GO BACK FOR EXAMPLE TO JUDGE PATRICIA WALD HERE IN THE DISTRICT 
I MEAN WHO ARE YOU HEARING THAT HE'S GOING TO GO TO NOW 
I 
DOES IT HAVE TO BE A WOMAN 
AND DOES IT HAVE TO BE A WOMAN 
I DOUBT THAT IT HAS TO BE A WOMAN THIS TIME 
I DOUBT THAT SERIOUSLY 
I'LL TELL YOU THE NAMES I HEAR DREW DAYS WHOSE A MINORITY A BLACK THAT WAS HEAD OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
I'VE HEARD OF AS A MATTER OF FACT THREE WHITE MALES U. S. CIRCUIT JUDGE RICHARD ARNOLD OF LITTLE ROCK FRIEND OF CLINTON'S RHODES SCHOLAR JIM NEAL FAMOUS TRIAL LAWYER PROSECUTED SOME OF THE WATERGATE DEFENDANTS OR TRIED THEM AT LEAST CHARLES A WATERGATE PROSECUTOR WHO INCIDENTALLY OPERATES FROM A WHEELCHAIR 
I'VE HEARD OF THOSE AS BEING TALKED ABOUT AND I DON'T THINK HE NECESSARILY HAS TO GO TO A WOMAN 
WELL REGARDLESS OF WHO THE CHOICE IS HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION WITH PAINSTAKING CARE THIS TIME 
RIGHT 
AND HE SAID THAT 
BECAUSE THE MESSAGE FROM CAPITOL HILL ON THIS NOMINATION THIS WEEK THE MESSAGE WHICH THE SENATORS SENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS MR. PRESIDENT YOU SHOULDN'T RISK YOUR POWER AND PRESTIGE ON A FIGHT WHICH YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WIN 
YEAH I THINK IT'S INTERESTING 
ONE SLICE OF THIS WHOLE AFFAIR TO REALLY LOOK AT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS AND THEIR NEW PRESIDENT AND I THINK THE GENERAL FEELING ON THE HILL THIS WEEK WAS THAT THE DAMAGE CONTROL OPERATION WENT A LOT BETTER THAN THE SELECTION PROCESS YOU KNOW OF THE NOMINEE THAT YOU HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS NOT GEORGE BUSH ASKING HIS REPUBLICANS TO GO OUT ON A LIMB FOR JOHN TOWER THE ILL NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND HE WASN'T JIMMY CARTER WHO CAPITULATED TO THE HILL EVEN BEFORE INAUGURATION DAY AND PULLED THE NOMINATION OF TED FOR C. I. A. DIRECTOR 
BILL CLINTON WAS A GUY WHO SENT UP SOMEBODY HE LIKED AND RESPECTED AND WHEN WORD CAME DOWN FROM CAPITOL HILL THIS WEEK PARTICULARLY AFTER A DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS DEMOCRATS HAD A SESSION AND THEY WENT AROUND THE ROOM AND THEY SAID ALL RIGHT WHAT ABOUT IT AND A LOT OF GUYS STOOD UP SAID AND WOMEN WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THIS NOMINATION 
THE WORD WENT BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER GEORGE MITCHELL WAS IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH BILL CLINTON HIMSELF 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JOE BIDEN WAS TALKING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON PEOPLE AND TO THE PRESIDENT 
WHEN THE PHONE CALLS STARTED COMING IN ON THE HILL AND THEY WERE ABOUT ISSUES OF CLASS AND RACE AND PEOPLE GOT SCARED THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON 
ZOE BAIRD HAD BECOME SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN WASHINGTON 
SHE BECOMES A POLITICAL NOMINEE WITHOUT A POLITICAL CONSTITUENCY 
AND BILL CLINTON WAS TOO MUCH OF A POLITICIAN TO STAND BY HER 
HE FINALLY SAID THIS WAS IT BECAUSE THE GUYS ON THE HILL AS PAUL SAID SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR CHIPS ON THIS ONE IF YOU 
BUT ZOE HE DOES GET SOME POLITICAL MILEAGE 
GLORIA 
THAT'S GLORIA 
I'M SORRY 
EXCHANGE THE NAME 
I'M SORRY 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
ANYWAY HE DOES GET FROM SOME PEOPLE A LOT OF POLITICAL MINUS POINTS FOR NOT STANDING UP FOR HER HOWEVER HAVING PUT HER UP THERE 
WELL YOU KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF LESSONS HERE 
ONE IS YOU'VE GOT TO BE ORGANIZED IN PICKING YOUR PEOPLE 
AND TWO IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR PEOPLE TO STAY THERE THE WHITE HOUSE HAS A WAY TO DO IT 
THERE WAS NO ORGANIZATION THE WAY THERE WAS 
THAT'S RIGHT BUT 
SAY FOR CLARENCE THOMAS OR 
THAT'S RIGHT BUT 
THAT KIND OF THING 
AND THE QUESTION IS WAS THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF PREPARED TO HANDLE THIS 
IN THE END THE WHITE HOUSE DIDN'T WANT TO STAND BY ZOE BAIRD SO SHE WAS OUT THERE ALL ALONE 
BUT LET'S ALSO MAKE THE POINT THAT THIS REALLY DID TOUCH A PUBLIC NERVE ON TWO COUNTS 
THE FIRST COUNT WAS THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT HIGHEST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD NOT BE SOMEONE WHO HAD VIOLATED THE LAW 
AND THE SECOND POINT WAS THAT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE OF SOCIAL CLASS HERE THAT IF YOU WERE PRIVILEGED AND RICH ENOUGH YOU CAN SKIRT THE LAW 
WELL IT WAS INTERESTING 
AT FIRST A LOT OF SENATORS WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PHONE CALLS 
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD BEEN ORCHESTRATED BY GROUPS WHO WERE AGAINST ZOE BAIRD LIKE RALPH NADER FOR EXAMPLE WHO THOUGHT SHE WAS TOO CONSERVATIVE 
THEN WHEN THE CALLS REALLY STARTED COMING IN ONE SENATOR SAID TO ME YOU KNOW I'M GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM POOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THIS IS A RICH PERSON'S PROBLEM 
GLORIA 
OR SHE WAS HIRING PEOPLE TO TAKE AWAY MY JOB 
THESE WERE REALLY PEOPLE OUT THERE 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A POPULIST ADMINISTRATION CARING ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
WELL THE PEOPLE WERE CALLING IN AND THEY WERE NINETY PERCENT AGAINST ZOE BAIRD SO THEY HAD TO LISTEN BOTH THE MEMBERS ON THE HILL AND DOWN AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
GLORIA HE BILL CLINTON CAMPAIGNED SAYING I'M FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD AND PLAY BY THE RULES 
ALL THE DEMOCRATS AT THE CONVENTION CHEERED THAT LINE 
RIGHT 
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FOR THE MOST PART AND UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THE DEMOCRATS ON THE HILL DIDN'T HAVE ANY SENSE OF THIS EITHER 
I MEAN WHY IS IT THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY BETTER FINGERTIP FEEL FOR THIS SUBJECT THAN THE TRANSITION OFFICIALS DID 
WELL I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD TELL THAT WHEN THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT THIS THEY SAID WHAT 
DON'T YOU REALIZE THIS IS A POLITICAL PROBLEM SOME OF THEM WERE NOT AS CLUED INTO IT BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE SAID TO ME YEAH WE TOLD THESE TRANSITION PEOPLE THAT THEY NEEDED TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THIS MORE THAN THEY DID 
LET US NOTE IN PASSING THAT MR. CLINTON DID GET ALL OF HIS OTHER NOMINATIONS 
THEY SAILED THROUGH THE SENATE WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY WHATSOEVER 
ABSOLUTELY 
AND HAD ETHICAL PROBLEMS 
AND A FEW HAD ETHICAL PROBLEMS 
BUT THAT IS NO MEAN FEAT EITHER 
THAT IS NO MEAN FEAT 
EXACTLY 
FINALLY WE SHOULD SAY THOUGH DESPITE THESE TROUBLES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT AS GO CHARLIE THIS ONE WAS PRETTY GOOD 
THIS ONE WAS AMAZING AND THIS GREAT INSIDE WASHINGTON INCIDENT THAT HAS AN ETHICAL OVERTONE REALLY WAS KIND OF ONE OF THE SMALLER ITEMS OF THE WEEK IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY IT SEEMS TO ME 
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED BETWEEN THE CAPITOL AND THE WHITE HOUSE FOR AN INAUGURATION 
THAT'S THE MOST PEOPLE THAT EVER GATHERED FOR ANYTHING AROUND HERE 
GEORGE BUSH HAD THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AT HIS INAUGURATION 
RONALD REAGAN THE MOST POPULAR TIGER WE'VE HAD IN MODERN TIMES HAD FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
LET'S TRY TO GET A MEASUREMENT HERE 
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE CAME FROM SOMEWHERE TO BE PRESENT FOR THIS 
I IT WASN'T JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE 
I TALKED TO A LOT OF THEM 
I CAN TELL HOWARD WAS AMONG THEM 
YOU ALL PROBABLY WERE 
THEY WERE ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE 
THEY WERE OF ALL COLORS AGES TYPES 
THEY WEREN'T THAT INTERESTED IN POLITICS 
THEY WERE GOOD SPIRITED 
THEY HAD HOPE 
THEY TALKED ABOUT HOPE 
THERE WERE NO DEMONSTRATORS AROUND 
THERE WAS ALMOST A IN THIS CROWD IN A CRUNCH 
THE SUBWAYS WERE JAMMED 
YOU COULDN'T MOVE 
AND THERE WAS A WITH THESE PEOPLE 
IT WAS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
I TALKED WITH THEM 
THEY WERE HOPEFUL 
IDEOLOGY ALMOST NONE 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE INSIDE WORKINGS OF ZOE BAIRD UTTERLY BEYOND THEIR INTEREST 
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE ETHIC OF IT AND THE ONE THING I HEARD ALL OF THEM AGREE ON LET'S WHATEVER WAS RIGHT HERE LET'S DON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT STOOD IN THAT LINE 
THAT'S ALL I HEARD THERE 
BUT WHAT THEY WANTED WAS CHANGE 
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE DRAWN BY THE SENSE OF CHANGE AFTER ABOUT A QUARTER CENTURY OF ONE PARTY GOVERNMENT AND EVERYBODY TIRED OF WASHINGTON THIS CROWD KIND OF ANTI WASHINGTON AND PRO CLINTON BUT NOT DEVOTED 
INTERESTED IN CHANGE 
AND THEY CAME WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FRIENDS AND MORE LITTLE KIDS THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN 
CLINTON KNEW WHAT WAS UP 
HE LIKED IT SO MUCH THAT HE WASN'T EVEN LATE TO THE SWEARING IN AND HE MADE THE SHORTEST SPEECH OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE 
CHARLIE SOMETIMES IN THIS GREAT PAGEANT ALMOST PARADOXICALLY WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE MAN WHO'S BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
YEAH 
HE JUST BECOMES A FIGURE AT HIS OWN PAGEANT 
YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT CLINTON HIMSELF 
I MEAN I WAS STRUCK BY GEORGE BUSH BY THE WAY HAD PEOPLE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE FOUR YEARS AGO BUT THIS SEEMED TO I MEAN C. SPAN CARRIED THIS LIVE 
FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR 
SIX HOURS 
BILL CLINTON WAS IN THERE YOU KNOW KNEELING DOWN WHEN LITTLE KIDS CAME BY TO TALK TO THEM 
HOW DO YOU THINK HE HE SEEMED TO REVEL IN THIS THING AND HE 
HE'S SO NATURAL AT IT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
YEAH 
HE SEEMED TO BE A KIND OF NATIONAL HOST 
HE IS A HOST AND HE'S GOOD WITH THE KIDS AND HE CARES ABOUT THE KIDS 
AND HE GOT DOWN THERE WITH HIS EYES WHERE THEIR EYES WERE AND HE TALKED TO PEOPLE 
WATCHING HIM IS WHAT MATTERS IN THE AGE OF TELEVISION IN A WAY SAD TO SAY MORE THAN HOW HE TREATED ONE KID 
IT'S FASCINATING TO WATCH A MAN AT PEACE AND AS OF ONE WITH THE PEOPLE LITTLE KIDS OLD PEOPLE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE A DECENT PRESIDENT BUT HE'S INCREDIBLE WITH KIDS 
WITH AND WITH THE WOMEN THE MEN HE WAS REMARKABLE TO WATCH AS HE WAS AT THE ECONOMIC CONFERENCE 
HERE IT WAS MORE EVEN BUT THERE WAS ONE EXCHANGE THAT SHOWED HE HAS A PERFECT FACE 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THIS WOMAN SAID BUT TODAY SOMEONE PULLED IT UP AS THEY SAY IN THE SOUND BUSINESS 
A WOMAN CAME THROUGH THE LINE AND I WROTE THIS DOWN 
SHE SAID MR. PRESIDENT I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE FOUND A NEW ENERGY SOURCE 
SHE WAS PERFECTLY SERIOUS 
I'VE FOUND A NEW ENERGY SOURCE AND IT WILL CURE TWO THIRDS OF THE DEFICIT BESIDES HAVING MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL AND CLINTON DID NOT SAY WELL YOU CRAZY HE DID NOT SAY OOH 
HE SAID LET ME HAVE SOME MORE MATERIAL ON THAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AND HE'LL READ IT 
I 
IT WAS WONDERFUL 
HE WILL READ IT 
I THINK 
OR HILLARY WILL READ IT 
I THINK WE MIGHT NOTE IN PASSING TOO THAT I FELT THAT GEORGE BUSH LEFT OFFICE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CLASS AND GRACE 
I MEAN HE DISPLAYED A WONDERFUL WARMTH AND FRIENDLINESS TOWARD THE CLINTONS 
IT HAD TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT GEORGE BUSH AND IT HAD TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND OUR TRADITION 
WHEN CLINTON CAME ON THAT PLATFORM BUSH WELCOMED HIM ON THE PLATFORM SHOOK HIS HAND AND A PAT THEY PATTED EACH OTHER'S 
WHEN HE FINISHED HIS SPEECH BUSH SHOOK HIS HAND PATTED HIM SOME MORE 
WHEN BUSH WENT TO THE AIRPLANE I MEAN TO HIS HELICOPTER CLINTON WALKED WITH HIM AND THEY HAD ALMOST AN EMBRACE 
YOU JUST HAD TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHATEVER SYSTEM IT IS WE'VE GOT HERE AND THESE TWO GUYS 
WE'VE ALL WATCHED AND PARTICIPATED IN THIS WEEK AND NOW WE CLEARLY HAVE TO BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE CLINTON STYLE 
AND THE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO PUT TO ALL OF YOU IS HOW'S HE REALLY GOING TO CHANGE THE OLD TOWN 
IS HE INDEED GOING TO GIVE US A NEW WASHINGTON 
WELL HE'S GOING IT'S GOING TO BE MORE INTIMATE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
PEOPLE MAKE JOKES ABOUT THE HUGGING AND THE HOG CALLS FROM ARKANSAS AND SO ON BUT THIS IS A GUY WHO I'M SURE WILL GO UP TO THE HILL DON'T YOU THINK GLORIA 
YEAH 
I THINK HE'LL PROBABLY DO IT THE WAY HE DID BACK IN ARKANSAS 
TOO MUCH 
HE WILL IN A WAY TRY TO TURN WASHINGTON INTO LITTLE ROCK WHICH IS A CITY OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MAKE IT INTIMATE MAKE IT FAMILIAR MAKE IT IN THE OLD STYLE 
HE'S GOING TO BE CONNECTED NOT JUST WITH THE PEOPLE HE SEES BUT WE'VE SEEN SOMETHING FROM EVERYTHING FROM THE WAY HE CAMPAIGNED ON TALK SHOWS AND ON ALL KIND OF CRAZY SHOWS AND HOW HE HANDLED THOSE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE FIRST ERA TELEVISION PRESIDENT WHO REALLY IS DEALING WITH EVERY AMERICAN IN A FAIRLY FORTHRIGHT WAY 
HE MAY RISE OR FALL BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TAKEN HIS FULL SHOT 
I WONDER THOUGH WHETHER THAT ISN'T GOING TO MAKE US ALL A BIT MORE SELF CONSCIOUS 
AND MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING 
BUT THIS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TALKS A LOT ABOUT ETHICS AND IT TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE TO THE PEOPLE 
AND I THINK PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON ARE THINKING DIFFERENTLY 
IN MANY WAYS THAT'S WHY ZOE BAIRD BECAME SUCH A VICTIM BECAUSE GIVEN THIS NEW EMPHASIS ON ETHICS AND WHAT THE REAL PEOPLE IN THE REAL WORLD REALLY THINK 
YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT HE COULD RAISE THE STANDARDS OF WASHINGTON 
YEAH MAYBE 
I MEAN WE'LL BE MORE SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT AND THAT AIN'T BAD 
WELL I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE 
NO GO AHEAD 
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A NOTE HERE BUT YOU KNOW THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO GOT CONFIRMED IN THIS ADMINISTRATION WHO DID HAVE SOMEWHAT ETHICAL PROBLEMS THERE 
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT TO DEAL WITH 
WE HAVE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AT THE WHITE HOUSE OF WHERE WE'RE GETTING LESS ACCESS ACTUALLY IN THE PRESS IS 
AFTER TWO DAYS 
WELL AFTER TWO DAYS 
YEAH NOW THEY'VE SHUT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THEY'VE SHUT THEM OFF 
AND SO YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THIS ADMINISTRATION SHAKES DOWN BEFORE YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW A RENAISSANCE OR WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY GREAT CHANGES 
IT MAY BE LISTEN IT MAY BE POLITICS AS USUAL 
IF CLINTON FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T GO FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM LIKE HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO EARLY ON I'D SAY IT'LL BE 
HE'S GOT A LOT MORE 
I'LL SAY IT'LL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL 
THERE ARE TWO NOTES ONE WOULD RAISE 
ONE IS THEY HAVE A VERY MANIPULATIVE MAYBE EVEN ARROGANT ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PRESS 
THEY THINK THEY CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE OVER THEIR HEADS THROUGH TELEVISION 
THE OTHER THING IS ZOE BAIRD IS IMPORTANT SYMBOLISM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT 
WELL WHAT I THINK ABOUT IS THAT THIS SHOW IS COMING TO AN END BUT I REMEMBER A HEADLINE IN THE WASHINGTON POST THIS WEEK THAT SAID WHAT WE REALLY HAD WAS A FESTIVAL OF HUGS AND HOPES 
AND WE'LL BE HERE TO 
A LOT OF HUGS 
AND WE'LL BE HERE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE MAN FROM HOPE ARKANSAS 
THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION 
I'M PAUL DUKE
