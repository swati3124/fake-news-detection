WE BEGIN WITH A SURPRISING STORY ABOUT TEENAGERS AND SEX 
YOU MIGHT THINK ALL TEENAGERS EVERYWHERE NOWADAYS ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE 
FROM T. V. SHOWS TO MOVIES TO SCHOOLS WHERE CONDOMS ARE DISPENSED ALONG WITH SEX EDUCATION THAT'S THE PICTURE WE GET 
BUT IT'S NOT THE FULL PICTURE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN INTERESTING MOVEMENT GATHERING STEAM IN TEEN CIRCLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE IS 
YEAH WELL BELIEVE IT OR NOT MANY THOUSANDS OF TEENAGERS ARE JUST SAYING NO TO SEX VOWING TO BE VIRGINS 
AND IF THAT AMAZES YOU YOU'LL BE MORE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THEY'RE SAYING IT OUT LOUD AND IN FRONT OF OTHER TEENAGERS 
AS JOHN STOSSEL FOUND OUT IT'S A NEW TEEN SPIRIT BUT IS IT STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP THEM RESIST THE MOST POWERFUL OF TEMPTATIONS 
BEING A TEENAGER IS SO CONFUSING 
YOUR BODY GOES THROUGH INTIMIDATING PHYSICAL CHANGES 
YOUR HORMONES SEND STRANGE NEW SIGNALS AND ALL OF IT HAPPENS UNDER A BARRAGE OF CONFLICTING IMAGES AND MESSAGES 
YOUR CHURCH OR YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR SCHOOL MAY TELL YOU NOT TO HAVE SEX 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF GENITAL WARTS SYPHILIS GONORRHEA 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF 
BUT YOUR BODY AND POPULAR SAYS SOMETHING ELSE 
YOU SEE IMAGES ON T. V. WITH PEOPLE HAVING SEX AND YOU JUST PICTURE IT IN YOUR HEAD LIKE DANG 
AND THESE OTHER TEENS ARE ALL SEXUALLY ACTIVE AND ABOUT IT 
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST HAD SEX 
FIFTEEN 
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO HAVE SEX 
WELL THIS IS SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO 
THE FACT IS THESE DAYS MOST OF THE KIDS FEEL THAT WAY 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT BY AGE EIGHTEEN MOST OF THE GIRLS AND THREE FOURTHS OF THE BOYS ARE NO LONGER VIRGINS AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ACTIVE SINCE THEY WERE FIFTEEN 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOB SAYS SEX IS JUST WONDERFUL 
IMAGINE SOMETHING THAT YOU LOVE THE HAPPIEST YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND MULTIPLY IT BY TWO OR THREE TIMES AND THEN YOU'VE GOT HOW I FEEL ABOUT SEX 
KIM WAS A VIRGIN UNTIL SHE MET CHRIS 
WHY'D YOU TAKE THE EXTRA STEP WITH HIM 
BECAUSE IT WAS IT'S THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER BEEN TO ANYBODY AND I TRUST HIM A LOVE MORE THAN I'VE TRUSTED ANYONE ELSE 
LAST YEAR DECIDED SHE WAS READY 
DO YOU USE BIRTH CONTROL 
WHEN I HAVE IT 
IS THAT HALF THE TIME MORE OR LESS 
AT FIRST WHEN I HAD IT I USED IT 
IF I DIDN'T 
BUT WHAT ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT 
I AM PREGNANT NOW 
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY TEENAGERS WHO CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE SEX 
ONE IN FIVE REMAIN VIRGINS AT LEAST THROUGH THEIR TEENAGE YEARS 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD DOMINIQUE SAID NO 
I COULD HAVE SWORN I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM 
NOBODY CAN TELL ME I WASN'T BUT STILL I JUST KNEW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE 
ONE OF OUR FIRST CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE STARTED GOING OUT WAS WHAT WE WOULD AND WOULDN'T DO 
TOMMY AND ELIZABETH ARE BOTH FIFTEEN 
AND WHAT DID YOU DECIDE YOU WOULD AND WOULD NOT DO 
HANDS AND YOU KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME YEAH MAYBE WE WILL KISS BUT THAT'S 
THESE TEENAGERS ARE VIRGIN AND IN WHAT MANY PARENTS HOPE WILL BE A TREND THEY'RE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT IT PROUDLY 
THE RELATIONSHIP I'LL HAVE SEXUALLY WITH MY WIFE WILL BE SO BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT'LL BE THE ONLY ONE 
THEIR REASONS VARY 
SOME FEAR PREGNANCY OR DISEASE 
SOME SAY WAITING IS JUST THE MORAL THING TO DO 
FOR MANY THE MOST POWERFUL INFLUENCE IS THEIR RELIGION 
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION STARTED SOMETHING CALLED TRUE LOVE WAITS AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO TEACHING AND PREACHING ABSTINENCE 
WE HONESTLY TEENAGERS WERE BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT ADULTS WERE GIVING UP ON THEM 
GOVERNMENT LEADERS EDUCATORS PARENTS REALLY ALL OF ADULT SOCIETY WAS UNINTENTIONALLY SAYING TO YOUNG PEOPLE WE FULLY EXPECT YOU TO BE SEXUALLY PROMISCUOUS 
WE FELT LIKE WE NEEDED A NEW GROUP OF ADULTS WHO WOULD SAY TO TEENAGERS WE FULLY BELIEVE IN YOU 
WE THINK YOU ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF CHOOSING VALUES AND LIVING CONSISTENTLY WITH THOSE VALUES 
OTHER DENOMINATIONS HAVE JOINED THE TRUE LOVE WAITS CAMPAIGN 
SOME HOLD RING CEREMONIES WHERE PARENTS GIVE THEIR CHILD A RING AS A SYMBOL OF CHASTITY 
IN RETURN THE CHILD PROMISES HIS FAMILY AND GOD AND HIS FUTURE SPOUSE NOT TO HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE 
THE RING IS TO BE WORN UNTIL HIS OR HER WEDDING NIGHT AS A REMINDER OF THE PROMISE MADE 
AT OTHER CHURCHES TEENAGERS STAND ALONGSIDE THEIR PARENTS IN FRONT OF THE CONGREGATION AND MAKE A PUBLIC VOW OF ABSTINENCE 
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY HARD BUT I THINK WE HAVE IT EASIER THAN MOST PEOPLE 
YOU KNOW WE HAVE GOD BESIDE OUR SIDE 
EMILY IS THIRTEEN 
THAT WILL TAKE A LOT OF THE PRESSURE WAY 
THOMAS IS SIXTEEN 
GOD IS THE ONE WHO'S SAYING DON'T DO IT DON'T DO IT DON'T DO IT WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE EVEN MYSELF IS SAYING DO IT DO IT DO IT 
THIS SUMMER TRUE LOVE WAITS TEENS FROM ALL OVER AMERICA BOARDED BUSES AND WOUND THEIR WAY TO WASHINGTON D. C. TO RALLY TO CELEBRATE 
THE TEENAGERS SIGNED CARDS PLEDGING THEIR AND PLANTED TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE CARDS ON THE MALL CREATING A FIELD OF ABSTINENCE 
THEIR WORK FINISHED THIRTY THOUSAND TEENAGED VIRGINS CELEBRATED TO THE BEAT OF CHRISTIAN ROCK AND AS DAY TURNED TO DUSK THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OFTEN FEEL THE MINORITY BECAME A MAJORITY 
ADVOCATES OF COMPREHENSIVE SEX EDUCATION HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT ALL THIS 
DEBORAH IS HEAD OF A SEXUALITY INFORMATION ORGANIZATION 
I THINK WHAT THIS KIND OF ATTENTION DOES IS IT HELPS COUNTER THE EVERYBODY'S DOING IT MYTH 
WHAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THOUGH ARE THE VERY MANY PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE DESIGNED TO SCARE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM SEX 
THEY GIVE THEM THE MESSAGE THAT THEIR SEXUALITY IS BAD AT LEAST UNTIL THEY GET A WEDDING RING 
SOME KIDS HEAR THAT NOT JUST IN CHURCH BUT IN SOME SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BECOME TEACHING ABSTINENCE ONLY SEX EDUCATION CLASSES 
YOU KNOW THAT HERPES IS NOT CURABLE GENITAL HERPES 
NOW YOU CAN DIE FROM SYPHILIS IF YOU'RE NOT TREATED 
LIKE TRUE LOVE WAITS THESE SAY ABSTINENCE IS THE ONLY EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY HEALTHY OPTION FOR TEENAGER CONTROL YOUR BE A VIRGIN 
IF YOU STOP AT THE LIPS AND SAVE SEX FOR MARRIAGE THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND SOME PARENTS HAVE SUED TO HAVE THESE COURSES CHANGED ARGUING THAT BECAUSE THEY LEAVE OUT THINGS LIKE CONTRACEPTION THEY VIOLATE SOME STATE LAWS 
PREACHING TO THEM SILLY SLOGANS LIKE PET YOUR DOG NOT YOUR DATE THEY MAY MAKE US AS ADULTS FEEL BETTER BUT WE'RE NOT HELPING TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE 
BUT EVEN CRITICS LIKE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE APPROACH OF THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES DIDN'T WORK 
BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE JUST GAVE YOUNG PEOPLE FACTS AND WE JUST PROVIDED THEM WITH BIRTH CONTROL CLINICS WE COULD TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM 
WE LEARNED THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE SKILLS 
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO LEARN AND PRACTICE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
AN ALTERNATIVE TO ABSTINENCE ONLY CALLED ABSTINENCE FIRST DOES THAT 
COURSES LIKE THIS ONE IN ATLANTA USE PEER COUNSELORS TEENAGED VIRGINS THEMSELVES TO COUNSEL YOUNGER TEENS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF DELAYING INTERCOURSE 
BY PLAYING ROLES THEY TRY TO SHOW THE YOUNGER KIDS HOW TO SAY NO 
A FOUR YEAR STUDY OF THIS COURSE SHOWS IT HAS DELAYED THE ONSET OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY AMONG YOUNGER TEENS 
WELL THAT'S THE TECHNIQUE 
SAY NO 
KEEP REPEATING IT 
DON'T OFFER EXCUSES 
I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ON THE SCENE TODAY DIRECT FROM THE N. B. A. AND THE PHOENIX SUNS 
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE THE MAN IS A VIRGIN 
I GIVE YOU A. C. GREEN OF THE PHOENIX SUNS 
ON ANOTHER FRONT PRO BASKETBALL PLAYER A. C. GREEN HAS LAUNCHED ATHLETES FOR ABSTINENCE 
GREEN SPENDS MOST OF THE OFF SEASON TRYING TO CONVINCE THE KIDS 
I RESPECT MYSELF I GUESS MORE THAN I REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF THE CROWD OR BE COOL 
HE'S ALSO MADE A VIDEO AND PERSUADED OTHER ATHLETES TO MAKE A PITCH AND VIRGINS ARE BACK INTO POPULAR CULTURE 
EVEN THE T. V. SERIES BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH NOTORIOUS FOR ITS SEXUALLY ACTIVE TEENS HAS A VIRGIN 
I DON'T INTEND TO SLEEP WITH YOU 
MANY KIDS APPRECIATE THIS REASSURANCE THAT IT'S OKAY TO SAY NO 
WHEN SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE RECENTLY RAN AN ARTICLE SYMPATHETIC TO THEY RECEIVED AN OUTPOURING OF MAIL FROM KIDS 
THANKS 
I THINK MANY OF US NEEDED THAT KIND OF REASSURANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN THREE FOURTHS OF YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T VIRGINS ANYMORE 
I HATED MYSELF FOR SAYING NO BUT WHEN I READ YOUR ARTICLE I FELT SO MUCH BETTER AND AM HAPPY I SAID NO 
THANKS A BUNCH 
APPARENTLY THERE'S ENOUGH PRESSURE THAT MANY KIDS FEEL DEFENSIVE ABOUT WANTING TO WAIT 
I WANT THE NIGHT THAT I GET MARRIED TO BE AS SACRED AS IT CAN BE AND AS MUCH AS BALONEY THIS MAY SOUND IT'S THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH 
I WANT THAT ONE NIGHT AFTER I GET MARRIED TO BE THE MOST SACRED THING THAT IT COULD BE THE MOST INNOCENT THE MOST PURE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT IT CAN BE AND I JUST THINK 
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT MAY SOUND LIKE BALONEY 
YOU GET A LOT OF THAT THAT IDEOLOGY THAT JUST SAYS MAN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BEAUTIFUL YOU KNOW FEELINGS INTIMATE SAVING THE SACRED YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HEAR SACRED AND SEX IN THE SAME SENTENCE ANYMORE 
I MEAN YOU JUST DON'T 
IN ADDITION TO FIGHTING THEIR CULTURE THE VIRGINS SAY THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING THEIR OWN BODIES 
IT'S HARD 
IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR ME 
BEFORE IT WAS EASIER BUT NOW I'M EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND TURNING INTO A WOMAN 
WOMEN HAVE NEEDS OBVIOUSLY AND IT'S I MEAN THE ROPE IS STRETCHING TO A POINT WHERE YOU KNOW 
I MEAN YOU'LL MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE AND THEN WANT TO STOP 
YES 
THE GUYS RESPECT YOUR WISH 
NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME 
WELL I MEAN IT DEPENDS IF THEY'RE IF THEY'VE ALCOHOL OR DRUGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HAVE YOU LOST A GUY BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T 
MANY TIMES 
MANY TIMES 
FOR THE RELIGIOUS IT MAY BE A LITTLE EASIER 
DO YOU FEEL PHYSICAL URGES THAT IF THAT MIGHT LEAD IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR FAITH TO SEX 
YEAH 
IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY FAITH THERE THERE IS IT WOULD LEAD TO BAD THINGS BAD BAD THINGS 
I WAS IN A MOVIE THEATER AND LIKE AN IDIOT I CHOSE THE BACK SEAT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND 
FOR ABOUT THREE FOURTHS OF THE MOVIE I WAS BACK THERE MAKING OUT 
I STARTED TO FEEL THINGS WERE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE INTENSE 
IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT 
RIGHT IN THE HEAT OF MOMENT 
I SAID WAIT A MINUTE I'M JUST ABOUT TO DO THIS 
WHY IS IT OKAY TO PET AND TO GET ALL HOT AND BUT JUST NOT TO HAVE INTERCOURSE 
WHY IS INTERCOURSE THE LINE 
IT'S BECAUSE GOD DIDN'T SAY DON'T GOD DIDN'T SAY DON'T MAKE OUT IN THE BACK OF A MOVIE THEATER 
GOD JUST SAID DON'T HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE 
KISSING CAN'T CREATE A CHILD TOUCHING CAN'T CREATE A CHILD ORAL SEX CAN'T CREATE A CHILD 
FOR MANY OF US PARENTS LISTENING TO THESE TEENS FIRMLY PRAISE IT'S NATURAL TO WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A TREND AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BE BUT MANY EXPERTS SAY DREAM ON 
I THINK THAT THE ABSTINENCE TREND IS AN ADULT HOPEFUL MYTH 
I THINK WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT MORE AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ABSTAINING 
THE DATA IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
FOR THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE DATA SHOW A FAIRLY STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING SEX AND A STEADY DECREASE IN THE AGE AT WHICH THEY START 
OF COURSE THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT BEFORE 
PERHAPS THE FACT THAT THESE KIDS ARE NOW SPEAKING OUT AND DECLARING CONFIDENTLY THAT THEY WANT TO WAIT MAYBE THIS WILL START A TREND 
I WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY VIRGINS DO WE HAVE OUT THERE 
YOU KNOW THAT REMINDS ME WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE ON RAINY NIGHTS WE USED TO COUNT VIRGINS 
I WENT TO AN ALL GIRLS' SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE 
DO YOU THINK THAT THE IMPETUS TO IS PRIMARILY IN RELIGIOUS GROUPS 
YES 
THE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS GROUPS THEY'RE THE ONES ORGANIZING THIS MOVEMENT AND I THINK YOU CAN ARGUE THAT A LOT OF THOSE KIDS WOULD HAVE STAYED VIRGINS ANYWAY 
BUT IT DOES PROVIDE SOME LEADERSHIP FOR KIDS WHO JUST WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY SAYING I'M GOING TO BE A VIRGIN 
YOU KNOW BEING A VIRGIN UNTIL YOU'RE MARRIED TODAY WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING MARRIED LATER AND WE'RE ALMOST TELLING YOUNG PEOPLE TO WAIT MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
WE ARE 
IF YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO WAIT TILL MARRIAGE YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO WAIT LONGER BECAUSE THE AVERAGE MARRIAGE AGE IS TWENTY SIX 
WHEN I WAS A KID IT WAS TWENTY TWO 
SEXUAL MATURITY OF TWELVE 
YOU'RE ASKING KIDS TO WAIT TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS 
WELL MAYBE YOU CAN HOPE THAT THEY DON'T DO IT TOO YOUNG THAT THERE IS THE MATURITY TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW THE ONE NIGHT STAND SEX AND LOVE 
WE HOPE SO 
THANK YOU JOHN 
THANKS 
AND CERTAINLY SAFE 
NEXT THOSE INTIMATE THINGS THAT YOU TELL YOUR DOCTOR YOU ASSUME THAT THEY'RE CONFIDENTIAL DON'T YOU 
WELL AS THIS WOMAN LEARNED THERE ARE WAYS NOW FOR STRANGERS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN YOUR MEDICAL FILE AND EVEN USE IT AGAINST YOU
