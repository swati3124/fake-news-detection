DECEMBER TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
AFTER A YEAR OF BATTLES SCANDALS AND MISSTEPS IT SEEMED THINGS WERE FINALLY ON COURSE AND THEN THIS 
HE WAS OBSESSED WITH WOMEN 
I BLOCKED STREETS FOR HIM WHILE THESE LIAISONS WENT ON WITH THE WOMEN 
TWO MEMBERS OF CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL FROM ARKANSAS OFFER STORIES OF PAST INFIDELITY 
THESE KIND OF STORIES I DON'T THINK ARE GOING TO GO AWAY 
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE SOME MONEY OFF OF THIS 
TONIGHT FICTION OR FACT 
FIGHTING THE CHARACTER QUESTION AGAIN AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
THIS IS A. B. C. NEWS NIGHTLINE 
SUBSTITUTING FOR TED KOPPEL AND REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON CHRIS WALLACE 
IT MAY BE A SIGN OF THE TIMES BUT WE HAVE BECOME COMFORTABLE BY NOW DEALING WITH STORIES OF PRESIDENTIAL 
WE TALK EASILY ABOUT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH LUCY MERCER 
WE'VE GOTTEN TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT JOHN KENNEDY AND ALL HIS WOMEN 
BUT ALL THAT IS SAFELY IN THE PAST 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT IS SOMETHING MUCH LESS COMFORTABLE UGLY PERSONAL ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE SITTING PRESIDENT JUST ONE YEAR INTO HIS TERM 
FOUR ARKANSAS STATE TROOPERS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE CLINTON SECURITY DETAIL WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR SAY THEY HELPED HIM CARRY OUT EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS EVEN AFTER HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT 
AND ONE OF THE TROOPERS SAYS THAT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE MR. CLINTON OFFERED FEDERAL JOBS IN RETURN FOR SILENCE 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS CLEARLY STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO RESPOND ATTACKING THE ACCUSERS FLATLY DENYING THAT ANY JOBS WERE OFFERED BUT NOT SURE HOW TO DEFEND A PRESIDENT WHO'S ADMITTED CAUSING PAIN IN HIS MARRIAGE 
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ANATOMY OF THIS GROWING CONTROVERSY FROM A. B. C.'S TOM FOREMAN 
IT STARTED SUNDAY EVENING ON C. N. N. 
A TOP ADMINISTRATION AIDE USED THE WORD SCURRILOUS TODAY TO DESCRIBE CHARGES MADE IN THE CONSERVATIVE MAGAZINE AMERICAN SPECTATOR THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON WHILE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS USED STATE TROOPERS TO HELP ARRANGE DATES FOR HIM WITH A NUMBER OF WOMEN 
HE WAS OBSESSED WITH WOMEN 
AT FIRST THE ALLEGATIONS FROM TROOPERS ROGER PERRY AND LARRY PATTERSON RAISED ONLY MODERATE INTEREST 
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HE WOULD TELL ME THE BLOND OR THE OR THE OR THE LADY IN THE RED DRESS OR THE GREEN DRESS GO FIND OUT WHAT HER NAME IS 
GET HER TELEPHONE NUMBER 
AND I WOULD DO THAT 
EVEN THOUGH THEY SUPPLIED DETAILS OF DOZENS OF ALLEGED SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS MOST OF THE PRESS WAS WARY 
THE STORY RAN DEEP INSIDE THE WASHINGTON POST ON MONDAY DEEP INSIDE THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY 
BROADCAST REPORTING WAS CAUTIOUS 
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY DENOUNCED AS RIDICULOUS ALLEGATIONS WHICH EMERGED OVER THE WEEKEND THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS USED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO PERFORM QUESTIONABLE PERSONAL AND PRIVATE DUTIES 
THEN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES UNVEILED THE FINDINGS OF A FOUR AND A HALF MONTH INVESTIGATION 
IT WAS THE MOST COMPLETE ACCOUNT OF THE ALLEGED TO DATE AND SUDDENLY IT WAS OPEN SEASON ON THE PRESIDENT 
SHE WAS DRESSED IN A RAINCOAT AND A HAT AND CAME IN AT FIVE FIFTEEN IN THE MORNING AND HAD A LIAISON WITH CLINTON IN THE GAME ROOM IN THE BOTTOM FLOOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION 
DAVID DAVID DAVID THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE BIZARRE 
NEXT THING WE'RE GOING TO SEE 
HEY IT'S BIZARRE BUT HEY BILL CLINTON IS A BIZARRE GUY 
WAIT A SECOND 
MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED SO FAR IS CLEARLY OLD NEWS THE SAME TIRED ACCUSATIONS SIMPLY EMBELLISHED WITH LURID DESCRIPTIONS 
IF THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO THE STORY IT LIKELY WOULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE DIED THE DAY IT CAME OUT 
BUT THREE NEW AND SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS HAVE EMERGED AND THEY ARE CAUSING ALL THE FUSS 
THE FIRST THAT GOVERNOR CLINTON MISUSED THE POWERS OF HIS OFFICE BY ORDERING STATE TROOPERS TO HELP ARRANGE DATES WITH WOMEN AND BY MAKING THEM RUN PERSONAL FAMILY ERRANDS 
WE WERE SENT TO BLOCKBUSTERS AND TO RENT A VIDEO THINGS LIKE THAT 
PICKED UP PRESCRIPTIONS FOR MEDICAL PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THE GOVERNOR PICKED UP LAUNDRY THINGS LIKE THAT 
SECURITY WAS ACTUALLY A SECOND IT TOOK A SECOND TO BEING A BUTLER 
THE SECOND THAT THE ALLEGED AFFAIRS WENT ON MUCH LATER THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN VOTERS HEARD A LOT ABOUT CANDIDATE CLINTON'S SUPPOSED RELATIONSHIP WITH GENNIFER FLOWERS SO MUCH THAT HE EVENTUALLY WENT ON T. V. TO DENY THE CHARGES AND ADMIT HE MAY HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES 
YOU GO BACK AND LISTEN TO WHAT I SAID 
YOU KNOW I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED WRONGDOING I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED CAUSING PAIN IN MY MARRIAGE 
THE NEW REPORTS SUGGEST GOVERNOR CLINTON'S ALLEGED AFFAIRS CONTINUED AFTER THAT INTERVIEW INDEED RIGHT UP UNTIL HE LEFT ARKANSAS TO BE INAUGURATED 
AND FINALLY THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON IN RECENT MONTHS TRIED TO COVER UP HIS PAST BY OFFERING FEDERAL JOBS TO THE TROOPERS WHO KNEW ABOUT HIS ALLEGED 
THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL 
THE WHITE HOUSE ADMITS THE PRESIDENT DID CALL SOME STATE TROOPERS BUT ONLY TO ASK WHAT THEY WERE TELLING THE PRESS 
THERE IS ALSO ONE NEW PIECE OF POTENTIALLY INCRIMINATING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S TELEPHONE RECORD FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE A RECORD WHICH SHOWS HE MADE FIFTY NINE CALLS TO THE HOME AND OFFICE OF ONE OF THE WOMEN IDENTIFIED BY THE TROOPERS 
THOSE PHONE RECORDS OBTAINED BY THE L. A. TIMES AND A. B. C. NEWS SHOW INDEED THE GOVERNOR ONCE CALLED HER NUMBER AFTER ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND TALKED TO HER FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF 
ON ANOTHER OCCASION THE RECORDS INDICATE HE MADE ELEVEN CALLS TO HER HOME IN A SINGLE DAY 
NONE OF THIS PROVES ANYTHING BUT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY WAS SCRAMBLING TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL 
THE FIRST LADY TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THESE ARE OUTRAGEOUS TERRIBLE STORIES PROMOTED BY PEOPLE WHO CLEARLY HAVE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL REASON TO DO SO 
THE PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE WAS SUCH TODAY THAT HE NEVER CAME CLOSE TO REPORTERS WHO WANTED TO ASK HIM ABOUT THOSE CHARGES BUT TOMORROW THAT WILL CHANGE 
AT TWO EVENTS HE IS SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH THE PRESS AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS 
THIS IS TOM FOREMAN FOR NIGHTLINE IN WASHINGTON 
WHILE THE TROOPERS HAVE BEEN BUSY TRYING TO GET THEIR STORY INTO THE MEDIA QUESTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE TROOPERS THEMSELVES AND ABOUT THEIR LAWYER CLIFF JACKSON WHO HAS AGGRESSIVELY BEEN DOING ALL HE CAN TO PUBLICIZE THEIR ALLEGATIONS 
WITH MORE ON THIS PART OF THE STORY HERE'S MIKE VON FREMD 
CLIFF JACKSON WAS A COLLEGE CLASSMATE OF BILL CLINTON'S AT OXFORD AND CLAIMS HE WAS ONCE A GOOD FRIEND 
BUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DURING THE CRUCIAL PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY JACKSON WAS THE FIRST TO GO TO THE PRESS TO SAY HE HAD PROOF THAT BILL CLINTON DODGED THE DRAFT 
EVER SINCE HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE COULD TO DESTROY CLINTON'S POLITICAL FUTURE 
WHEN A CANDIDATE WHETHER IT'S BILL CLINTON OR GEORGE BUSH IS PACKAGED IN A MANNER THAT IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES FROM THE TRUTH WE NEED TO KNOW THAT 
WE NEED TO KNOW THE REAL MAN WHO IS OCCUPYING THE WHITE HOUSE 
JACKSON NOT ONLY INSISTS ON BEING PRESENT DURING ALL THE INTERVIEWS AT TIMES HE INTERRUPTS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE MORE EXPLICIT 
THIS IS WHAT JACKSON DID WHEN TROOPER LARRY PATTERSON WAS TALKING ABOUT GENNIFER FLOWERS 
WAIT JUST A MINUTE LARRY 
YOU'RE STILL NOT MAKING THE POINT 
I MEAN THE POINT GENNIFER FLOWERS CLAIMED THAT HE GOT HER THE STATE JOB AND YOU HEARD THE CONVERSATION 
THE TROOPERS MAKE ACCUSATIONS SUCH AS SEEING WOMEN ESCORTED INTO THE MANSION FOR LATE NIGHT RENDEZVOUS BUT WHEN PRESSED IT TURNS OUT THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR ALLEGATIONS ARE SECOND HAND 
DID YOU SEE THAT YOURSELF THOUGH 
DID I ACTUALLY SEE IT 
YEAH 
NUMBER 
ARKANSAS STATE POLICE PERSONNEL FILES ON TROOPER PATTERSON REVEAL THAT HE WAS SUSPENDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOR SLAPPING HIS WIFE 
FILE CRITICIZED HIM FOR BEING ABSENT MINDED AND IRRESPONSIBLE 
BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE REPORTS ARE HIGHLY COMPLIMENTARY AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR CLINTON WROTE PERRY A LETTER PRAISING HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE AND TODAY THEIR BOSS WAS DIRECTLY ASKED ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY 
DO YOU THINK THESE MEN ARE LYING 
I'M NOT GOING TO CALL THE MEN A LIAR 
I DON'T KNOW AND I THE ONLY WAY I KNOW OF TO ANSWER YOU IS I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT DO KNOW ARE THOSE TWO MEN AND BILL CLINTON 
FOR NOW IT APPEARS THE JOBS ARE SECURE 
UNLIKE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WHO ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM REVEALING ANYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THEY PROTECT UNDER ARKANSAS REGULATIONS TROOPERS ARE FREE TO SPEAK TO ANYONE ABOUT ANYTHING AND THESE TWO TROOPERS ARE NOW ATTACKING THE MAN THEY USED TO PROTECT 
MIKE VON FREMD FOR NIGHTLINE IN LITTLE ROCK 
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL BE JOINED BY THE TWO LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS STORY FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND BY THE NEW POLITICAL REPORTER SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL 
JOINING US NOW ARE THE TWO REPORTERS WHO WROTE THE LOS ANGELES TIMES STORY THAT PROPELLED THIS CONTROVERSY 
IN OUR LOS ANGELES BUREAU WILLIAM AND JOINING US HERE IN WASHINGTON IS CO WRITER DOUGLAS AS WELL AS SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL THE WASHINGTON EDITOR FOR THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE WHO HAS COVERED POLITICS FOR TWENTY YEARS 
DOUG I WANT TO START WITH THE SENSE OF DISCOMFORT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THIS STORY 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SITTING PRESIDENT 
THE ISSUE OF INFIDELITY HAS ALREADY BEEN JUDGED BY THE VOTERS 
WHY PURSUE THIS STORY FOR FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS 
WELL I MEAN BILL AND I ARE ABOUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE ISSUES AS ANYONE CAN BE 
WE SPENT MONTHS GOING OVER THEM AND TRYING TO CORROBORATE THEM AND IT'S NOT A PLEASANT TASK 
IT'S NOT PLEASANT TO ASK PEOPLE THESE QUESTIONS 
BUT WE DO THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS STORY AND THE ALLEGATIONS GO WELL BEYOND INFIDELITY THEY GO BEYOND WHAT CAME OUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND THEY GO TO THE HEART OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN RECENT WEEKS TO TRY AND SILENCE THESE TROOPERS TO DISCOURAGE THEM TO KEEP OUT 
I THINK THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGES IN OUR STORY HINGE ON THE PRESIDENT'S CALL TO A TROOPER OFFERING HIM A JOB AS A REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY OR A LITTLE ROCK U. S. POST AND OFFERING A JOB THROUGH HIM TO ROGER PERRY IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE THEM TO KEEP OUT 
I THINK THOSE ARE ACTIONS TAKEN ACCORDING TO OUR TROOPERS BY A SITTING PRESIDENT AND THEY RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT JUST WHAT IT IS BILL CLINTON IS TRYING TO HIDE AND HOW FAR HE'S WILLING TO GO 
BUT BILL GOING THROUGH BILL CLINTON'S PHONE RECORDS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SEEING HOW MANY TIMES HE TALKED TO A WOMAN AND FOR HOW LONG HONESTLY DID YOU HAVE ANY QUALMS ABOUT DOING THAT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT REALLY PROVES 
WELL UNDERSTAND THAT WE WENT TO THOSE RECORDS TO CORROBORATE THE STORIES OF TROOPERS 
IT WASN'T TO COUNT HOW MANY PHONE CALLS WERE MADE 
IN FACT WE DIDN'T KNOW WE WOULD FIND THAT WHEN WE LOOKED IN IT 
WE WERE TOLD BY TROOPER LARRY PATTERSON HOWEVER THAT WE THAT HE HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY AIDES TO GOVERNOR CLINTON DURING NINETEEN NINETY AND TOLD THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE PRESS MIGHT GET ONTO SOME OF HIS PHONE CALLS TO A GIRL TO A FRIEND THAT IF THEY DID THEY WANTED THE AIDE WANTED LARRY PATTERSON TO TAKE THE BLAME TO TELL THE PRESS THAT HE MADE THOSE PHONE CALLS THAT THOSE WERE HIS PHONE CALLS AND THAT BILL CLINTON MEANWHILE WOULD PAY THE FORTY DOLLARS THAT HE'D RUN UP IN CHARGES 
WE WERE LOOKING TO SEE IF THAT WOULD CHECK OUT AND SURE ENOUGH NOT ONLY DID WE FIND ALL THESE PHONE RECORDS THAT SHOWED THAT HE DID MAKE THE PHONE CALLS BUT WE FOUND THE CHECK THAT BILL CLINTON WROTE FOR FORTY DOLLARS AND SIXTY FIVE CENTS WITH HIS HANDWRITTEN NOTE ON IT FOR PHONE CALLS 
SIDNEY WE ALL TALK ABOUT WHERE WAS THE PRESS WHEN JACK KENNEDY WAS HAVING ALL OF HIS AFFAIRS 
ISN'T THIS FAIR GAME 
THIS STRIKES ME AS A LARGE DELIBERATE DISTRACTION 
I THINK THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE'S A SMALL FAR RIGHT WING GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO THROUGH THESE DISGRUNTLED STATE TROOPERS HAVE PUT OUT SALACIOUS DETAILS AND THROUGH THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PULL THE STRINGS OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IN SENDING THEM I THINK LIKE MINDLESS DOWN BLIND ALLEYS 
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO THIS WHAT WE HAVE FOUND FOR THE MOST PART ARE OF THESE CHARGES 
NOW I WISH TO ADD THAT NOT ONLY IS CLIFF JACKSON INVOLVED WHO YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR EARLIER REPORT WHO HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A VERY LONG TIME POLITICAL AND PERSONAL VENDETTA AGAINST THE PRESIDENT BUT A YOUNGER RIGHT WING WRITER I HESITATE TO CALL HIM A JOURNALIST DAVID BROCK WHO'S WRITTEN ON ANITA HILL AND ACCUSED HER OF BEING PART OF A CONSPIRACY AND A CHARGES THAT WERE VERY CONVINCINGLY IN THE NEW YORKER MY MAGAZINE BY TWO WALL STREET JOURNAL WRITERS 
NOW IN HIS REPORT HE PRODUCES CHARGES MADE BY THESE TROOPERS ABOUT THE FIRST LADY'S SO CALLED SEXUAL ACTIVITIES 
THEY'RE QUITE LURID QUITE EXPLICIT ABOUT HER AFFAIRS 
NOW EITHER THEY'RE TRUE OR THEY'RE NOT TRUE 
NOW BROCK HAS SAID IN THE WASHINGTON POST OF TOMORROW THAT IT'S PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL 
IN OTHER WORDS MORE EVIDENCE 
WELL IT'S TRUE OR NOT 
WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEFEND DAVID STORY BY ANY MEANS 
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CORROBORATION THAT WE HAVE 
BILL LET ME ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU ADMIT QUITE CANDIDLY THAT YOU WERE CONTACTED ON THIS STORY BY THIS CLIFF JACKSON 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THIS NOTORIOUS CLINTON BASHER DOES THAT IN ANY WAY YOUR STORY 
CERTAINLY NOT 
CLIFF JACKSON WAS A SOURCE OF OUR STORIES LAST YEAR ON THE DRAFT BUT MORE THAN THAT A SOURCE ONLY GOES SO FAR 
A SOURCE MAKES AN INTRODUCTION AND THAT'S WHAT CLIFF DID 
HE CALLED ME IN FACT BEFORE THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR EVER CAME TO LITTLE ROCK 
WE WERE IN LITTLE ROCK WE WERE DOWN THERE BEFORE THERE WAS ANY RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY HATCHED BUT CLIFF JACKSON MADE THE INVEST MADE THE INTRODUCTION OF US TO THE TROOPERS AND AT THAT POINT IT CEASED TO BE A CLIFF JACKSON ENTERPRISE IT WAS AT THAT POINT A REPORTING ENTERPRISE AND AT THAT POINT WE HAD TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE TROOPERS AND THEN WE HAD TO CORROBORATE WHAT THEY HAD TO TELL US 
AND IF THEY DIDN'T IF IT WASN'T THERE WASN'T A STORY 
THAT'S WHAT WE DID NEXT IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PIECE OF JOURNALISM LOOKING AT RECORDS AND TALKING TO PEOPLE HOURS DAYS WEEKS OF INTERVIEWS 
AND CLIFF JACKSON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THAT WAS TWO REPORTERS FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES 
GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO BREAK IN HERE BUT WHEN WE RETURN I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL ABOUT JUST HOW STRONG THE EVIDENCE IS ON SOME OF THE MAJOR ALLEGATIONS AND ALSO WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING HOLES IN THEIR STORY 
AND WE'LL BE BACK IN A MOMENT 
AND WE'RE BACK NOW WITH BILL DOUG AND SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL 
DOUG I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE TWO MOST SERIOUS CHARGES THAT YOU MAKE IN YOUR STORY ARE ONE THAT CLINTON CONTINUED HIS AFFAIRS RIGHT THROUGH THE ELECTION AND TWO THAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE HE WAS OFFERING THESE TROOPERS FEDERAL JOBS IN RETURN FOR THEIR SILENCE 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOUR EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS JUST THE TESTIMONY OF THE STATE TROOPERS CORRECT 
YES BY AND LARGE IT IS 
IT'S THEIR CORROBORATED TESTIMONY OF TESTIMONY AS STATEMENTS OF OF IN ONE CASE AT LEAST TWO STATE TROOPERS AND IN ANOTHER CASE IN THE MOST SERIOUS CASE IS INDEED CHRIS THE PHONE CALL AND THERE WE HAVE ONLY THE WORD OF THE TROOPER WHO RECEIVED IT AGAINST THE WORD OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
BUT THAT TROOPER UPON RECEIVING THOSE PHONE CALLS CONTEMPORANEOUSLY DESCRIBED THEM TO TWO OTHER PEOPLE 
ONE OF THEM WAS ROGER PERRY WHO TOLD US ABOUT THOSE CALLS INITIALLY AND THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED BY THE REPORTER WHO OR BY THE BY THE TROOPER WHO RECEIVED THEM AND ALSO HE TOLD THEM TO ANOTHER TROOPER AND THAT TROOPER ALSO CONFIRMED FOR US THE SUBSTANCE OF THOSE CALLS AS DESCRIBED BY THE TROOPER WHO RECEIVED HIM 
YOU KNOW WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
I GUESS I'D ASK WHY IS THAT ENOUGH EVIDENCE 
WELL IT'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT OUT THERE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH OTHER EVIDENCE CORROBORATING THE UNDERLYING ALLEGATIONS THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON WHILE THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS AND AFTER BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT WAS HAVING AFFAIRS WITH WOMEN OTHER THAN HIS WIFE 
ALL FOUR OF THE TROOPERS WE INTERVIEWED IN DEPTH OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS CONFIRMED INDEPENDENTLY THAT THEY TOOK CLINTON TO LATE NIGHT MEETINGS WITH GENNIFER FLOWERS AND WITH OTHER WOMEN 
ONE OF THE WOMEN THEY DESCRIBED WAS THE WOMAN WHOSE HOME RECEIVED THE TELEPHONE CALLS AND WHOSE OFF WHO GOT THE TELEPHONE CALLS AT THOSE OFFICES 
THAT WAS FOR US VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION THOSE TELEPHONE RECORDS WHEN WE CAME ACROSS THOSE SHOWING THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT BILL CLINTON HAD WITH THIS WOMAN AND THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN WE QUESTIONED THEM ON SUNDAY NIGHT ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WOMAN EXCEPT TO SAY THE PRESIDENT CALLS A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES HE CALL AT ONE THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND TALK FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AND THEN CALL BACK FOR EIGHTEEN MINUTES A FEW HOURS LATER THAT MORNING 
SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL I CAN SEE 
AND CHRIS CHRIS 
WELL LET ME BRING IN SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL AT THIS POINT 
I SEE YOU'RE NOT BUYING THIS 
THIS IS HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE BUT NO PROOF WHATSOEVER 
IN FACT THE WASHINGTON POST THIS MORNING REPORTED THAT THE SECRET SERVICE WHICH WAS AROUND THE PRESIDENT ELECT PRESIDENT ELECT CLINTON AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS LEAVING LITTLE ROCK WHEN THESE TROOPERS WERE CLAIMING HE WAS SAYING GOODBYE TO A GIRLFRIEND CLAIMED THAT THIS WAS UNTRUE 
THE SECRET SERVICE SAYS IT'S UNTRUE ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST 
I DON'T THINK THEY RESPONDED TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE 
WELL YES THEY WERE 
AND THAT'S IN THE POST THIS MORNING 
BUT THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE AND THAT IS THE QUESTION OF PERSPECTIVE 
WHAT WE SEE HERE IS A KIND OF GERALDO EFFECT WHERE THE PRESS IS CHASING DOWN THESE ALLEYS AND YOU HAVE POLITICAL FORCES THAT SET THEM IN MOTION THAT GET WHAT THEY WANT OUT OF IT 
THEY CREATE THIS KIND OF EFFECT THROUGH THE GRADUAL SLIPPAGE OF STANDARDS AND THE PRESS THINKS IT'S DEALING WITH FACTS 
BUT IN FACT THERE ARE POLITICAL MOTIVES AND POLITICAL FORCES THAT ARE BEHIND THIS THAT OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS PERSPECTIVE BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THESE QUESTIONS RATHER THAN THINKING IN A NARROW WAY 
LET ME GET TO BILL ON THAT ISSUE 
I MEAN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUGGESTION THAT THESE TROOPERS ARE SOMEHOW THE TOOL OF CLIFF JACKSON 
RIGHT 
THERE'S BEEN THE SUGGESTION THEY'RE IN THIS TO MAKE MONEY 
WHY DO YOU THINK THESE TROOPERS HAVE COME FORWARD 
YEAH YEAH 
THESE TROOPERS HAVE COME FORWARD FOR NO PROMISE OF MONEY 
THEY'VE BEEN PAID NOTHING 
THEY'VE DONE THIS AT GREAT RISK TO THEIR PERSONAL CAREERS AND TO THEIR COMFORT IN THEIR HOME STATE AND THEIR HOMETOWN 
WHY 
I THINK THEY'VE DONE IT AS A IT'S A IT'S AN EXHIBITION OF COURAGE NOT NOT SOME KIND OF MANIPULATION 
THEY WERE TROUBLED BY WHAT THEY DID THEY HAVE IT'S A CONCERN THAT HAS OVER THE MONTHS AND YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE ANYBODY'S TOOL 
SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT AND I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR DOUBTS THIS IS YOU KNOW PERCEPTION IS REALITY THIS STORY IS ALL OVER THE NETWORKS ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGES 
HOW DOES THE WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO GET PAST THIS 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR STRATEGY IS ABOUT THIS SORT OF BUSINESS 
I REGARD THIS AS A RATHER TRIVIAL BUSINESS 
YOU KNOW THE CLINTONS RATHER PAINFULLY AND PUBLICLY DISCUSSED THE DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR MARRIAGE AS THEIR INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN VOTERS 
AND THE VOTERS ELECTED BILL CLINTON PRESIDENT 
WHAT THIS STORY SAYS IS SIMPLY THAT IT SUGGESTS WITHOUT CORROBORATION YET THAT BILL CLINTON HAD AFFAIRS WHICH IS SOMETHING HE HAS ADMITTED 
THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS INVOLVED HERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PUBLIC FIGURES AND WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS ANY BEARING ON THEIR PUBLIC PERFORMANCE 
AND THERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THEN ABOUT JOURNALISTIC PROPRIETY AND STANDARDS 
YOU KNOW LET ME RESPOND TO THAT CHRIS IF I MAY 
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS 
OKAY 
WELL SIDNEY SAYS HE THAT THE PRESIDENT WENT ON T. V. AND ADDRESSED THESE QUESTIONS 
IN FACT ACCORDING TO OUR TROOPERS HE LIED WHEN HE WENT ON TELEVISION AND SAID THAT HE DID NOT HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH GENNIFER FLOWERS 
FOUR OF THESE TROOPERS SAY THAT THEY DELIVERED HIM FREQUENTLY TO LATE NIGHT RENDEZVOUS THERE 
THEY RECEIVED HER CALLS AT THE MANSIONS FOR HUNDREDS OF CALLS OVER A PERIOD OF TWELVE YEARS 
DOUG WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
WE'RE JUST FLAT OUT OF TIME 
DOUG BILL SID BLUMENTHAL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT 
AND I'LL BE BACK IN A MOMENT 
TOMORROW ON WORLD NEWS TONIGHT WITH PETER JENNINGS THE AMERICAN AGENDA LOOKS AT HOW ONE SCHOOL HANDLES CHRISTMAS IN A MULTICULTURAL WORLD 
THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT ON THIS A. B. C. STATION 
AND THAT'S OUR REPORT FOR TONIGHT 
I'M CHRIS WALLACE IN WASHINGTON
