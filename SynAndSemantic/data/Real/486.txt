THE ELITE GROUP OF ASTRONAUTS WHO FLEW THE U. S. APOLLO MOON MISSIONS LOST ONE OF ITS OWN THIS WEEK 
STUART WAS BURIED WITH FULL MILITARY HONORS THURSDAY 
AS C. N. N.'S JOHN ZARRELLA REPORTS WAS PART OF AN APOLLO FLIGHT THAT ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE MOON 
STUART FLEW IN SPACE ONLY ONCE BUT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE APOLLO FOURTEEN MISSION HE WAS PART OF WAS CRITICAL 
IT CAME ON THE HEALS OF APOLLO THIRTEEN WHICH HAD TO BE ABORTED WHEN AN OXYGEN TANK FOR FUEL CELLS EXPLODED 
AMERICANS WERE QUESTIONING WHETHER NASA HAD JUST BEEN LUCKY ON PREVIOUS MOON MISSIONS 
ON APOLLO FOURTEEN THERE WAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN AGAIN 
AS COMMAND MODULE PILOT MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO DOCK KITTY HAWK WITH THE LUNAR MODULE 
FINALLY ON THE SIXTH TRY IT WORKED 
THE CREW COULD NOW HEAD FOR THE MOON 
ALAN SHEPARD AND EDGAR MITCHELL WENT DOWN TO THE MOON'S SURFACE 
STAYED BEHIND ORBITING IN KITTY HAWK 
DURING AND IN FLIGHT NEWS CONFERENCE ON THE WAY HOME TALKED OF SEEING THE LUNAR LANDER AS HE ABOVE 
IT JUST SHOWED UP AS A WHITE SPOT OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING FOREIGN TO THE LUNAR SURFACE REFLECTING LIGHT 
WAS ONE OF ONLY SIX HUMANS TO EVER CIRCLE THE MOON ALONE 
THOSE ASTRONAUTS OFTEN JOKE THEIR CLUB IS MORE EXCLUSIVE THAN THE CLUB OF TWELVE WHO ACTUALLY WALKED ON THE LUNAR SURFACE 
WAS 
HE RARELY TOOK CREDIT FOR HIMSELF 
HE ALWAYS PRAISED HIS COUNTRY FIRST 
I WANT YOU TO LOOK UP AT THAT MOON AND I WANT YOU TO VISUALIZE THERE ARE SIX UNITED STATES FLAGS PLANTED ACROSS THAT MOON 
AT SIXTY ONE STUART DIED YOUNG FROM COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING AN ILLNESS 
MAY NOT BE ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN ASTRONAUTS BUT HE IS STILL CONSIDERED AN AMERICAN HERO CERTAINLY BY THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT EXCLUSIVE CLUB
