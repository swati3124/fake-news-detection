IF YOU WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE TRAFFIC AND SMOG THAILAND MAY BE ONE PLACE TO GO BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL 
C. N. N.'S TOM MINTIER REPORTS 
MANY TOURISTS WHO COME TO BANGKOK LEAVE WITH THIS MEMORY TRAFFIC JAMS AND AIR POLLUTION 
THEY CAN ESCAPE THE HEAT IN AIR CONDITIONED HOTEL ROOMS THERE ARE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE CITY 
BUT FOR THOSE WILLING TO ROUGH IT A LITTLE A SMALL NINE ROOM INN COULD OFFER THEM SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
WELCOME TO THE THAI HOUSE AN ORIENTAL VERSION OF A EUROPEAN BED AND BREAKFAST OR AN AUSTRALIAN FARM STAY 
DURING YOUR VACATION YOU LIVE AND EAT AS A LOCAL 
THE SURROUNDINGS ARE CLASSICAL THAI JUST AS YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BUILT THE THAI HOUSE THREE YEARS AGO ON A SMALL PIECE OF LAND JUST OUTSIDE BANGKOK 
I MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE AND EASY NOTHING BUT A LUXURY THING 
THERE'S NO AIR CONDITION AND OUTDOOR THE REAL THING EVEN THE WOOD 
EVEN THE BEDROOM IS LIVING ON THE FLOOR THAI STYLE OLD STYLE 
AND TO VISIT THERE YOU LIKE IT 
SO FAR THERE'S NOBODY COMPLAINED 
GUESTS ALSO DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FOOD 
THEY PREPARED IT THEMSELVES 
THAI HOUSE OFFERS COOKING CLASSES FOR THEIR GUEST 
STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THAI SPICES AND VEGETABLES HOW TO PREPARE FAMOUS DISHES LIKE SPICY SHRIMP CURRY 
THESE THREE MEN ARE FROM GERMANY 
THEY CAME TO THAI HOUSE TO LEARN TO COOK ON THEIR VACATION 
JOHN IS A BIOLOGIST 
HE SAYS A HOTEL MAY BE MORE LUXURIOUS BUT 
IMPERSONAL 
A HOTEL IS THE SAME ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THE THAI HOUSE IS A FAMILY HOME WHICH YOU CAN EXPERIENCE IN THAILAND 
JOHN AND HIS FRIENDS DID FIND SOME EXCITEMENT DURING THEIR STAY A RIDE ALONG THE IN A LONG TAIL BOAT 
WITH A HUGE TRUCK ENGINE PROVIDING THE POWER IT WOULD BE A RIDE REMEMBERED FOR A LONG LONG TIME 
BUT THAILAND IS A NATION OF CONTRASTS 
YOU CAN ALSO FIND PEACE AND QUIET IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
