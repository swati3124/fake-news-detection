IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ALREADY TWELVE YEAR OLD GREGORY KINGSLEY WHO YOU MET RIGHT HERE LAST WEEK HAS WON THE RIGHT TO BE ADOPTED BY HIS FOSTER PARENTS 
LATER ON IN THIS BROADCAST WE'LL HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH GREGORY TO HEAR HIS REACTION 
BUT FIRST WE BRING YOU GENERAL NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF 
HUGH 
IN THE TWO SHORT YEARS SINCE THE JUBILATION OVER THE GULF WAR VICTORY PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN SHIFTING RADICALLY 
POINTED QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED WAS THE WAR STOPPED TO SOON 
SHOULD WE HAVE GONE AHEAD INTO BAGHDAD AND SADDAM HUSSEIN 
WELL GENERAL NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF IS NOW ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS IN HIS NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY ENTITLED IT DOESN'T TAKE A HERO 
AND THE TITLE INCIDENTALLY COMES FROM SOMETHING THE GENERAL SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH BARBARA RIGHT AFTER THE GULF WAR 
IT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO THAT GENERAL SCHWARZKOPF RETIRED AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE MILITARY 
AND NOW WE HAVE HIS FIRST TELEVISION INTERVIEW SINCE THEN 
TONIGHT THE GENERAL REVEALS WHAT REALLY WENT ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THE TOP SECRET ARGUMENTS YOU NEVER HEARD 
HE ALSO GIVES HIS PERSONAL OPINION ABOUT GAYS IN THE MILITARY AND GOVERNOR CLINTON AS A POSSIBLE PRESIDENT AND A PAINFUL REVELATION ABOUT HIS PAST 
HERE NOW THE GENERAL SPEAKS HIS MIND 
IT WAS IN THIS WAR ROOM AND ON THIS SECURE TELEPHONE THAT GENERAL SCHWARZKOPF DISCUSSED TWO CRITICAL AND CONTENTIOUS DECISIONS WITH WASHINGTON WHETHER THE WAR WOULD BEGIN AND WHEN IT WOULD END 
THE START DATE FOR THE GROUND OFFENSIVE WAS THREATENED BY WEATHER AND THE CEASE FIRE CAME A DAY EARLIER THAN HE HAD RECOMMENDED 
GENERAL H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF 
THE GULF WAR CAPPED AN ILLUSTRIOUS THIRTY FIVE YEAR ARMY CAREER FOR NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF 
THAT CAREER STARTED HERE THE U. S. MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT AND INCLUDED TWO TOURS IN VIETNAM AND A MAJOR ROLE IN THE U. S. INVASION OF GRENADA 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE TO COME BACK TO WEST POINT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT SORT OF ALL CAME TOGETHER HERE 
AND THIS IS WHAT MADE US WHAT WE ARE 
NOW THIS BUILDING WHICH IS NOT LIKE ANY OF THE OTHERS THIS WAS WHERE YOU THIS WAS YOURS 
THIS IS CALLED THE FIRST DIVISION 
THE COMPANY A ONE WHICH OCCUPIED THE FIRST DIVISION 
MY FIRST DAY AT WEST POINT WE CAME OVER HERE AND WE WERE STANDING AT ATTENTION FACING THAT BALCONY UP THERE 
AND THE SENIORS THE FIRST CLASS MEN WERE ALL STANDING AROUND LOOKING DOWN AT US AND WE WERE RIGID AT ATTENTION 
AND I WAS LOOKING AT THESE GUYS AND THEIR SHOES WERE SHINING LIKE DIAMONDS AND THEY WERE ALL SVELTE AND HANDSOME AND THEY LOOKED LIKE GODS 
AND I REMEMBER SAYING I CAN NEVER LOOK LIKE THAT 
I JUST NEVER EVER EVER WILL LOOK LIKE THAT 
AND THAT HAPPENED RIGHT THERE 
AND TODAY'S CADETS WERE AMAZED TO DISCOVER THAT RIGHT HERE WHERE PUNISHMENTS ARE METED OUT HE HAD NEVER MARCHED A SINGLE PUNISHMENT TOUR 
HOW MANY HOURS ON THE AREA DID YOU HAVE 
OR DID YOU HAVE ANY 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I NEVER WALKED AN HOUR ON THE AREA 
THAT'S A FACT 
I NEVER DID 
NOW I WILL NOT SAY THAT I NEVER MADE A MAJOR INFRACTION 
I WILL SAY THAT I WAS NEVER CAUGHT 
AFTER OUR WALK THE GENERAL AND I GOT DOWN TO SERIOUS BUSINESS THE QUESTIONS THAT STILL HAUNT THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE GULF WAR AND ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE PRESIDENT BUSH AS A COMMANDER IN CHIEF BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR 
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN 
YES A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN 
TEN 
REALLY 
ABSOLUTELY 
ABSOLUTELY 
PRESIDENT BUSH IN EVERY ENCOUNTER I EVER HAD WITH HIM AS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT FROM THE DAY I WALKED IN FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING TO CAMP DAVID TO HIS ENCOUNTERS COMING OVER DURING THE WAR ABSOLUTELY WAS EVERYTHING THAT ANY THEATER COMMANDER COULD HAVE EVER ASKED FOR IN A COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN COLIN POWELL 
TEN 
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN DEFENSE SECRETARY RICHARD CHENEY 
NINE AND A THREE QUARTERS 
AH OKAY 
NO HE WAS WE WERE A TEAM 
WE WERE A TEAM AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING MOMENTOUS DECISIONS YOU HAVE THAT MANY INVOLVED A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH GREAT EGOS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE DEBATE THAT GOES ON AND THAT SORT OF THING 
BUT THE AMAZING PART ABOUT IT WAS THAT ON EVERY DECISION WHEN IT FINALLY CAME ABOUT WE WERE ALL IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT 
WELL LET ME PICK UP SOME THINGS THAT YOU DO SAY 
OKAY 
YOU WRITE THAT SECRETARY CHENEY WAS ONE OF THE COLD WARRIORS IN CONGRESS 
YOU WORDS NOT MINE 
AND THAT THERE WERE TIMES DURING THE WAR WHEN HE WANTED TO OUT GENERAL THE GENERAL 
NO I SAID IN THE BOOK WHAT I REALLY SAID WAS I WAS CONCERNED AT ONE POINT THAT HE MAY HAVE HE MAY START BEING LIKE SOME OF THE FORMER SECRETARY OF THE ARMY I HAVE SEEN WHO TRIED TO OUT GENERAL THE GENERAL 
WELL HE HAD HIS OWN OFFENSIVE PLAN THAT YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH 
YEAH AND THAT WAS BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME 
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S WHY I SAID NINE AND THREE QUARTERS 
BUT FOR THE MOST PART HE STAYED VERY MUCH VERY STRICTLY IN THE POLICY WE HAD 
ON THE EVE OF THE GROUND WAR YOU WRITE THAT ALL THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS WERE FOR YOU 
THE ONLY AGENCY TO DISSENT WAS THE C. I. A. 
THAT THE C. I. A. WAS STILL SAYING THAT THE THE DAMAGE BY THE IRAQIS WAS NOT AS GREAT AS YOU SAID 
AND YOU WRITE IF WE HAD WANTED TO CONVINCE THE C. I. A. WE WOULD STILL BE SITTING IN SAUDI WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE C. I. A. 
I HOPE YOU RECOGNIZE THE TONGUE IN CHEEK NATURE OF THAT COMMENT 
NO I DIDN'T 
YOU KNOW MY DISCUSSION OF THE C. I. A. WAS ONLY IN THE VERY VERY SMALL WORLD THAT I WAS LOOKING IN NOT IN THE ENTIRE 
BUT IN YOUR SMALL WORLD THEY WEREN'T TOO EFFECTIVE 
THEY DID NOT HELP ME AS A AS A THEATER COMMANDER AS MUCH I FELT THEY COULD HAVE 
WHAT YOU DID FEEL ONE OF YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE WAR WAS THAT YOU GOT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS FROM WASHINGTON ALMOST EVERY DAY 
YOU WRITE DECISIONS IN WASHINGTON WOULD BE MOTIVATED MORE BY POLITICS THAN BY MILITARY REALITY 
I WORRIED ABOUT THAT OKAY 
I KNEW THAT WASHINGTON HAD ITS OWN HANDS FULL WITH GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM THE CONGRESS AND THAT SORT OF THING 
BUT MY JOB WAS TO LOOK AT MATTERS PURELY AS THE MILITARY COMMANDER IN THE FIELD AND THAT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOB TO WORRY ABOUT THAT OTHER STUFF 
BUT YOU TALK ABOUT THE HAWKS ESPECIALLY THE HAWKS IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
YOU SAY THEY HAD A JOHN WAYNE MENTALITY 
THEY HAD SEEN TOO MUCH OF RAMBO THE HAWKS 
I SAID I WORRIED ABOUT THAT 
BUT MORE THAN WORRIED ABOUT IT 
AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME 
YOU SAID YOU WRITE ABOUT ONE WHITE HOUSE HAWK AND HE CAUSED YOU A BIG PROBLEM BUT YOU DON'T NAME HIM 
YOU'RE WRITING HISTORY 
YOU KNOW WHY I DON'T NAME HIM 
NUMBER 
BECAUSE I'M NOT TOO SURE OF THIS 
THINK IT WAS BRENT 
I DON'T KNOW 
I HAVE NO IDEA 
BUT IT WAS THE HAWKS 
YEAH BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TERM THAT WAS BEING USED 
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH GUY IT WAS 
BY THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON THAT WERE TALKING TO ME 
I MEAN THEY REFERRED TO THE HAWK BACK HERE AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE BACK HERE WHO WANT TO DO THIS 
AND IF YOU IF YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING FORCED TO DO SOMETHING MILITARILY THAT'S GOING TO KILL A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN IT THEN YOU HAVE AN OPTION 
THE OPTION IS YOU CAN BE REMOVED FROM YOUR JOB AND SOMEBODY ELSE CAN BE PUT IN THERE 
AND I WAS QUITE PREPARED FOR THAT 
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE REALLY DIDN'T MATTER 
THE PEOPLE THAT MATTERED WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY CHENEY AND COLIN POWELL 
AND THEY WEREN'T PUSHING YOU 
NUMBER 
BUT THE ONLY TIME I EVER FELT PUSHED WAS REALLY THAT THAT ONE TIME WHEN YOU KNOW WE WERE WITHIN DAYS OF LAUNCHING THE WAR AND THE WEATHER PEOPLE CAME IN AND SAID THE WEATHER IS GOING TO BE LOUSY AND MY MARINE COMMANDER AND SOME OF MY ARMY COMMANDERS WERE SAYING WE CAN'T GO IF THE WEATHER IS LOUSY 
AND I FELT OBLIGED TO REPORT THAT TO WASHINGTON 
OBVIOUSLY IT CAUSED THEM SOME CONCERN 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT YOU ENDED UP HAVING A SHOUTING MATCH WITH COLIN POWELL WHO SAID 
WELL 
WELL THAT YOUR WORDS YOUR WORDS 
IT WAS 
DON'T DON'T IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE BOOK AND NOW YOU'RE SITTING WITH ME 
NO I I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S PRESENTED IN THE PROPER CONTEXT 
OKAY 
YOU KNOW I FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT WHAT I WAS SAYING AND COLIN WAS UNDER AND I WAS UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE AND COLIN WAS UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TOO 
WHAT HE SAID WAS HOW AM I GOING TO GO BACK TO MY PRESIDENT WHO'S READY TO ATTACK NOW ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTH THAT HE HAS TO WAIT TWO DAYS 
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PUBLIC PRESSURE 
YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION 
SURE 
SO YOU HAD A BIG SHOWDOWN 
YEAH AND I SAID HEY BUT I HAVE MY COMMANDERS OVER HERE TELLING ME THAT THEY CAN'T ATTACK OKAY UNLESS THEY HAVE THIS AIR COVERED 
BECAUSE THE WEATHER IS SO BAD AND THEY WONT DO IT 
AND AND BUT IT WAS A FLASH IN THE PAN 
CAUSE BOTH OF US UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT THE OTHER ONE WAS SAYING WAS RIGHT 
OKAY 
SUPPOSE THE WEATHER HAD BEEN BAD AND COLIN POWELL OR WASHINGTON SAID YOU HAVE GOT TO GO ON THE TWENTY FOURTH 
WHICH MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED 
THE WEATHER CLEARED UP AND YOU WERE OKAY YOU WENT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH 
AND YOU KNEW THAT YOU WOULD LOSE THE LIVES OF MEN 
WOULD YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THOSE ORDERS AND ATTACKED ON THE TWENTY FOURTH 
I WOULD HAVE SAID I WANT TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT 
AND IF HE HAD SAID GO 
I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S TOO HYPOTHETICAL BECAUSE I CAN'T YOU KNOW BUT I WOULD HAVE I WOULD HAVE I WOULD HAVE INSISTED AT THAT POINT I WOULD HAVE FELT IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PRESENT DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHAT MY CONCERNS WERE 
NOT MY CONCERNS BUT THE CONCERNS OF MY COMMANDERS WHOSE LIVES OF THE TROOPS WERE IN THEIR HANDS 
WHAT WAS THE INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION IN WASHINGTON AND ON YOU 
WELL THE INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY WAYS AND IT WAS ALSO DISRUPTIVE IN MANY WAYS 
I TURNED OFF THE TELEVISION SETS IN MY HEADQUARTERS AND KEPT THEM OFF MOST OF THE TIME 
BECAUSE A GREAT DEAL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS COMING ACROSS THE TELEVISION SETS WAS VERY INACCURATE 
AND SOMEPLACE ALONG THE LINE IT MIGHT EFFECT CRITICAL DECISIONS 
SO I JUST WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM TURNED ON 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO KNOW 
RIGHT 
VERSUS YOU AS A GENERAL 
BUT THE ARGUMENT IS BEING ARGUED IN THE WRONG ARENA 
IT IS BEING ARGUED IN THE ARENA OF THE MILITARY VERSUS THE MEDIA AND THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM 
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME STATISTICS 
THE HEIGHT OF THE VIETNAM WAR THE OFFENSIVE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE THAT OCCURRED IN VIETNAM THERE WERE EIGHTY REPORTERS IN THE COUNTRY IN SAUDI ARABIA WE HAD TWO THOUSAND TEN 
SECOND STATISTIC DURING VIETNAM EVEN A MAJOR BATTLE WHEN IT WAS REPORTED GENERALLY MADE IT ON TELEVISION OR OR OR IN THE NEWSPAPERS PROBABLY FORTY HOURS LATER 
WELL WE DIDN'T HAVE TAPE 
RIGHT 
AND OVER THERE IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS 
SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM 
HOW DO YOU MANAGE THIS HUGE NUMBER OF REPORTERS WHO WHO HAVE AN ABILITY TO INSTANTANEOUSLY REPORT WHAT THEY SEE AND THOSE REPORTS GO INTO YOUR HEADQUARTERS 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
WHAT ABOUT REPORTING FROM ENEMY TERRITORY 
REPORTERS WHO ARE IN BAGHDAD 
WELL I HAVE A PERSONAL OPINION ON THAT 
AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN VIEWPOINT 
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU WHAT ONE DAY WE'RE ALLOWED TO GO BACK IN THEY KNEW FULL WELL THAT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE REPORT REPORTING WAS ONLY WHAT THE ENEMY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO REPORT 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT REALLY BOTHERED ME 
IRAQ THEY'D BROADCAST FROM IRAQ AND THEY'D PUT A SIGN UP AND SAY THIS INFORMATION IS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN CLEARED BY THE IRAQIS 
THEN THEY WOULD BROADCAST FROM MY HEADQUARTERS AND THEY'D PUT EXACTLY THE SAME DISCLAIMER ON IT 
IT MADE IT LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL COMMAND 
YOU WERE JUST AS BAD AS THE ENEMY 
IS JUST AS BAD AS THE ENEMY BY GOLLY YOU KNOW ONLY ALLOWING IT 
WHICH YOU KNOW AFTER AWHILE IT BOTHERS YOU 
AGAIN AND I'M NOT ACCUSING ANYBODY OF ANYTHING 
BUT I AM SAYING IN WORLD WAR TWO PEOPLE THAT DID THAT WENT TO JAIL AFTERWARDS TOKYO ROSE LORD HAW HAW ACCESS SALLY 
BUT THEY WERE DOING IT DELIBERATELY HELPING THE ENEMY 
WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS THEY WERE BROADCASTING ENEMY PROPAGANDA 
NOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE IRAQIS WERE GOING TO ALLOW ONE STORY OUT THAT WASN'T TO THEIR IN THEIR FAVOR 
I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THIS UP 
YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE REPORTERS WHO WERE IN BAGHDAD SHOULD HAVE GONE TO JAIL 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
OKAY 
I AM JUST SAYING THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF INSTANTANEOUS MEDIA THAT IS GOING TO IMPACT DECISION MAKING IN THE WORLD 
IT'S A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
WHAT ABOUT THE REPORTS WHEN YOU HIT THAT BUNKER IN IRAQ AND THERE WERE CIVILIANS IN IT AND YOU SAID THAT THIS HAD BEEN A MILITARY OF MILITARY IMPORTANCE 
SURE THAT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT 
YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY 
WAS IT A MISTAKE TO BOMB IT 
NUMBER 
IT WASN'T A MISTAKE AT ALL TO BOMB IT 
IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON OUR TARGET LIST 
IT HAD BEEN ON OUR TARGET LIST 
THE INTELLIGENCE WE HAD THAT IT WAS AN OPERATING MILITARY HEADQUARTERS BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER 
AND AFTER THE FACT EVERY INVESTIGATION THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED SINCE THEN HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS IN FACT A MILITARY TARGET 
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE CIVILIANS THERE 
OF COURSE NOT 
OF COURSE NOT 
GENERAL OF COURSE THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS DID WE END THE WAR TOO EARLY 
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH DAVID FROST A MONTH AFTER THE WAR YOU SAID FRANKLY MY RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN TO CONTINUE THE MARCH 
WE COULD HAVE COMPLETELY CLOSED THE DOOR AND MADE IT IN FACT A BATTLE OF 
RIGHT 
YOU ALSO WROTE IN YOUR BOOK I WANT TO CONTINUE THE GROUND ATTACK UNTIL TOMORROW 
THAT'S THE WAY I WROTE THE PLAN 
ONE MORE DAY WE'LL BE DONE 
INSTEAD THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A CEASE FIRE 
RIGHT AFTER CALLING UP AND ASKING ME IF I COULD LIVE WITH THAT 
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HALF A DAY 
WELL MAYBE ONE MORE DAY 
HALF A DAY 
WELL HALF A DAY HE STOPPED IT 
WELL I WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT 
I HESITATED FOR A MINUTE 
I SAID WELL LET ME THINK ABOUT IT 
LET ME FACTOR THIS IN 
WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED ALL OF OUR MILITARY OBJECTIVES 
I HAD JUST COME FROM BRIEFING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND TELLING THEM WE HAD DESTROYED THE IRAQI MILITARY 
SO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE STOPPED RIGHT YOU KNOW TOMORROW MORNING OR TOMORROW NIGHT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE ULTIMATE CAMPAIGN WAS CONCERNED IT WAS THE SAME 
WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED ALL OF OUR MILITARY OBJECTIVES 
AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT LIVES ABOUT HUMAN LIFE 
I MEAN I GOT TO TELL YOU I WORRY ABOUT HUMAN LIFE BOTH ON THE ENEMY AND THE FRIENDLY SIDE 
A LOT OF IRAQI TANKS GOT AWAY A GREAT MANY OF THEM 
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN AWAY IF YOU HAD GONE ONE MORE DAY 
MANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY ANYHOW 
AND WE DESTROYED ALL THOSE TANKS THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND 
WE DESTROYED FORTY TWO DIVISIONS OF IRAQI FORCES DESTROYED THEM 
IS IRAQ ANY THREAT TODAY TO OTHER NATIONS 
NUMBER 
EXTERNAL THREAT 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
OKAY LET'S PUT IT IN ABSOLUTE TERMS WERE YOU IN TOTAL AGREEMENT WITH PRESIDENT BUSH TO STOP THE WAR AT THE TIME IT WAS STOPPED 
YES 
IN RETROSPECT DO YOU EVER THINK WE SHOULD HAVE GONE ONE MORE DAY OR TWO MORE DAYS 
HINDSIGHT BEING TWENTY TWENTY THS I I DON'T THINK I HONESTLY DON'T THINK IF WE HAD GONE ONE MORE DAY OR TWO MORE DAYS OR FIVE MORE DAYS THAT HISTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED ONE BIT 
COULD WE HAVE GONE TO BAGHDAD AND TAKEN SADDAM HUSSEIN 
WE COULD HAVE GONE TO BAGHDAD EASILY WE COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN SADDAM HUSSEIN 
HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO GROUND JUST AS HE DID DURING THE WAR 
HE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN 
HE COULD HAVE HIDDEN ALL OVER THAT COUNTRY 
BUT LET LET'S LET'S BE FAIR 
WHO WOULD HAVE GONE TO BAGHDAD 
IF ANYBODY HAD GONE TO BAGHDAD AT ALL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND GREAT BRITAIN 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANOTHER COUNTRY IN THAT COALITION THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO BAGHDAD 
THE COALITION WAS FRACTURED COMPLETELY 
AND FINALLY EVERY MEMBER OF THE ARAB WORLD TODAY WOULD BE CONVINCED THAT WHAT SADDAM HAD SAID WAS RIGHT THAT WE WERE THAT WAS REALLY A WAR BY WESTERN OF ISRAEL TO DESTROY IRAQ THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRAQ AGGRESSION AGAINST KUWAIT 
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO SAY BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN IS STILL ALIVE WAS THIS WAR WORTH IT 
OF COURSE IT WAS WORTH IT 
OF COURSE IT WAS WORTH IT 
AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MISTAKES THAT ALL OF US HAVE MADE IS TO PERSONALIZE THIS WAR IN THE FORM OF ONE HUMAN BEING SADDAM HUSSEIN 
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES 
WE HAVE ARABS AND PALESTINIANS SITTING DOWN AT THE PEACE TABLES WITH ISRAELIS 
THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE GULF WAR 
OUR HOSTAGES ARE HOME FREE 
THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE GULF WAR 
WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE ARAB WORLD WHO ARE SAYING HEY YOU KNOW MAYBE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA YOU KNOW ISN'T OUR ENEMY 
MAYBE THERE ARE MAYBE THEY ARE CAPABLE OF CONSIDERING PEACE IN THIS WHOLE AREA AND HELPING THE PEACE PROCESS 
IT'S ALSO THE RESULT OF THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION 
YEAH BUT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT WHAT CAUSED THE MODERATE ARABS TO GO TO THE PEACE TABLE WITH THE ISRAELIS 
OKAY WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS A VOICE IN ARAB POLITICS IS NOW IRRELEVANT 
NOT THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A GOOD GUY 
HE'S A BUM AND I WOULDN'T SHED A TEAR IF SOMEBODY WERE TO NAIL HIM TOMORROW 
THERE'S MUCH MORE GOVERNOR CLINTON'S DRAFT RECORD GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
THE GENERAL HAS STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT BOTH 
ALSO DOES HE SEE A FUTURE FOR HIMSELF IN POLITICS 
GENERAL SCHWARZKOPF HAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT ONE 
STAY WITH US 
GENERAL NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF HE KNOWS WHERE HE STANDS ON SOME OF TODAY'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND INTERESTING QUESTIONS AND HE'S NOT AFRAID TO SAY SO 
FOR INSTANCE HOW DOES A CAREER ARMY MAN THE GENERAL WHO LED THIS COUNTRY TO ITS PROUDEST MILITARY VICTORY IN DECADES VIEW GOVERNOR CLINTON'S RELUCTANCE TO GO TO VIETNAM 
WELL BARBARA BEGAN BY ASKING IS IT NECESSARY FOR A PRESIDENT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY 
OF COURSE NOT 
WE'VE HAD LOTS OF PRESIDENTS THAT HAVE NEVER HAD MILITARY SERVICE 
IN MY MIND THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION 
IN MY MIND THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS A PRESIDENT GOING TO DO WHO FORMERLY OPENLY APPROVED OF DRAFT RESISTANCE AND RESISTANCE TO WAR GOING TO DO IF HE HAS TO ORDER PEOPLE TO WAR 
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO RESIST 
THAT QUESTION I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY ANSWERED 
AND THAT'S A QUESTION I HAVE ON MY MIND 
AND THE OTHER QUESTION 
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND I'VE SPENT THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE MILITARY 
I APPROACH THINGS AS A MILITARY MAN 
I SPENT TWO TOURS IN VIETNAM I HAD FRIENDS KILLED OVER THERE 
AND AGAIN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LOOKING TO THE PAST 
BUT TO MY MIND I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN REGARD TO GOVERNOR CLINTON'S DRAFT STATUS 
AND THAT DOES CAUSE ME A LITTLE BIT OF KNEE JERK CONCERN 
DOES VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE'S NOT SERVING CAUSE YOU SOME KNEE JERK 
OF COURSE YEAH 
DEFENSE SECRETARY CHENEY DID NOT SERVE 
I KNOW 
THAT GIVE YOU SOME KNEE JERK 
YES 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT POLITICS IN GENERAL NOW 
DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT WANT A POLITICAL CAREER 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
AND I'M TELLING YOU EVERY DAY AS THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON I FEEL STRONGER WITH THAT 
WERE YOU ASKED TO BE VICE PRESIDENT ON A COUPLE OF TICKETS 
YOU KNOW HOW TO ASK SOME VERY TOUGH QUESTIONS 
LET ME JUST SAY I WAS APPROACHED BY BY BY ALL THREE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS FOR THEIR SUPPORT TO GIVE THEM SUPPORT 
SPECIFICALLY FROM ONE OR TWO AS VICE PRESIDENT 
MY NAME WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OR TWO BY TWO AS A MATTER OF FACT AS A VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
CLINTON AND PEROT 
IT HAD TO BE IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
WELL I THINK THAT'S A LOGICAL CONCLUSION 
BUT I TOLD THEM THE SAME THING THAT I I TOLD EVERYBODY ELSE I'M 
I DO NOT WANT TO BE A PAWN IN A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN AND I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE YOU KNOW NOT TRYING TO INFLUENCE MY NOT TRYING TO USE MY SPECIAL POSITION TO TO TO DIRECT OTHER PEOPLE IN HOW THEY SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT VOTE 
I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS 
WHAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF LEADERSHIP 
I DON'T KNOW 
WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING TO FIND OUT TODAY AS WE TALK ABOUT 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT LEADERSHIP IS 
LEADERSHIP IS CONFIDENCE 
BUT FAR MORE IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP IS CHARACTER 
LEADERSHIP IS IS LEADERSHIP IS TAKING CHARGE BE WILLING TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY ACCEPT THE 
YOU LEARN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN DO WHAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S WHAT LEADERSHIP IS 
THERE'S ANOTHER VERY SENSITIVE POINT AND THAT'S GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
IT IS ALMOST THE LAST OVERT FORM OF DISCRIMINATION 
THERE ARE MANY GAYS QUIETLY SERVING AND DOING A VERY GOOD JOB AS YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S YOUR VIEW 
I'M OPPOSED TO IT 
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SO MANY SERVING 
NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT AT ONE TIME WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF MILITARY PERSONNEL AND MANAGEMENT I HAPPENED TO BE THE ARMY'S EXPERT WITNESS ON THE SUBJECT OF GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
OUR POSITION THEN WAS THEN AND IS NOW WHEN MEN GO INTO BATTLE AND FIGHT THEY DON'T FIGHT FOR GOD COUNTRY MOM AND HOMEMADE APPLE PIE 
THAT'S MAYBE WHAT GOT THEM TO THE BATTLE FIELD BUT GENERALLY IT IS THE UNIT COHESION IT'S YOUR BUDDY ON YOUR LEFT AND ON YOUR RIGHT AND AND YOUR NOT WANTING TO LET THE UNIT DOWN THAT CAUSES YOU TO REALLY END UP FIGHTING THE ENEMY WHEN THE ENEMY FINALLY COMES TO THE BARRICADES AND YOU TAKE THEM ON 
THE EXPERIENCE IN THE ARMY HAS BEEN THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAD AT THE TIME AND THAT'S THE ONLY EVIDENCE I KNOW OF WAS THAT WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPEN OUT OF THE CLOSET IF YOU PREFER THE TERM GAY OR GAYS WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION THAT FREELY ADMIT THAT WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION IT DOES TEND TO PULL ON THE ORGANIZATION 
IT DOES TEND TO BREAK DOWN THE COHESION 
SO IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF A PERSONAL SEXUAL EXPRESSION IT IS A QUESTION OF COHESION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ORGANIZATIONS FIGHT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY 
OKAY 
YOU MIGHT HAVE ENDED UP BEING CHIEF OF STAFF 
INSTEAD YOU DECIDED THAT EVEN IF YOU WERE OFFERED THIS YOU DIDN'T WANT IT WHEN YOU LEFT THE MILITARY 
HOW COME 
CHIEF OF STAFF MEANS YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN WASHINGTON D. C. AND DEAL WITH THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE PORK AND THAT SORT THING ON A DAILY BASIS 
AND I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I'VE BEEN STATIONED IN WASHINGTON D. C. AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT ANY ONE OF THE FIVE TIMES I WAS THERE 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW 
I WANT TO KEEP MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO MY COUNTRY 
HOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW 
YOU KNOW THIS BOOK IS COMING OUT AND THERE MAY BE THOSE CRITICS THAT SAY HEY THE GENERAL SPENT THE LAST YEAR WRITING THIS BOOK HE'S REALLY GOING TO CASH IN 
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION 
I AM NOT ON ANY DEFENSE RELATED INDUSTRY BOARD 
I HAVE I'VE BEEN OFFERED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE DEAL TO SELL ARMS TO MY ARAB FRIENDS USING MY SPECIAL POSITION WITH MY ARAB FRIENDS 
I TURNED IT DOWN 
I HAVE BEEN OFFERED NUMEROUS CORPORATE BOARD JOBS 
I HAVE NOT ACCEPTED ANY CORPORATE BOARD JOBS TO DATE EXCEPT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY 
WHAT WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO DO IF YOU COULD ANYTHING 
WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE 
YOU KNOW EDUCATION I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU EDUCATING 
IF I COULD I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME ROLE IN IMPROVING EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY 
BECAUSE I'M CONVINCED THAT EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO SO MANY OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS WE HAVE 
EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO PREJUDICE 
EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO DRUGS 
EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO CHILD ABUSE 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE COULD SOLVE THROUGH EDUCATION 
SO I WOULD LOVE TO WORK IN THAT FIELD IN SOME WAY 
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE AN UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR 
SURE 
I'D LOVE IT 
YOU'D LIKE THAT 
SURE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS BOOK YOU REVEAL THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC 
SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY PAINFUL FOR YOU TO DO 
WHAT AFFECT DID THAT HAVE ON YOU AS A CHILD 
WELL IT REALLY BECAME THE CONTROLLING FACTOR IN OUR LIVES 
I WOULD TELL YOU IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT STILL WITH MY FAMILY 
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I AGONIZED OVER MENTIONING IT IN THE BOOK 
BUT IT WAS SO MUCH A PART OF WHAT WHAT CAUSED ME TO BE THE PERSON I AM 
WHICH IS WHAT 
MAYBE MAYBE I LIKE TO CONSIDER MYSELF AS A SENSITIVE PERSON 
MAYBE IT GAVE ME SENSITIVITY 
I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS A COMPASSIONATE PERSON 
MAYBE IT TAUGHT ME COMPASSION 
AND MY MOTHER WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON 
I MEAN MY MOTHER WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON 
AND SO I DECIDED TO MENTION IT 
YOU KNOW IF IT ONLY HELPS ONE OTHER PERSON WHO MAY BE THE FAMILY MEMBER OF AN ALCOHOLIC SEEK HELP OR IF IT CAUSES ONE OTHER PERSON WHO IS AN ALCOHOLIC TO SEEK HELP THEN IT'S ALL WORTH IT TO ME 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS BOOK IS ALL THE HEADLINES ABOUT THE WAR 
IT MAY BE THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WHOLE BOOK 
I HOPE I DEARLY HOPE THAT A LOT OF THE OTHER STUFF THAT'S IN THE BOOK WILL WILL TURN OUT ULTIMATELY TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST THE BUSINESS ABOUT THE WAR 
THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE BOOK 
YOUR BOOK IS CALLED IT DOESN'T TAKE A HERO 
RIGHT 
SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU THIS ANYWAY HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED IF NOT AS A HERO 
IF I COULD WRITE MY OWN EPITAPH IT WOULD READ H. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF HE LOVED HIS FAMILY HE LOVED HIS TROOPS AND THEY LOVED HIM 
PERIOD 
THANK YOU GENERAL 
YOU KNOW HE SEEMED LIVING PROOF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BRUTAL OR CALLOUS TO BE A GOOD MILITARY COMMANDER 
WHAT'S WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO NOW 
WHERE DOES HE GO FROM HERE 
WELL I THINK HE'D LOVE TO BE A UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE PROFESSOR 
THERE ARE MANY UNIVERSITIES I THINK THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HIM AS THEIR PRESIDENT 
HOWEVER UNLIKE GENERAL EISENHOWER WHO YOU REMEMBER CAME OUT AND THEN WAS A PRESIDENT OF COLUMBUS UNIVERSITY AND WENT ON TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
GENERAL SCHWARZKOPF DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AN APPETITE FOR POLITICS AND HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A MAN WHO SAYS ONE THING AND DOES ANOTHER 
HAD HE ALWAYS PLANNED TO RETIRE 
OR DID HE RESIGN HIS COMMISSION ON A WHIM 
NO NO HE HAD ALWAYS PLANNED TO RETIRE AFTER HIS THIRTY FIVE YEARS 
HE SAID HE THAT WHEN HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WERE GROWING HE WAS NEVER THERE FOR THEM 
THEY WERE CONSTANTLY MOVING AND HE WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON AND HE'S A RELATIVELY YOUNG MAN AND THERE'S A WHOLE FUTURE AHEAD OF HIM 
WHO HAD OFFERED HIM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SELL ARMS 
AN INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANY TO SELL ARMS TO THE ARABS 
HE SAID NO AND IT DIED THERE 
HE'S ONLY ON ONE NON PROFIT BOARD THE NATURE CONSERVATION 
THANK YOU BARBARA 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM THE LATEST ON THE GREGORY K. CASE THE TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY WHO SUED HIS PARENTS FOR DIVORCE 
BUT FIRST THE PROBLEM WITH NEIGHBORS 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T ALWAYS PICK THE ONES YOU WANT 
AND JOHN STOSSEL FOUND NEIGHBORS FIGHTING LIKE CATS AND DOGS OVER THEIR PETS AND THEIR KIDS AND THE NOISE
