IN SOUTH AFRICA GUNMEN ATTACKED A SQUATTER COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF DURBIN EARLY THIS MORNING KILLING AT LEAST ELEVEN PEOPLE 
THE KILLINGS IN THE NATAL PROVINCE ARE BELIEVED TO BE PART OF THE LATEST VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE ZULU NATIONAL INKATHA FREEDOM PARTY AND RIVAL ZULUS WHO SUPPORT THE A. N. C. 
THERE ARE FEARS OF MORE POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE RUN UP TO NEXT MONTH'S DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS BUT THERE ALSO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PEACE 
NPR'S ANN COOPER REPORTS ON ONE PEACEMAKING EFFORT IN NATAL WHERE A VILLAGE QUARREL HAS BECOME A MICROCOSM OF THE LARGER WAR BETWEEN THE ZULUS 
THESE TWO PARTIES ARE ARE COMING HERE TO COMMIT THEMSELVES POINT NUMBER ONE 
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE ABOUT TO GET UNDER WAY IN A TINDERBOX REGION IN THE GREEN HILLS SOUTHWEST OF DURBIN 
SEATED IN THE OFFICE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN ZULU MEN ROUGHLY HALF OF THEM LOYAL TO INKATHA HALF TO A. N. C. 
THE MAGISTRATE A WHITE MAN LENDS AN AURA OF LEGALITY BUT IN FACT HE IS LITTLE MORE THAN A SILENT WITNESS AS THE ZULUS GROPE THEIR OWN WAY TOWARD RECONCILIATION 
THE PROTAGONISTS HERE ARE INKATHA AND A. N. C. PARTISANS FORMER NEIGHBORS WHO BECAME SWORN ENEMIES WHEN THE FIRES OF POLITICAL WAR SWEPT THROUGH THEIR SMALL VILLAGE OF IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE 
MORE THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A TOWN WITH ONLY ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES AND ANYONE SYMPATHETIC TO THE A. N. C. FLED THE SUPERIOR INKATHA FORCES 
NOW EVEN THOUGH THEIR HOMES WERE BURNED TO THE GROUND THE A. N. C. REFUGEES WANT TO RETURN TO 
ISAAC A PEACE OFFICIAL WHO HELPED ORGANIZE THIS MEETING SUMMARIZES THE CASE 
THEY SAY WE HAVE NO HOMES 
WE ARE NOT HAPPY TO STAY IN THE IN EXILE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES 
WE HAVE SPENT SIX YEARS STAYING IN THE BUSH BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET HOME 
PLAYS AN UNUSUAL ROLE HERE 
HE'S A MEMBER OF INKATHA BUT HE IS ALSO A NEGOTIATOR ON A LOCAL PEACE COMMITTEE ONE OF DOZENS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO TRY TO PLAY A NEUTRAL ROLE IN REDUCING POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
THE PEACE COMMITTEES ARE AS POWERLESS AS THE POLICE TO STOP THE LARGER WAR IN NATAL BUT THEY CAN SOMETIMES BROKER A HALT IN THE ENDLESS SPIRAL OF VILLAGE 
AT THIS MEETING THE A. N. C. REFUGEES FROM SPEAK FIRST 
THE LOCAL ZULU CHIEF IN THEIR AREAS HAS GIVEN HIS BLESSING FOR THEM TO RETURN HOME 
BUT SEVERAL INKATHA MEN IN THE VILLAGE HAVE RAISING FEARS THAT ANYONE WHO DOES GO BACK FACES MORE VIOLENCE 
WHEN THE INKATHA PARTISANS ARE QUESTIONED THOUGH EACH INSISTS THAT HE'S BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD 
ONE BY ONE THE INKATHA ZULUS APOLOGIZE AND TELL THEIR A. N. C. RIVALS THAT THEY ARE WELCOME BACK HOME 
IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE WORDS THE REFUGEES AGREE TO STOP THEIR BLOCKADE OF LOCAL BUS SERVICE 
THE A. N. C. TRANSPORT BLOCKADE HAS CLOSED SCHOOLS FOR MONTHS 
THE TRAFFIC DISRUPTIONS MAY BE THE REAL REASON WHY THE INKATHA HARDLINERS HAVE RELENTED TODAY ALLOWING THE MEETING TO END WITH A PEACE AGREEMENT 
A LOCAL TRIBAL OFFICIAL CHOPS WOOD FOR A BARBECUE TO CELEBRATE NEW PEACE 
A BUTCHER HAS DONATED A FEW SLABS OF BEEF 
AS THE MEN STAND EATING THERE'S LITTLE GIVE AND TAKE BETWEEN THE A. N. C. AND INKATHA PARTISANS WHO BROKERED TODAY'S DEAL 
STILL IT IS A RARE DAY IN NATAL WHEN MEN WHOSE FACTIONS ONCE SHOT AT EACH OTHER CAN SHARE A MOMENT AROUND A BARBECUE 
TODAY'S AGREEMENT SET NO DATE FOR THE RETURN OF THE A. N. C. REFUGEES TO 
HEAD OF THE LOCAL A. N. C. ORGANIZATION SAYS HE FEELS SAFE VISITING THE VILLAGE DURING DAYLIGHT BUT PROBABLY WILL WAIT A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE MOVES BACK TO 
HE SAYS HE IS WILLING TO GO BACK BUT DURING THE NIGHT HE WON'T BE HAPPY 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN AT NIGHT 
HE SAYS HE MIGHT DIE NOT KNOWING HOW IT HAPPENED 
SAYS THE A. N. C. WILL NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO CAMPAIGN IN THE VILLAGE FOR APRIL'S ELECTIONS IT'S TOO DANGEROUS WITH INKATHA RIVALS STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT WHETHER TO BOYCOTT THE BALLOTING 
THOSE WHO DO WANT TO VOTE NEXT MONTH WILL HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER VILLAGE ONE RULED BY THE A. N. C. IN THIS VIOLENT REGION WHERE EVEN THE SMALLEST HAMLETS ARE SEGREGATED BY POLITICS
