YOU KNOW BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN BEING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY 
IN TONIGHT'S SCIENCE REPORT C. N. N.'S MILES O'BRIEN SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON SOLAR POWER 
FOR MOST OF US IT IS SECOND NATURE 
WALK INTO A DARKENED ROOM AND FLIP ON THE LIGHT SWITCH 
IN NOVEMBER THIS REMOTE RESEARCH OUTPOST IN THE MIDDLE OF CALIFORNIA'S DESERT WAS THE FIRST TO RECEIVE SOLAR POWER IN A BOX TWO LARGE SHIPPING BOXES TO BE EXACT 
THE PORTABLE SOLAR POWER STATION INSIDE WAS INSTALLED IN ONLY TWO DAYS 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE TWO DAYS CAN MAKE 
IT'S BEEN LIKE A CHANGE FROM NIGHT TO DAY 
I MEAN IT GIVES US ONE HECK OF A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WHICH WE DID NOT HAVE BEFORE 
NOW RESEARCHERS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FACILITY HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH POWER 
THEY CAN WORK COOK AND READ WHENEVER THEY LIKE 
AND A NOISY POLLUTING DIESEL GENERATOR NO LONGER RUNS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DISTURBED WHEN THEY HAVE TO COME HERE AND LISTEN TO YOU KNOW DIESEL GENERATORS RUNNING ALL THE TIME 
THE NEAREST ELECTRICAL LINES FROM HERE ARE FIVE AND A HALF MILES AWAY 
ACCORDING TO A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ESTIMATE IT WOULD COST ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO BRING POWER IN HERE MUCH MORE THAN CAL STATE WOULD LIKE TO SPEND 
AND NOT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY DIGGING TRENCHES IN THIS ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA 
ON A GREAT DAY LIKE TODAY IT'D PROBABLY PRODUCE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND WATTS 
EDISON RESEARCHER NICK ENGINEERED THIS SOLAR SOLUTION 
THE PANELS FIT IN ONE SHIPPING CONTAINER 
BATTERIES WHICH STORE A FIVE DAY RESERVOIR OF POWER AND A BACKUP PROPANE GENERATOR FIT IN THE OTHER 
WE OPENED UP THE DOORS PULLED EVERYTHING OUT AND MUCH LIKE AN SET JUST HUNG EVERYTHING ON THE CONTAINER 
THIS PORTABILITY GREATLY REDUCES THE COST OF SOLAR POWER 
RIGHT NOW EDISON IS TRYING TO PROVE IT'S A RELIABLE VIABLE SYSTEM FOR ANYONE WHO ISN'T PLUGGED INTO THE POWER GRID 
AND SO THE WHOLE PACKAGE ENDS UP COSTING RELATIVELY MORE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD PAY FOR IF YOU WERE IN THE LOS ANGELES BASIN 
BUT THEN AGAIN IT'S A LOT CHEAPER THAN HAVING TO GENERATE IT YOURSELF OR TO BE WITHOUT ENERGY ENTIRELY 
THEY WON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE CAL STATE DESERT RESEARCHERS 
SIMPLE PLEASURES ARE NOT TAKEN FOR GRANTED HERE
