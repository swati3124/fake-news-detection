WOMEN ARE WISER THAN MEN BECAUSE THEY KNOW LESS AND UNDERSTAND MORE 
BEFORE YOU START WRITING IN LETTERS THAT INTERPRETATION OF THE WAS WRITTEN BY IRISH POET JAMES STEVENS BACK IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IN THE NINETIES THERE ARE OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 
CONSIDER THOSE OF ROB BECKER 
HE'S MARRIED HAS A NEW BABY AND A ONE MAN SHOW DEFENDING THE 
BECKER SAYS ONE SITUATION IN WHICH DIVIDE IS SHOPPING FOR A HOME 
MY WIFE AND I HAVE BOUGHT AND THREE HOUSES AND WE'RE STILL TOGETHER 
WELL SINCE YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING ON THE OBSERVATIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE WHEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE WERE SEARCHING FOR SHELTER DID YOU FIND THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHOP DIFFERENTLY 
WELL I KNOW THAT WE GO ABOUT IT COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY 
WE WALK INTO A HOUSE AND MY WIFE IMMEDIATELY NOTICES THE DETAILS OF COLOR CHOICES THE OTHER PEOPLE'S FURNITURE THAT'S IN THERE AND I IMMEDIATELY WANT TO KNOW HOW BIG IT IS 
I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE SIZE 
HOW MANY SQUARE FEET IS THIS HOUSE 
WE FOUND THIS ONE HOUSE 
IT WAS HUGE PLUS IT LOOKED LIKE WE COULD DO STUFF WITH IT 
WE COULD BUILD AND WE COULD KNOCK DOWN WALLS AND I LOVED IT 
AND SHE SAID BUT THIS HOUSE HAS BAD FLOW 
LOOK AT IT 
HERE'S THE DINING ROOM AND THEN WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GO AFTER THEY EAT I SAID I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY GO AFTER THEY EAT 
SHE SAID WELL LOOK 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE FAMILY ROOM TO GET TO THE LIVING ROOM 
THAT'S NOT GOOD 
YOU WANT TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN EAT AND THEN THEY CAN FLOW RIGHT INTO THE LIVING ROOM WHERE YOU'LL ENTERTAIN THEM 
I SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THIS HOUSE ARE WE SHE GOES NUMBER 
WELL WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS FIRST OF ALL WHY IS SIZE SO IMPORTANT TO YOU 
YOU KNOW SO YOU CAN SHOW IT OFF TO YOUR OTHER BUDS 
I WANT A BIG CAVE 
I JUST WANT SEE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT 
WHEN I WALK IN I SAY HOW MANY SQUARE FEET I CAN TELL HOW THAT COMPARES TO ANOTHER HOUSE 
I CAN'T YOU KNOW COMPARE THE DETAILS OF AND THINGS BUT I KNOW IF THIS HOUSE IS FIFTY MORE SQUARE FEET THAN ANOTHER HOUSE THAT'S GOOD 
YEAH BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS KNOCK DOWN SOME WALLS AND MAKE IT BIGGER 
OH ABSOLUTELY 
I LOOK FOR A PROJECT 
SHE'S LOOKING FOR A HOME 
I'M LOOKING FOR A PROJECT 
I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S WALL I CAN KNOCK DOWN IF I CAN GO UP TO THE ROOF AND ADD A SECOND STORY 
I ALWAYS WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THE HOUSE THAN WHAT IT IS NOW 
WHAT ABOUT THE BASEMENT 
IF IT HAS A BASEMENT THAT'S GREAT 
WE HAD A BASEMENT IN ONE OF OUR HOUSES AND THAT WAS JUST TERRIFIC 
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOWN THERE 
SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE JUST RELEGATED TO A FEW ROOMS IN THE HOUSE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ROOMS ARE O. K. 
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE WOMEN TAKE OVER THE HOUSE 
YOU KNOW IN THE CAVE TIMES IT REALLY WAS THE WOMAN'S CAVE 
IF YOU DO RESEARCH ON THAT YOU FIND OUT THAT THE WOMAN REALLY OWNED THE CAVE 
THE GUY WAS ONLY THERE AT HER LEISURE AND I SEE THAT NOWADAYS EXACTLY 
IT'S HER HOUSE 
SHE EVEN TALKS ABOUT IT THAT WAY 
YOU KNOW I SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT THE T. V. I WON'T HAVE A T. V. IN MY LIVING ROOM 
I SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT MY LIVING ROOM 
DO I HAVE A LIVING ROOM APPARENTLY I DON'T HAVE A LIVING ROOM 
I HAVE A GARAGE 
I HAVE A BASEMENT 
YOU KNOW MOST GUYS END UP IN THE GARAGE OR THE BASEMENT 
THE BATHROOM IS REALLY ABOUT THE ONLY PRIVATE PLACE I HAVE BECAUSE YOU CAN GO IN THERE AND LOCK THE DOOR GET SOME PAPER READING DONE 
BUT EVEN THEN SHE'S GOT THAT ALL MARKED OUT 
SHE'S GOT HER PERFUME OUT HERE 
SHE'S GOT YOU KNOW MAKE UP THERE 
SHE'S GOT IN THERE THAT I CAN'T USE 
YEAH 
I CAN NEVER FIGURE THAT ONE OUT 
DON'T USE THOSE WHY NOT THOSE ARE FOR OTHERS 
YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING 
I MEAN IS SHE SOMEONE THAT HAS YOU KNOW 
I LOVE TO NEGOTIATE 
OVER THE HOUSE PRICES 
I LOVE THAT 
I'M ALWAYS ONE TO WALK OUT AND THAT'S THE KEY 
YOU ALWAYS GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO WALK OUT 
SO YOU'RE THE BAD COP 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE FIND THE HOUSE WE LIKE AND SHE TENDS TO BOND WITH IT 
AND SHE WANTS THAT HOUSE AND I ALWAYS TELL HER LOOK WE GOTTA BE ABLE TO WALK AWAY 
SO WE GOTTA SET A PRICE AND SHE'LL HEAR ME ON THE PHONE SAYING WELL THEN FORGET IT 
TELL THEM WE'LL LOOK FOR ANOTHER HOUSE 
SHE GOES DON'T DO THAT 
I LOVE THAT HOUSE 
YOU'VE BOUGHT THREE HOUSES 
WE'VE BOUGHT AND THREE DIFFERENT HOUSES COMPLETELY THEM 
AND YOU'RE STILL MARRIED AND YOU'RE STILL TOGETHER AND YOU STILL LOVE EACH OTHER 
YEAH YOU KNOW A FRIEND OF MINE JUST WENT TO THIS SEMINAR CALLED HOW TO REDO YOUR HOUSE WITHOUT KILLING YOUR SPOUSE AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT TITLE FOR A SEMINAR 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN YOU THINK THAT THIS PERSON IS SOMEBODY THAT YOU AGREE WITH 
EVEN WHEN WE'VE DONE THE HOUSES WE BOTH AGREE 
HEY LET'S DO THIS IN SAY OUR FIRST HOUSE YOU KNOW SOUTHWESTERN WE WANTED TO DO 
LET'S DO THIS ONE O. K. GREAT 
HEY WE AGREE 
OUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BUT OUR PROBLEMS AREN'T SOLVED BECAUSE AGAIN YOU GO DOWN FOR THOSE PAINT CHIPS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S GOLD 
THERE'S INDIAN SUNSET 
THERE'S YOU KNOW WARM 
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLORS OUT THERE 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
AND YOU THINK YOU AGREE WITH THE PERSON AND YOU THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOWN AT THE HARDWARE STORE ARGUING OVER A FAUCET 
I DON'T WANT THAT FAUCET IN MY BATHROOM YOU'RE READY TO KILL OVER SOME FAUCET 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET NEAR YOU WHEN YOU'RE DISCUSSING LITTLE YOU KNOW DRAWER PULLS ON THE CABINET 
LOOK AT THAT DRAWER PULL 
IT LOOKS 
IT'S 
WE DON'T WANT
