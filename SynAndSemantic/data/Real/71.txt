ANOTHER U. S. COMPUTER MAKER ABOUT TO LAUNCH A SALVO IN THE JAPANESE MARKET BY OFFERING MORE COMPUTER FOR LESS MONEY 
COMPAQ COMPUTER TODAY WILL DRASTICALLY UNDERCUT PERSONAL COMPUTER PRICES IN JAPAN 
THAT MOVE COULD START A PRICE WAR IN THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER MARKET 
TODD BENJAMIN REPORTS FROM TOKYO 
COMPAQ ISN'T A HOUSEHOLD NAME IN JAPAN BUT THE HOUSTON BASED COMPUTER COMPANY WELL KNOWN FOR ITS AGGRESSIVE PRICING IN THE UNITED STATES NOW HAS ITS SITES SET ON JAPAN 
THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE JAPANESE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN PAYING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR 
SO I THINK IT IS FAIR TO OFFER THE BEST QUALITY PRODUCTS AT THE YOU KNOW THE BEST PRICE 
CHEAPEST MODEL IN JAPAN WILL SELL FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND YEN OR JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THAT'S ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE LOWEST PRICED MACHINE OFFERED BY N. E. C. THE MARKET LEADER 
COMPAQ ALSO THE COMPETITION ON OTHER P. C. MACHINES IT OFFERS IN HOPES ITS LOW PRICED STRATEGY WILL BE AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE WORD PROCESSING CROWD 
N. E. C. SAYS ITS PRICING WON'T BE AFFECTED BY MORE MACHINE FOR LESS MONEY MOVE 
JAPAN UNLIKE THE UNITED STATES HASN'T EXPERIENCED FIERCE PRICE WARS BUT COMPAQ COULD CHANGE THAT 
I DON'T THINK THE IMPACT OF THIS IS GOING TO BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY 
IT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS BUT YOU'LL SEE THE MARKET SHARES BEGIN TO DETERIORATE FOR THE JAPANESE MAJORS UNLESS THEY COME OUT WITH A VERY AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGY 
COMPAQ WHICH BEGAN SELLING PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN JAPAN EARLIER THIS YEAR HAS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF A MARKET VALUED AT FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS 
N. E. C. HAS OVER FIFTY PERCENT 
WHILE JAPAN THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER MARKET OFFERS MUCH PROMISE AGGRESSIVE MOVE INTO THE MARKET COMES AT A TIME WHEN MAKING SIGNIFICANT HEADWAY COULD BE TOUGH 
JAPAN IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND COMPUTER SALES ARE DOWN
