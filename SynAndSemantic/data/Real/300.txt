IN WASHINGTON TODAY THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION WAS TOLD IT HAD TO DO MORE FOR SOME OF ITS OWN 
A SUMMIT WAS HELD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF VETERANS WHO ARE HOMELESS THOSE WHO ONCE FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND NOW FIND THEMSELVES OUT IN THE COLD 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S JACKIE JUDD 
THE VETERANS CALLED THEIR PROTEST WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOMELESS HOMELESS VETS WHO WANT JOBS AND BEDS 
HEY WE ARE THE ONES WHO RISKED OUR LIVES FOR OUR COUNTRY 
AND WHAT ARE WE GETTING 
DO YOU GET THE SERVICES YOU NEED 
THEY MARCHED TO THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING HOMELESS VETS MEDICAL CARE AND LETTING THEM KNOW WHERE THEY CAN FIND SHELTERS AND OTHER SERVICES 
YET THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE SAYS RIGHT NOW THE V. A. DESPITE A THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET HAS NO COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO PREVENT VETERANS FROM BECOMING HOMELESS OR TO TAKE VETERANS OFF THE STREETS 
V. A. SECRETARY JESSE BROWN A VETERAN HIMSELF DOESN'T QUARREL WITH THAT FINDING 
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SAYING IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS HAVE BEEN AN ABJECT FAILURE 
WOULD YOU SAY THAT 
YES 
WELL YES 
THE PROBLEM SAYS THE G. A. O. REPORT IS TOO MANY HOMELESS NOT ENOUGH MONEY 
ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OF THE HOMELESS IS A VETERAN SOME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN ALL 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE AMONG THE HARDEST TO REACH BECAUSE SO MANY ARE MENTALLY ILL OR ADDICTED TO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL 
THE V. A. IS SPENDING SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESS VETS LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MAN 
AND ITS HOMELESS PROGRAMS REACH ONLY ONE OUT OF TEN OF THEM 
HOMELESS DESERT STORM VETERANS ARE SLEEPING UNDER BRIDGES AND EATING FROM 
THESE VETERANS ARE FIGHTING FOR DOLLARS IN AN AGE OF BUDGET CUTTING AND AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC'S TOLERANCE FOR THE HOMELESS IS DIMINISHED WHICH MEANS THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY OR THE CONVICTION TO LOOK AFTER ITS SOLDIERS
