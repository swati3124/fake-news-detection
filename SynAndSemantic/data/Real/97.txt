LIVE FROM WASHINGTON CROSSFIRE 
ON THE LEFT MIKE KINSLEY 
ON THE RIGHT JOHN SUNUNU 
TONIGHT THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE 
IN THE CROSSFIRE CONSUMER ADVOCATE RALPH NADER AND ATTORNEY LLOYD CUTLER 
GOOD EVENING 
WELCOME TO CROSSFIRE 
JUST ONE DAY AFTER PRESIDENT CLINTON'S LAVISH INAUGURAL HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE ZOE BAIRD HAS BEEN LOSING GROUND FAST 
TODAY BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SHE ADMITTED WRONGDOING IN EMPLOYING TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN HER HOME BUT SHE ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO JUDGE HER ON HER OVERALL CAREER RATHER THAN ON THE ONE MISTAKE 
I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT IT'S SMALL OR UNIMPORTANT 
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE POWER OF MY OVERALL RECORD AND THE POTENTIAL THAT I HAVE TO SERVE THIS COUNTRY AND TO SERVE THIS PRESIDENT AS ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD OVERRIDE THE PARTICULAR INCIDENT IN MY MIND 
THE ONCE TOUTED AS THE STAR AMONG THE CLINTON CABINET NOMINEES STATUS IS IN JEOPARDY TONIGHT 
SEVERAL SENATORS HAVE SAID THEY WILL VOTE AGAINST HER 
THE WHITE HOUSE REAFFIRMED SUPPORT FOR THEIR NOMINEE BUT IT REMAINED UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WOULD USE HIS MUSCLE TO FIGHT FOR HER 
DESPITE HER DISTINGUISHED RECORD AND STRONG COMMITMENT TO LEGAL REFORM WILL THE BAIRD NOMINATION BE THE FIRST CASUALTY OF THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
MIKE 
LLOYD CUTLER YOU WERE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL UNDER JIMMY CARTER 
ZOE BAIRD WORKED FOR YOU 
YOU THINK SHE'S BRILLIANT YOU THINK SHE'D MAKE A GREAT ATTORNEY GENERAL 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I THINK SHE'D BE A WONDERFUL ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WELL HERE IS THE PROBLEM 
THIS IS WHAT'S BOTHERING PEOPLE 
IT'S NOT VERY COMPLICATED 
BILL CLINTON RAN FOR PRESIDENT SAYING HE WANTED TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY BY THE RULES 
ZOE BAIRD BROKE THE RULES 
SHE ADMITS SHE BROKE THE RULES 
SHE ADMITS SHE KNEW SHE WAS BREAKING THE RULES 
HOW CAN SHE RUN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF ENFORCING THE RULES 
WELL ZOE BAIRD MADE A MISTAKE 
SHE'S ACKNOWLEDGED HER MISTAKE 
SHE DISCLOSED TO THE CLINTON PEOPLE AT THE VERY MOMENT SHE WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR A POSITION EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD DONE AND THE CLINTON PEOPLE DECIDED THAT WAS NOT A SUFFICIENT MISTAKE TO JUSTIFY PULLING BACK ANY PROPOSED NOMINATION 
SHE HAS PAID THE PENALTY FOR THAT MISTAKE 
SHE HAS 
SHE'S PAID A FINE 
SHE HAS PAID A FINE ALTHOUGH IT IS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST FINES LEVIED BY THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE IN THE CASE OF A DOMESTIC WORKER 
IT HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE SERVICE NOT TO LEVY SUCH FINES IN THOSE CASES 
IT IS A CIVIL FINE 
IT IS NOT A CRIMINAL DEFENSE 
HAVING PAID THAT FINE HAVING SHOWN THAT THE LAW IS EQUAL AND APPLIES TO HER I THINK SHE WILL BE IN JUST AS STRONG A POSITION AS ANY OTHER ATTORNEY GENERAL TO APPLY THE LAW FAIRLY TO EVERYONE ELSE 
BUT THE REASON SHE PAID THE FINE IS BECAUSE OF THIS CONTROVERSY BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN NOMINATED 
THERE'S BEEN A FLOOD OF LETTERS AND PHONE CALLS FROM THESE SENATORS I THINK THEY'RE VERY SURPRISED THE CLINTON PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED 
I'M SURPRISED I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY WE HAVE STRUGGLED HARD WE HAVE TO FIND PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS AND WE'VE DONE IT WITHIN THE RULES 
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THESE PEOPLE FEEL SO RESENTFUL 
I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE RULES ALL ALONG WOULD FEEL RESENTFUL 
THERE MAY BE MANY MANY OTHER PEOPLE PROBABLY TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIRED ILLEGAL ALIENS AND HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT 
YOU THINK MOST 
BUT THAT I GRANT YOU IS NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT ZOE BAIRD DID 
LOOK MANY 
AND ZOE BAIRD HAS PAID HER PENALTY AND WE'VE SHOWN THAT THE LAW APPLIES EQUALLY TO HER AS TO ANYBODY ELSE 
YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS ANOTHER JOB EVEN ANOTHER IMPORTANT JOB IN THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT NOT FEEL SO NERVOUS OR UNHAPPY ABOUT IT BUT NOT ONLY IS IT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHICH THE LAW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE 
HOW CAN SHE SHE PROBABLY COULDN'T GET HIRED AS A LOW LEVEL I. N. S. LAWYER WITH THIS THING IN HER RECORD 
HOW CAN SHE SUPERVISE THE I. N. S. 
I THINK HAVING PAID THE PENALTY HAVING SHOWN THAT THE LAW APPLIES EVEN TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DESIGNEE THAT SHE'S IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION TO DO THAT 
SHE'S IN THE POSITION TO APPLY THE LAW ANYWHERE TO ANY PERSON 
RALPH NADER YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IN FACT THE BASIC REASON THAT YOU OPPOSE ZOE BAIRD IS BECAUSE OF HER SUPPORT OF LEGAL REFORM WHICH WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR LAWYERS TO FILE THOSE COUNTLESS LAWSUITS THAT HAVE MADE US A SUE SUE SUE SOCIETY 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS THAT LEGAL REFORM 
WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT THAT NOMINATION 
THANKS FOR PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH JOHN 
WHAT SHE SUPPORTS AND WHAT HER COMPANY AGGRESSIVELY HAS GONE AFTER IS TO TAKE AWAY DIMINISH THE RIGHTS OF INJURED AND SICK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY HARMED TO HAVE THOSE RIGHTS TO GO INTO COURT FOR THEIR JUSTICE 
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S AFTER 
THIS ISN'T REFORM 
SHE ALSO SUPPORTS A HEALTH INSURANCE BRAND THAT MR. CLINTON DOESN'T AGREE WITH 
SHE SUPPORTS A COMPANY AETNA WHICH IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ANTI CONSUMER COMPANY IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 
SHE'S THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF AETNA 
SHE'S THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND SHE'S ALSO PART OF TOP MANAGEMENT AS SHE CAREFULLY TOLD THE COMMITTEE ON TUESDAY 
NOT ONLY THAT SHE WAS WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC WHICH IS A CRASS VIOLATOR OF LAWS AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL AND PROCUREMENT FRAUD 
SO THE FACT THAT SHE'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMERICAN PRIVATE SECTOR IS THE BIG BURDEN SHE CARRIES 
NO I WANT TO QUOTE LLOYD CUTLER WHO TOLD MARK GREEN THE AUTHOR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I WANT TO MAKE ONE THING CLEAR 
WE BELIEVE IN THE ARGUMENTS WE USE AND WE ADVANCE 
SO THE KEY IS SHE'S NOT JUST DOING THIS FOR THE MONEY 
IF SHE COMES UP BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND SAID LOOK I REPRESENTED ALL THESE ODIOUS POLICIES MANY OF WHICH ARE CONTRARY TO BILL CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN PROMISES BUT I WAS JUST DOING IT FOR THE MONEY THAT'S ANOTHER THING 
I THINK SHE BELIEVED IN WHAT SHE WAS ADVOCATING 
SO YOUR OPPOSITION HAS NOT DOES NOT COME FROM WHAT HAS BECOME THE HEADLINE SOURCE OF OPPOSITION NAMELY THE HIRING OF THE ILLEGAL ALIENS 
IT IS THAT SHE IS OPPOSED TO THE TRIAL LAWYERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND OPPOSED TO THE KIND OF REFORM THAT WOULD WEAKEN IF YOU WILL THE CAPACITY OF FILING LAWSUITS 
NOT AT ALL JOHN 
SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE 
YOU JUST SAID THAT 
THAT'S ONE REASON 
SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S DIVISION THAT SHE'S GOING TO SUPERVISE 
SHE BROKE THE LAW AND BY THE WAY NO ONE COULD BE EMPLOYED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT UNDER HER IF THEY BROKE THE LAW THE WAY SHE BROKE THE LAW 
LET ME ASK A QUESTION 
YOU'VE HELPED ORGANIZE OPPOSITION 
HAVE YOU GOT FOLKS CALLING IN THEIR SENATORS 
I DON'T HAVE TO 
THIS IS AN OVERWHELMING TOPIC OF OUTRAGE 
MY QUESTION IS HAVE YOU GOT FOLKS CALLING THEIR SENATORS 
NO I DON'T HAVE FOLKS CALLING THEIR SENATORS 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE CALLING THE SENATORS 
I AM URGING PEOPLE TO MAKE THEIR POSITION KNOWN BECAUSE BILL CLINTON YESTERDAY SAID HE WANTED 
ON THE TRIAL LAWYER ISSUE OR ON THE NANNY ISSUE 
ALL THE ISSUES HER LACK OF EXPERIENCE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS AND REPRESENTING CORPORATE ANTI CONSUMER AND ANTI 
HOLD ON 
LLOYD 
YOU'RE NOT USING THE NANNY ISSUE TO MASK 
LLOYD I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE NANNY ISSUE 
IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
I'D LIKE TO ANSWER WHAT RALPH IS JUST SAYING 
RALPH IS STIGMATIZING ZOE BAIRD BECAUSE SHE REPRESENTS CORPORATE AMERICA 
RALPH IS VERY MUCH AGAINST THE BEHAVIOR OF CORPORATE AMERICA 
HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH CORPORATE AMERICA CONTRIBUTES TO THE ENERGY AND THE PRODUCTIVITY AND THE JOB CREATION IN THIS COUNTRY 
POSITIONS ON TORT REFORM ARE SHE'S A DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION 
SHE'S IN FAVOR OF GREATER ACCESS TO THE COURTS 
SHE'S AGAINST CAPS ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR CAPS ON 
NOW SHE IS 
SHE HAS BEEN SHE HAS NEVER TAKEN ANY OTHER POSITION THAN THAT AND SHE TESTIFIED TO ALL OF THAT TODAY 
SHE PARTICIPATED IN THE QUAYLE COUNCIL 
LET ME GO BACK TO THE NANNY QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY GRIPS THE OTHER PEOPLE 
HERE'S ONE THING THAT TROUBLES ME AND I HAVE TO SAY I WOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR ZOE BAIRD AT THIS POINT BUT HERE'S ONE THING THAT DOES TROUBLE ME 
WHEN THIS THING FIRST HAPPENED SHE SAID WELL A LAWYER HAD TOLD HER IT WAS O. K. TO HIRE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN AS LONG AS YOU HAD AN APPLICATION IN 
NOW EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A LAWYER WHICH SHE IS THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL 
THERE WAS A HUGE CONTROVERSY WHEN WE PASSED THIS LAW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHICH MADE IT ILLEGAL TO HIRE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN 
IF YOU COULD GET AROUND THAT LAW SIMPLY BY PUTTING IN AN APPLICATION THE LAW WOULD BE NONSENSE 
HOW COULD ANY INTELLIGENT PERSON BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS LEGAL 
WELL LET ME SAY FIRST THAT THIS WAS THE ADVICE OF THREE DIFFERENT LAWYERS TO HUSBAND WHO'S A PROFESSOR AT THE YALE LAW SCHOOL 
AND HE'S A SMART MAN TOO AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW EITHER ONE OF THEM BELIEVED IT 
LISTEN FOR A MOMENT TO WHAT THE ADVICE WAS 
THE ADVICE WAS THAT WHILE IT IS QUITE TRUE THERE IS A CIVIL PENALTY APPLICABLE UNDER THE LAW AND IT IS UNLAWFUL A CIVIL VIOLATION UNDER THE LAW TO HIRE AN UNAUTHORIZED ALIEN WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT THE ALIEN IS UNAUTHORIZED THAT IN THE CASE OF DOMESTIC WORKERS HOUSEHOLD WORKERS THE PRACTICE OF IMMIGRATION LAWYERS AND OF THE I. N. S. WAS FOR THE IMMIGRATION LAWYERS TO FILE AN APPLICATION TO SPONSOR THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT IS TO CONVINCE THE LABOR DEPARTMENT THAT YOU COULDN'T HIRE ANYONE ELSE AFTER ADVERTISING AND THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PERSON AND THEN TO SPONSOR HER FOR A GREEN CARD AN IMMIGRATION WHICH WOULD MAKE HER A LAWFUL WORKER 
IF YOU DISCLOSED ON THE APPLICATION THAT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS ALREADY WORKING FOR YOU AND THAT IN DUE COURSE THOSE APPLICATIONS WOULD BE GRANTED AND THE WORK PERMIT HAS INDEED BEEN GRANTED ON THE BASIS 
BUT YOU CAN'T THIS ISN'T LIKE APPLYING TO SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE SURELY GOING TO GET AFTER A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME 
MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET THEIR APPLICATIONS GRANTED 
SO HOW COULD YOU THINK 
THAT'S QUITE WRONG 
MOST PEOPLE DO GET THEIR APPLICATIONS GRANTED IF THEY CAN SHOW 
BUT SHE IS GOING TO BE 
IF THEY CAN SHOW THAT AFTER ADVERTISING THEY CANNOT HIRE A QUALIFIED PERSON 
ALL RIGHT 
LLOYD 
THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE FOLLOWED THIS PARTICULAR PROCEDURE 
LLOYD DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER 
SHE ADMITTED 
SHE WAS WRONG 
SHE AND HER HUSBAND MAKE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
THEY COULD HAVE HIRED MARY POPPINS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE AND THERE'S NO THIS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE DRIVER HAD A LEGAL CONNECTICUT DRIVER'S LICENSE A RESIDENT UNDER CONNECTICUT LAW CANNOT HAVE A LEGAL DRIVER'S LICENSE 
HE'S DRIVING HER IN THE CADILLAC TO AETNA 
ALL RIGHT 
I'VE GOT TO CUT YOU OFF 
LLOYD YOU'LL GET ANOTHER 
YOU KNOW 
UNDER CONNECTICUT LAW THEY DON'T ASK NATIONALITY WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE 
ALL RIGHT 
HE WAS YOU'RE WRONG 
WE CAN'T KEEP GOING ON THIS 
WE'LL SETTLE THIS DRIVER'S LICENSE DURING THE BREAK 
WHEN WE COME BACK I'M GOING TO ASK WHETHER THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN NOMINEES IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE 
WELCOME BACK TO CROSSFIRE 
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S NOMINEE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL ZOE BAIRD BROKE THE LAW BY HIRING AN ILLEGAL ALIEN TO CARE FOR HER CHILDREN 
SHOULD THAT DISQUALIFY HER 
THAT'S THE DEBATE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HERE ON CROSSFIRE 
OUR GUESTS RALPH NADER WHO OPPOSES THIS NOMINATION AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE NANNY ISSUE AND LLOYD CUTLER ONE OF WASHINGTON'S LEADING LAWYERS 
HE WAS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AND ZOE BOSS IN THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION AND HE'S JUST ABOUT HER BIGGEST BACKER IN THIS FIGHT 
LLOYD CUTLER HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT BOTHERS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EXPLANATION FOR IT 
RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION ZOE BAIRD AND HER HUSBAND PAUL FIRED THIS PERUVIAN COUPLE 
ISN'T THAT SORT OF CRUDE 
NO THAT'S WRONG 
OH WELL CORRECT IT 
PLEASE CORRECT ME ON THAT 
ZOE BAIRD ORIGINALLY AND HER HUSBAND HIRED THIS PERUVIAN COUPLE 
THE HUSBAND LEFT THE WIFE 
THE WIFE WAS THE BABYSITTER THE PERSON WHO TOOK CARE OF THE CHILD 
RIGHT THE HUSBAND WAS A DRIVER 
WHILE ZOE WAS AWAY AT WORK 
THE WIFE WAS DEVASTATED BY THE DEPARTURE OF THE HUSBAND AND HAD DIFFICULTY PERFORMING HER DUTIES TAKING CARE OF THE CHILD AND THIS WAS ALL I BELIEVE BACK WELL BEFORE THE ELECTION I THINK I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN ABOUT THAT BUT IN ANY EVENT THE DEPARTURE WAS BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT BECAUSE THE BABYSITTER WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO PERFORM HER FUNCTIONS 
AND IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT SUDDENLY UNEXPECTEDLY THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY FOR AN ADMINISTRATION JOB BY ZOE BAIRD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
IT HAPPENED WELL BEFORE THEN 
ALL RIGHT 
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT 
RALPH THE REAL OPPOSITION TO ZOE BAIRD IS THAT SHE'S NOT LIBERAL ENOUGH FOR SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCIES AND SHE'S ACTUALLY BEING GONE AFTER ON A RUSE RATHER THAN GOING AFTER HER ON HER ISSUES AND POLICIES 
JOHN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY TROUBLED 
IT'S IN A SHAMBLES 
IT'S DEMORALIZED 
IT'S BEEN LED BY CORPORATE LAWYERS FOR MANY YEARS 
IT'S TIME FOR A PEOPLE'S LAWYER 
BILL CLINTON PROMISED A CLEAN SLATE A HIGH ETHICAL TONE PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST AND WHO DID WE GET FOR THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL DESIGNATE 
A CORPORATE LAWYER FOR GENERAL ELECTRIC AND AETNA TWO OF THE MOST RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE CORPORATIONS 
I KNOW LLOYD DOESN'T GET VERY DISTURBED ABOUT CORPORATE CRIME CORPORATE SAFETY HAZARDS 
HE FOUGHT TO DELAY AIRBAGS ON THE PART OF HIS AUTO COMPANY CLIENTS AND HE REPRESENTS PETRO CHEMICAL BUT I THINK IT'S KEY 
SO IT REALLY IS PHILOSOPHY 
IT'S PHILOSOPHY YOU'RE OPPOSED TO 
WELL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE KNOWN FOR AND WHERE DOES THAT PERSON COME FROM 
DID SHE HAVE A RECORD OF REPRESENTING FARMERS AND TENANTS AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND CONSUMERS AND WORKERS 
ISN'T IT REPREHENSIBLE THAT THE SENATORS DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO STAND UP AND SAY THEN THEY'RE OPPOSED TO HER ON PHILOSOPHY AND THEY'RE USING THIS ISSUE AS THE EXCUSE TO STAND UP AGAINST HER 
ABSOLUTELY 
PUT IT HERE 
I'VE CALLED THEM THE 
WELL I TAKE YOUR HAND ANYTIME RALPH BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU 
THE DEMO CAN PARTY 
WAIT A MINUTE 
ALAN SIMPSON 
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ABANDONED HER ON PHILOSOPHY 
THEY HAVEN'T ABANDONED HER 
THE KEY WITH CLINTON NOW IS WHETHER HE IS GOING TO HAVE THIS ALBATROSS AROUND HIS NECK MORE CALLS COMING IN MORE LETTERS MORE AND MORE 
GO AHEAD LLOYD 
RALPH YOU THINK OF CORPORATE AMERICA AS EVIL 
NUMBER 
THERE ARE LAWYERS 
I THINK OF CORPORATE CRIME AS EVIL 
CORPORATE CRIME IS 
AND CORPORATE POLLUTION IS EVIL 
OF COURSE IT IS AND I AGREE WITH YOU 
AND CORPORATE FRAUD 
AND CORPORATE FRAUD IS ILLEGAL BUT THERE ARE LAWYERS FOR CORPORATIONS WHO DEVOTE THEIR TIME TO IMPROVING THE CONDUCT OF CORPORATIONS 
NOT HER 
HER 
SHE 
SHE PUSHED TO WEAKEN THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT AGAINST GOVERNMENT FRAUD 
YOU'RE QUITE WRONG ABOUT THAT 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
SHE'S ON THE RECORD 
WHAT SHE PROPOSED ON THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT WHICH ALREADY SAYS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAS THE INFORMATION IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALREADY HAS THE INFORMATION THE INFORMER THE WHISTLE IS NOT ENTITLED TO ANYTHING 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE 
OR IF IT'S PUBLIC 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEBATE THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT 
LOOK LET ME JUST SAY THAT ALL THAT ZOE PROPOSED WAS THAT IF A COMPANY HAD FOLLOWED THE VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND HAD ALREADY INFORMED THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF THE WRONGDOING AND MADE A FULL DISCLOSURE ANY WHISTLE WHO FILED A LAWSUIT AFTER THAT SHOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO A SHARE OF THE 
WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK ON THIS ONE 
THAT'S ALL 
RALPH LET ME ASK YOU THIS 
IF HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN NOMINATED UNDER EXACTLY THE SAME CONDITIONS DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT HE'D BE GETTING THE SAME KIND OF OPPOSITION THAT SHE IS 
ISN'T THERE A LOT OF ANTI WOMAN DISCRIMINATION IN THIS WHOLE THING 
NOT AT ALL 
SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM AND FIVE WOMEN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAVE COME OUT AGAINST HER 
BARBARA JORDAN HAS COME OUT AGAINST HER 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACCUSE THE WASHINGTON POST AND THE NEW YORK TIMES EDITORIALS AS BEING SEXIST 
DO YOU THINK HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED THE SAME WAY 
ABSOLUTELY AND HE MAY BE WHEN HE COMES UP TO TESTIFY 
THEY DO AGREE ON CERTAIN THINGS 
BOTH OF THEM AGREE THAT THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT TO PROTECT AGAINST FRAUD 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT RALPH 
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
WHY NOT 
I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS IT 
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
SHE REPRESENTED THAT IN GENERAL ELECTRIC 
NO LET ME ASK LLOYD CUTLER BEFORE WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK 
WHY EVERYTHING ON THE 
REPUBLICANS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD HERE 
WHEN JOHN TOWER WAS UP EVERY LITTLE OF HIS WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE DEMOCRATS AND SAID THIS DISQUALIFIED HIM 
NOW THERE'S ACTUAL AND DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING WELL IT'S BAD BUT IT'S NOT A DEAL BREAKER 
IS THERE A DOUBLE STANDARD 
THERE ARE MANY MANY CASES OF CABINET NOMINEES JUDICIAL NOMINEES WHO HAVE COMMITTED ONE WRONG ACT IN THEIR LIFETIME THE LATE PAYMENT OF TAXES THE OCCASIONAL SMOKING OF MARIJUANA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LIKE GINSBERG WHO 
AND ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED 
GINSBERG DID NOT GET CONFIRMED BECAUSE HE FAILED TO INFORM THE PEOPLE WHO WERE APPOINTING HIM AND THE F. B. I. OF WHAT HE HAD DONE 
WHEN IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO AS A YOUNGSTER 
IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATION FROM ZOE 
WE'LL BE BACK TO DISCUSS 
AND AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR 
WE'LL BE BACK AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CONTINUE THAT 
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT HASN'T GOTTEN A BIT OUT OF CONTROL 
RALPH NADER A LOT OF FOLKS THAT GET ASKED TO SERVE ON THE CABINETS SAY NO WAY I DON'T WANT TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH THE KIND OF PROCESS THAT THOSE NOMINEES HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
HAVEN'T WE CREATED A SYSTEM HERE THAT KEEPS GOOD PEOPLE OUT OF GOVERNMENT 
NOT AT ALL 
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF GOOD PEOPLE WOMEN AND MEN WHO WOULD LIKE TO SERVE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO ARE ABOVE REPROACH WHO HAVE OBEYED THE LAWS THAT THEY WOULD BE ENFORCING AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IF THEY WERE PUT IN THAT POSITION 
ZOE BAIRD WAS TOUTED AS ONE WHO WAS GOING TO BE THE STAR OF THE CABINET 
LOOK WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW 
LET'S SEE HOW SHE ANSWERS QUESTIONS ABOUT A BOSTON PENSION SITUATION WHERE A BROKER GOT SECRET COMMISSIONS FROM AETNA IN RETURN FOR STEERING MONEY INTO AETNA INVESTMENTS 
SHE IS THE LAWYER ON THAT 
ALL OF THAT PRECEDED THE ACTIVITIES 
SHE'S IN RIGHT BUT SHE'S INVOLVED IN THAT NOW WITH A U. S. ATTORNEY 
O. K. 
SHE'S INVOLVED WITH THAT WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY 
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME 
I WANTED TO ASK LLOYD CUTLER ONE LAST QUESTION 
ZOE BAIRD SAID AT THE HEARING THAT WHEN SHE HIRED THESE ILLEGAL ALIENS SHE AS THINKING LIKE A MOTHER AND NOT LIKE SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE A NOMINEE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I'M AFRAID THAT REMINDED ME OF WHEN DAN QUAYLE SAID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THAT WHEN HE JOINED THE NATIONAL GUARD TO AVOID THE DRAFT HE DIDN'T REALIZE HE WOULD SOMEDAY BE STANDING THERE AS A VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE 
NOW WE ALL LAUGHED AND SCOFFED WHEN DAN QUAYLE SAID THAT 
ISN'T IT SORT OF SIMILAR 
WELL ZOE BAIRD WASN'T THINKING THAT SHE MIGHT SOMEDAY BE A NOMINEE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
HAD SHE BEEN THINKING OF THAT AT THE TIME 
SHE WOULD HAVE OBEYED THE LAW 
SHE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND ENDURED THE INABILITY TO FIND A COMPETENT BABYSITTER AT THE TIME SHE WAS TAKING ON THE BIGGEST JOB IN THE WORLD 
SHE IS A MOTHER 
THAT'S A FACT OF LIFE 
SHE CAN'T DEFEND HERSELF ON THE GROUND THAT AS A WOMAN SHE SHOULD BE EXCUSED WHERE A MAN WOULD NOT BE EXCUSED 
SHE CLEARLY WAS ASKING FOR SYMPATHY ON THAT BASIS WASN'T SHE 
SHE WAS STATING A FACT AND IN FACT IT WAS BROUGHT OUT BY DIANNE FEINSTEIN SHE INITIATED THE LINE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT SHE SAID I'M NOT ASKING YOU ABOUT THE LEGAL SITUATION 
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL AS A MOTHER 
ALL RIGHT 
THANKS VERY MUCH LLOYD CUTLER 
THANK YOU RALPH NADER 
I'LL FIND OUT HOW JOHN SUNUNU FEELS IN JUST A MOMENT 
JOHN I HOPE I WAS A VIGOROUS ADVOCATE FOR MY SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IN THE PAST HALF HOUR LIKE ANY GOOD LAWYER BUT I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG I DO NOT THINK IT'S A DEAL BREAKER 
I WOULD VOTE FOR HER IF I WERE A SENATOR FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S BEEN PRESIDENT FOR ONE DAY AND I FIND MYSELF AGREEING WITH YOU MICHAEL 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG 
WELL IT'S I'VE BEEN MEANING TO COMMENT ON YOUR SUPPORT OF EVERY SINGLE THING THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DOES 
IT'S GETTING RATHER 
I KNOW IT EVER SINCE HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE 
THE FACT IS IS THAT THIS PROCESS HAS BECOME PAINFUL 
WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG BUT WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE OPPOSING HER BECAUSE SHE'S TOO CONSERVATIVE NOT BECAUSE OF THIS NANNY ISSUE 
SOME PEOPLE ARE OPPOSING HER BECAUSE OF THIS TORT BUSINESS BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY UPSET ABOUT THE NANNY ISSUE 
THERE IS 
AND FURTHERMORE I THINK THE PROCESS IS FINE 
EVEN ZOE BAIRD WOULD SAY THE PROCESS IS HEALTHY 
IT'S BROUGHT THIS PROBLEM TO ATTENTION 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT IT WHO OUGHT TO 
FROM THE LEFT I'M MIKE KINSLEY 
GOOD NIGHT FOR CROSSFIRE 
AND FROM THE RIGHT I'M JOHN SUNUNU 
JOIN US AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT FOR ANOTHER EDITION OF CROSSFIRE 
PRIMENEWS IS UP NEXT 
HERE'S BERNARD SHAW TO TELL US WHAT'S COOKING ON DAY TWO OF THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
BERNIE 
THANKS VERY MUCH MICHAEL 
AHEAD MOUNTING CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE BUT ZOE BAIRD SAYS SHE WON'T PULL OUT 
GAYS IN THE MILITARY COULD BE THE EARLY BENEFICIARIES OF A CLINTON CAMPAIGN PLEDGE 
SOME IN CONGRESS ARE SAYING NOT SO FAST 
AND VICTIMS OF A FAILED INVESTMENT PLAN FIGHT BACK TRYING TO RECOUP THEIR LOSSES
