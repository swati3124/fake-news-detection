CHASE WORK HAS STOPPED AT THE SCHOOL PROJECT 
NOW HERE'S WHAT I KNOW 
THE SHAKEUP IN THE WAY WE COMMUNICATE IN THE COMING YEARS MAY BE AS AS WHAT ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL DID FOR US ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO 
BELL SURPRISED THE WORLD AND HIMSELF WHEN THE DEVICE HE CREATED TO AID THE DEAF FOUND A BETTER USE AS A TELEPHONE 
ITS BENEFITS WERE OBVIOUS EVEN THEN BUT NOT SO WITH CELLULAR 
WHEN A CHICAGO INSURANCE SALESMAN MADE THE FIRST CELLULAR CALL TO MR. BELL'S GRANDSON ON OCTOBER THIRTEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE NOT EVEN A TELEVISION CAMERA WAS ON HAND TO RECORD THE EVENT AND FEW INDUSTRY EXPERTS EVER THOUGHT CELLULAR WOULD CATCH ON 
THE EXPERTS PREDICTED NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND CELLULAR PHONES UP AND RUNNING IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE END OF THE CENTURY 
SEVEN YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THERE ARE THIRTEEN MILLION AND THE NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS 
WELL FOR ME IT'S THE CONVENIENCE OF A SMALL CELLULAR TO GO IN MY BAG AND TO JUST KEEP WITH ME AT ALL TIMES 
AND I THINK IT WAS THE EVOLUTION FROM A BUSINESS APPLICATION TO A CONSUMER APPLICATION WHICH REALLY PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE IN THE EARLY DAYS THE EARLY FORECASTERS DIDN'T SEE 
CELLULAR IS LIKE A POWERFUL WIRELESS RADIO DELIVERING YOUR CALLS NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE 
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS IT BECAME A MUST HAVE ITEM FOR SALESPEOPLE AND OTHERS WHO NEED TO WORK FROM THEIR CARS BUT OTHERS CAUGHT THE CELLULAR BUG IN WHAT'S BECOME A TWELVE DOLLAR BILLION INDUSTRY 
HOUSEWIVES TEENAGERS JUST ORDINARY PEOPLE LEAPED ON THE INVENTION AT HISTORIC RATES FASTER THAN FOR TELEVISION CABLE T. V. AND THE V. C. R. 
THE SAFETY REASON IS REALLY WHY I WANT ONE 
FOR SAFETY 
I JUST FEEL LIKE IN ATLANTA MAYBE EVERYWHERE NOW WE NEED IT 
OPINION POLLS TELL US PERSONAL SAFETY GREATER WORKPLACE EFFICIENCY AND CONVENIENCE HOLD THE BIGGEST APPEAL FOR CELLULAR PHONE USERS 
NEXT COMES SIZE 
FROM THE ONE THEY NOW CALL THE OLD BRICK HOUSE CELLULAR PHONES HAVE SHRUNK TO FIT IN A SHIRT POCKET 
WHILE THE COST OF MAKING A CELLULAR CALL REMAINS HIGH THE PHONE PRICES THEMSELVES HAVE DROPPED ALTHOUGH NOT SO FAST THAT WE CAN ALL AFFORD ONE BUT THAT DAY MAY BE COMING 
AS PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER FOR LESS MONEY AND THEY WANT TO BE IN CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NEAR AND CLOSE TO THEM THEY WILL MAKE IT SO THAT I ENVISION A WORLD IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS WHERE EVERYONE WILL HAVE THE CELLULAR PHONE 
AND PROBABLY A WHOLE LOT MORE LIKE PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS A LOWER COST LOW POWERED HYBRID OF THE CELLULAR PHONE AND MINIATURIZED COMPUTERS OFFERING PHONE FAX E. MAIL VOICE MAIL AND A PERSONAL ORGANIZER 
WHEN A CALL IS RECEIVED FREEDOM LINK ROUTES THE CALL THROUGH A CONFIGURATION OF BASE STATIONS WHICH SERVE AS INTERNAL CELL SITES 
THE CELLULAR INDUSTRY HAS CREATED SEVERAL OF OUR NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE 
SOME OF THEM FORESEE THE USE OF LOW POWERED PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE THE USE OF SATELLITE LINK UPS 
EITHER WAY THE OUTLOOK IS REVOLUTIONARY 
HELLO 
STEVE SORRY TO BOTHER YOU BUT BILL FREEMAN JUST CALLED FROM DALLAS 
HE'S GOT A SHOT AT ADVANCEMENT 
THEY WANT A MODIFICATION ON THE A TWENTY NINE 
HAVE BILL CALL ME 
MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT 
BILL WHY DON'T YOU GET US STARTED 
LET ME FAX THIS TO YOU 
WAIT A SECOND 
WON'T THE NEW A FORTY MEET THEIR WITHOUT A MODIFICATION 
BASICALLY WE'RE JUST TWEAKING THE ANGLE ON THE ROTATION ARM 
IT'S ONLY ABOUT A TEN DEGREE DIFFERENCE 
THANKS 
VIDEO TRANSFER READY 
O. K. 
NOW ON LINE 
IS REGULAR 
ON LINCOLN WAY 
UNIT FORTY TWO 
AMERICAN LANE'S ALL TIED UP 
FOLLOW ME WEST ON FOSTER 
TEN FOUR 
RIGHT BEHIND YOU 
THE BEST IS YET TO COME 
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WHOLE WIRELESS REVOLUTION IS YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET 
THERE ARE STILL SOME BUMPS IN THE ROAD AHEAD FOR CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY AMONG THEM ALLEGATIONS THE HAND HELD UNITS CAN CAUSE BRAIN CANCER 
SEVERAL STUDIES ARE NOW UNDERWAY TO SEE IF THOSE FEARS ARE JUSTIFIED 
YET IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS WIRELESS INDUSTRY THE TECHNO OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON SAT BACK DURING HIS SPECIAL PREVIEW A FEW MONTHS BACK AND HE SEEMED BY IT ALL 
I LOVE IT 
LORI WAFFENSCHMIDT C. N. N. FUTURE WATCH 
HERE'S ANOTHER SIGN OF WHERE THINGS ARE HEADING 
THE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY PREDICTS THAT BY THE END OF THIS DECADE SALES OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES WILL THE SALES OF THE ONES THAT WILL NEED TO PLUG INTO A WALL 
AND THAT PULLS THE PLUG ON US FOR THIS WEEK 
GLAD YOU COULD BE WITH US 
I'M LEON HARRIS IN FOR DONNA KELLEY
