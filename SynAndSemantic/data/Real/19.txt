HE WAS THE ASTRONAUT ON THE END OF THE ARM FOR THOSE LAST TWO TRIES THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL 
THIS IS HIS SECOND TIME IN SPACE 
HE FLEW ONCE BEFORE DURING FEBRUARY NINETEEN NINETY ON A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT MISSION 
RICK IS THE LARGEST ASTRONAUT OUT THERE

IN FACT THERE IS A STORY THAT GOES AROUND ON A PREVIOUS SPACE SHUTTLE MISSION WHEN HE WAS JUST AN ENGINEER AT NASA 
THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING IN A SATELLITE AND A YOUNG ENGINEER CAME RUNNING IN WITH A POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 
AND THAT SOLUTION WAS TRIED AND WORKED 
THAT ENGINEER RICK 
IN FLEW ON THE SHUTTLE 
THIS IS HIS SECOND FLIGHT ON THE SHUTTLE 
HE FLEW IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE MAY OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
THE THIRD ASTRONAUT OUT THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE PART OF THIS SPACE WALK 
TOM AKERS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON A SPACEWALK WITH CATHY THORNTON TO WORK ON SPACE STATION CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES 
HE IS FORTY YEARS OLD 
IN FACT HIS BIRTHDAY IS A WEEK FROM TODAY 
HE'LL BE FORTY ONE YEARS OLD A WEEK FROM TODAY 
HE WAS CALLED IN TO HELP OUT BECAUSE COMMANDER DAN SAID HE WANTED TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
AKERS HAS A MASTER'S DEGREE IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS

THOSE ARE THE THREE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING SPELL DOWN THERE 
YOU CAN SEE THEM OUT IN THE PAYLOAD BAY 
EACH ONE OF THEM ARE ON FOOT RESTRAINTS FOOT PLATFORMS 
WHO IS ON THE LEFT IT'S HARD TO TELL BUT HE IS ALSO STANDING ON A PLATFORM 
THEY EARLIER TODAY BUILT A LITTLE TRIANGLE OUT THERE WHICH PUT THEM ALL IN A TRIANGULAR SHAPE TO LATCH ON TO THAT SATELLITE 
THEY GRABBED IT AND WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS THE CAPTURE BAR 
HAS THE CAPTURE BAR FLOATING IN FRONT OF HIM 
YOU CAN SEE IF YOU LOOK DOWN IF YOU FOLLOW THE CAPTURE BAR DOWN TO RIGHT WHERE THE SATELLITE STRUCTURE IS YOU CAN SEE THE CIRCLE OF THE STEERING WHEEL THAT WE WERE WATCHING PIERRE THE LAST TWO TRIES WATCHING HIM HOLD TO TRY AND LATCH ONTO THAT 
THAT'S THE NEXT TASK IS TO PUT ON THAT CAPTURE BAR 
IN FACT LET'S LISTEN TO THEM FOR JUST A MINUTE 
YOU'LL NATURALLY JUST HAVE TO LEAN BACK OVER 
LET'S PUT THEM DOWN IN THE BACK AND PICK UP YOUR 
THAT'S GOOD OVER 
ONE OF THE CONCERNS BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO DO THREE PEOPLE WAS MICROPHONE CONTROL BEING ABLE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR EACH ONE OF THE ASTRONAUTS BECAUSE IT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING THE CAPTURE ITSELF 
THEY'VE NEVER USED THAT BEFORE 
AND SO THEY HAD TO WORK OUT A SYSTEM SO THAT EACH ONE COULD HEAR THE OTHER AND MISSION CONTROL COULD HERE THEM WITHOUT THEM STEPPING ON EACH OTHER 
THIS IS A VIEW FROM THE THAT WAS A VIEW FROM THE SHUTTLE'S ROBOT ARM LOOKING DOWN 
THERE YOU CAN SEE THE SIGHT OF THE EARTH A VIEW THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE GET TO SEE IN PERSON 
ASTRONAUTS ON THIS MISSION AS FORMER ASTRONAUT BILL FISHER SAID ARE NOT GETTING THE CHANCE TO REALLY LOOK AND ENJOY THE SUNRISE AND SUNSET OF THE EARTH BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BUSY FOR IT 
WHILE THE ASTRONAUTS GET IN POSITION AND CONTINUE WORKING PLACING THE CAPTURE ON OUR LIVE COVERAGE OF THE CAPTURE OF THE SATELLITE WILL CONTINUE
