FOR THE TENTH YEAR THE PRESIDENT IS ATTENDING AN ANNUAL RETREAT CALLED THE RENAISSANCE WEEKEND 
HE MANAGED TO PLAY A LITTLE GOLF ON THE ISLAND RESORT OFF SOUTH CAROLINA 
MR. CLINTON WAS ALSO SPOTTED ON THE BEACH NOT BUT JOGGING 
BUT HIS MAIN MISSION ON THIS HOLIDAY VACATION IS TO TALK AND TO LISTEN 
HERE'S C. N. N.'S JILL DOUGHERTY 
SUNRISE ON HILTON HEAD ISLAND LIKE BIRDS MIGRATING TO WARMER HUNDREDS OF THE COUNTRY'S MOVERS AND SHAKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HEAD HERE EACH NEW YEAR'S WEEKEND TO TALK AND TALK AND TALK SOME MORE 
IT'S TAILOR MADE FOR THE NATION'S FIRST TALKER A POLICY WONK WHO AFTER TEN YEARS IS MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AS PRESIDENT 
AFTER A MORNING JOG MR. CLINTON HEADED FOR A SEMINAR ENTITLED RISKING PEACE BOSNIA THE MIDDLE EAST AND WHAT REMAINS OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER 
HE'S A VERY RELAXED PERSON AND I REMEMBER MOST YEARS HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR USUALLY IN HIS BLUE JEANS AND A WORK SHIRT AND COMING AND GOING AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE OFTEN YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF OR FROM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE THAN HIS OWN 
LINDA AND HER HUSBAND PHIL THE PRESIDENT'S NEW DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOUNDED THIS SO CALLED RENAISSANCE WEEKENDS 
BETWEEN WALKS ON THE BEACH PARTICIPANTS CAN ATTEND SEMINARS RANGING FROM WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT LOVE TO LEAVE IT TO AND BUTTHEAD CONTEMPORARY VALUES AND THE MEDIA 
IT'S A HUGE BULL SESSION IS WHAT IT IS 
IT'S A HUGE CHANCE TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU USED TO DO IN COLLEGE 
THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO PLAY GOLF INSTEAD OF ATTEND A SEMINAR ENTITLED A CLINICAL VIEW OF THE CLINTON BUT HE DID HEAR THIRTY PEOPLE SPEAK AT A SESSION CALLED OH BY THE WAY MR. PRESIDENT MAY I SUGGEST 
BILL HILLARY AND CHELSEA CLINTON HAVE BEEN RENAISSANCE REGULARS FOR TEN YEARS 
OTHERS INCLUDE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES C. E. O.S MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REPORTERS AND SCIENTISTS 
THE EVENT IS BY INVITATION ONLY 
EVERYONE WEARS AN OVERSIZED NAME TAG WITH THEIR FIRST NAME IN LARGE TYPE 
EVERYONE THAT IS EXCEPT FOR THE PRESIDENT 
THE ORGANIZERS SAY THEY HOPE PEOPLE AS A SIGN OF RESPECT WILL CALL HIM MR. PRESIDENT 
BUT WITH A NAME TAG THEY SAY IT WOULD BE TO CALL HIM JUST BILL 
I THINK THERE'S A WONDERFUL SENSE OF BALANCE AND AND BOTH A RESPECT NOT ONLY FOR THE PRESIDENCY BUT PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY RESPECT FOR THE NEED FOR THIS FAMILY TO HAVE SOME PRIVATE TIME AMONGST THEMSELVES 
BUT PARTICIPANTS DENY THAT IT'S A FOR THE ELITE 
I LOOK AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO JUST EXPAND MY HORIZONS 
I DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING A TOUCHY NEW AGE INDULGENT THING IN ANY SORT OF WAY 
PERHAPS ONE OF THE BEST ATTENDED SEMINARS WILL BE ONE NEW YEAR'S NIGHT AT WHICH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IS SPEAKING 
THE SUBJECT WHAT I'VE LEARNED
