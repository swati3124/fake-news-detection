AT THIS HOUR PROSECUTORS ARE TRYING TO REOPEN THE CASE THAT SPARKED THE RACIAL RAMPAGE IN LOS ANGELES 
THIS TIME AROUND ONE OFFICER ACCUSED IN THE BEATING OF RODNEY KING WOULD STAND TRIAL ALONE 
PROSECUTORS WANT TO RETRY OFFICER LAURENCE POWELL ON THE CHARGE THAT DEADLOCKED THE FIRST JURY 
C. N. N.'S GREG LAMOTTE JOINS US WITH DETAILS ON TODAY'S HEARING 
GREG 
WELL SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE STANLEY WEISBERG WHO PRESIDED OVER THE TRIAL OF THE FOUR LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICERS ACCUSED OF BEATING MOTORIST RODNEY KING IS BEING ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WILL ALLOW A RETRIAL OF OFFICER LAURENCE POWELL 
HE IS THE ONE WHO INFLICTED MOST OF THE BEATING TO MOTORIST RODNEY KING 
POWELL'S DEFENSE IN ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN THAT HE SAID KING INITIALLY CHARGED HIM AND THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO USE HIS BATON AGAINST HIM 
HE SAYS THAT KING REPEATEDLY TRIED TO GET UP OFF THE GROUND AND IGNORED ORDERS TO GET BACK ON THE GROUND AND THAT'S WHY HE CONTINUED TO INFLICT HIS BATON BLOWS 
BUT THE PROSECUTION SAYS THE FORCE WAS EXCESSIVE 
THREE OF THE FOUR DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE WERE ACQUITTED 
BUT THE JURY DEADLOCKED ON THE ONE CHARGE AGAINST POWELL OF USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE 
NOW THAT HAS ALLOWED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO SEEK A RETRIAL IN THIS MATTER 
BUT EVEN THOUGH A RETRIAL IS BEING SOUGHT ONE OF THE FOUR ORIGINAL DEFENDANTS SERGEANT STACY KOON THE SUPERVISING OFFICER ON THE SCENE OF THE BEATING SAYS HE DOESN'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY THAT POWELL CAN GET A FAIR TRIAL 
THEY'VE ALREADY CONVICTED THIS MAN 
THEY AREN'T WILLING TO LET THE JURY SYSTEM WORK 
THEY ALREADY HAVE A VERDICT IN THEIR MIND IT'S PREDISPOSED TO GUILT 
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY UNTIL IT IS 
TODAY YOU READ IN THE PAPER I THINK IT WAS MR. MACK OR MR. HAD MADE THE STATEMENT THAT JUSTICE WILL BE DONE WHEN THEY'RE ALL GUILTY 
WELL SORRY THAT'S NOT THE WAY OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS IN AMERICA 
THE MOTION FOR A RETRIAL IN THE COURTROOM IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN AT ANY TIME NOW 
WE WILL BE BACK WITH LIVE COVERAGE WHEN IT BEGINS
