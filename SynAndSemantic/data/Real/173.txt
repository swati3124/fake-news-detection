PRESIDENT CLINTON IS OFFERING FEDERAL HELP TO FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES LEFT BY THE SWOLLEN MISSISSIPPI AND NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ARE NOW AT WORK IN THE FIGHT TO HELP CONTAIN THE RAGING WATERS 
IT IS THE WORST FLOODING IN THREE DECADES ALONG THE RIVER 
AS SHELTERS FILL WITH EVACUEES FARMLAND JUST KEEPS FILLING WITH MORE WATER AND AGRICULTURE EXPERTS PREDICT HUGE CROP LOSSES 
C. N. N.'S JEFF FLOCK HAS MORE ON THE MESS FACING RESIDENTS OF THE MIDWEST 
JEFF 
WELL BOBBIE NATALIE IT IS INDEED A MESS HERE IN HANNIBAL MISSOURI AT LEAST HERE ALONG SOUTH MAIN STREET 
WE PERHAPS CAN SEE SOME OF THE WATER DAMAGE ALREADY WE'VE GOT OVER HERE I DON'T KNOW BRUCE IF YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S THE AMERICAN RED CROSS WHO'S NOW FEEDING SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE DECIDED TO STAY AND WEATHER IT OUT 
YOU CAN SEE THIS HOUSE THIS IS MR. RAYMOND WHO WE TALKED TO A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY WHO HAS DECIDED TO STAY ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF HIS HOME 
I THINK YOU CAN QUITE CLEARLY SEE THAT THE FIRST FLOOR IS PRETTY MUCH AND HE HAS DECIDED TO STAY 
HE AND HIS WIFE AND HIS CAT ARE UPSTAIRS THERE AND THEY ARE GETTING PROVISIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEIR POWER IS OUT AND THEY REALLY HAVE NO OTHER MEANS OF EATING 
SO THAT IS THE SITUATION ALONG HERE 
LET'S TAKE A SPIN ON DOWN SOUTH MAIN STREET 
THIS IS THIS IS NOT NORMALLY SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE FROM A BOAT 
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IS QUITE A WAYS ON OUT 
COME ON OVER HERE 
WE'RE TRYING TO TALK TO SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN AND AROUND THIS AREA AND I WANT TO TALK TO A FEW OF THEM NOW 
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU SEE ALL OF THIS WATER WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE 
OH I THINK THAT THE FLOOD LEVEES SHOULD HAVE BEEN RUN DOWN THEY PROTECTED ONE PART OF THE TOWN LEFT US OPEN FOR THIS 
OUR VIEWERS SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS A FLOOD LEVEE THAT IS PROTECTING MUCH OF HANNIBAL BUT THIS AREA IS NOT 
YES IF THEY WOULD JUST GET US SOMETHING DOWN IN HERE TO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ALL THE TIME 
YOU KNOW I CAN STRESS THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL IN JEOPARDY 
I MEAN WE ALL NEED HELP DOWN HERE 
CAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WATER RISING EVEN MORE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY 
AND IF THAT HAPPENS YOUR HOUSE IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE 
IS THAT RIGHT 
YES IT'S ONLY A FEW INCHES OF COMIN' THROUGH MY DOWNSTAIRS FLOORS NOW AND AT THE NEW CREST IT'LL GET IT 
YEAH 
THERE'S NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT I CAN DO ABOUT IT EXCEPT WAIT UNTIL IT'S OVER AND SEE WHAT'S WRONG 
I UNDERSTAND 
WE BROUGHT A FEW OF THE YOUNGER ONES OUT HERE

YES 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT 
WELL I THINK IF THEY WOULD JUST BUILD A LEVEE LIKE DOWN TO THE THIS WATER WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW 
YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BUILT THE LEVEE BIGGER 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A BIG OLD STEEL PLATE ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE 
I THINK IT SHOULD JUST BE A LITTLE LEVEE LIKE GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN FOR THE WATER WOULDN'T BE RIGHT HERE TODAY 
OF COURSE THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY YOU KNOW 
YEAH BUT WELL THEY'RE JUST THAT MARK TWAIN DOWN THERE 
THEY DON'T WANT NO WATER DOWN THERE SO WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE WATER UP HERE 
WELL THAT MAKES SOME SINCE 
OKAY BURT
