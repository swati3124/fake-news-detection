FROM THE TABLOIDS TO THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA MUCH IS BEING SAID ABOUT NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON 
BUT WHICH OF THESE TALES IS TRUE 
HER FRIENDS SAY NOT MUCH 
THEY OBJECT TO WHAT THEY CALL A DISTORTION OF NICOLE AS A WILD OR A DRUG USER OR A MOTHER 
AND ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT 
RON HARDY SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH NICOLE SIMPSON IN RECENT YEARS 
THE DAY AFTER THE MURDERS HE FOUND HIMSELF CLEANING THE BLOOD FROM HER FRONT WALK 
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WAS A BEARER AT HER FUNERAL 
AND TONIGHT HE WANTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT TO SHARE HIS INSIGHT AND MEMORIES OF HIS FRIEND NICOLE 
IN A MOMENT WE'LL BE JOINED ON THE PHONE BY ANOTHER FRIEND OF NICOLE'S KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH WHOSE NAME O. J. SHOUTED ON THOSE INFAMOUS NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TAPES 
FIRST WE WELCOME RON HARDY 
HOW DID YOU MEET NICOLE RON 
I WAS INTRODUCED I'M IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS SO I KNEW HER THROUGH THOSE CIRCLES 
BUT CHRIS AND BRUCE JENNER INTRODUCED ME TO HER 
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS OF HERS 
AND YOU BECAME FRIENDS RIGHT AWAY 
RIGHT 
SHE ACTUALLY WHEN I MOVED TO BRENTWOOD SHE HAD MOVED INTO THE FIRST HOUSE SHE LIVED IN BRENTWOOD 
THIS WAS A FRIENDSHIP 
ABSOLUTELY 
DID YOU LIVE CLOSE BY 
ABOUT THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST HOUSE PROBABLY ABOUT A MILE 
AND THE SECOND HOUSE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS 
YOU KNOW O. J. PRETTY WELL TOO 
I MEAN I MET HIM THROUGH HER 
AND I DIDN'T REALLY SEE HIM A WHOLE LOT IN THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THINGS 
WHEN YOU MET HER WERE THEY DIVORCED ALREADY OR ABOUT 
THEY WERE SEPARATED 
SEPARATED AND ABOUT TO BE DIVORCED 
RIGHT 
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WAS SHE 
SHE WAS JUST A VERY DYNAMIC VERY FUN JUST LOVED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME KIND OF WOMAN 
I MEAN THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT I I LIKE TO BE WITH WHEN I'M NOT AT WORK BECAUSE I MEAN I RUN A CLUB AND I SEE EVERYTHING THAT COMES THROUGH HOLLYWOOD ALL THE TIME 
AND SHE WAS A PERSON THAT THAT IT WAS NICE FOR ME TO SPEND TIME WITH WHEN I WAS OFF WORK 
WOULD YOU SAY SHE WAS A NON HOLLYWOOD TYPE IN THAT REGARD OR NOT 
NOT NECESSARILY 
I MEAN SHE WAS YOU KNOW SHE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HER TIME BEING IN A HOLLYWOOD SITUATION 
BUT GIVEN HER PREFERENCES I THINK SHE ENJOYED NOT BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS BOOK COMING OUT MEDIA STORIES PICTURES TABLOIDS 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT 
IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE SHE WAS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT PART OF HER LIFE 
I MEAN THE LIMELIGHT PART OF HER LIFE WAS NOT THE PART THAT SHE ENJOYED 
AND SHE STAYED OUT OF IT QUITE A BIT 
AND IT'S IRONIC NOW THAT THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN MADE SUCH A CIRCUS 
I MEAN EVEN GOING TO COURT AND STUFF I MEAN ONE OF HER FAVORITE PASTIMES WAS SHE CHEWED GUM A LOT 
AND WE CAN'T CHEW GUM IN THE COURTROOM 
IT'S A VERY IRONIC SITUATION 
WHY DO YOU GO TO COURT EVERY DAY 
THE FAMILY ASKED ME IF I WOULD JOIN THEM IN THAT 
AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY CAN'T GO 
AND ALSO TOO I MEAN I I GO FOR THE GOLDMANS AS WELL 
THEY BOTH LIVE REALLY FAR AWAY 
AND THEY ASKED YOU TO BE A BEARER TOO THE PARENTS 
HER PARENTS DID YES YES 
DID YOU MEET O. J. AT THE FUNERAL 
I SPOKE TO HIM BRIEFLY YES 
WHAT DID HE SAY 
HE JUST HE HUGGED ME BRIEFLY AND TOLD ME YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR BEING HER FRIEND OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES 
BUT I MEAN HE SORT OF 
HOW DID YOU LEARN OF HER DEATH 
I WAS I HAD DINNER PLANS WITH HER THE NEXT DAY 
FOR MONDAY 
FOR MONDAY NIGHT 
AND THAT MORNING I GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER AND CHRIS JENNER CALLED ME CRYING 
SHE WAS HYSTERICAL BECAUSE SHE WAS 
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE LUNCH WITH HER RIGHT 
RIGHT 
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE LUNCH 
AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ME BECAUSE 
OH YOU MEAN THE OTHER PERSON DEAD THEY SAID RON 
AND MOST OF MY FRIENDS 
I MEAN MY FATHER EVEN HEARD ALL HE HEARD WAS A MALE COMPANION 
AND I HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OVER THE WEEKEND 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ME BECAUSE AND THEN WHEN IT CAME OUT THAT HE WAS IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS THAT HE LIVED IN BRENTWOOD AND HIS NAME WAS RON 
SO IT WAS CHRIS THAT TOLD YOU 
YES 
WHAT WAS THE FIRST THOUGHT YOU HAD 
I JUST I DROPPED LITERALLY I DROPPED TO MY KNEES AND I SAID ARE YOU KIDDING ME AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SHOT 
AND I I THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL 
AND EVEN BEFORE THAT I THOUGHT THEY SAID HIS EX WIFE AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS HIS FIRST WIFE 
I MEAN THAT'S JUST WHAT I THAT WAS MY FIRST REACTION 
DURING THOSE FIRST HOURS SHOCK OF COURSE THE DEATH OF A CLOSE FRIEND 
DID YOU AT ALL TIE O. J. TO THIS 
OR DID YOU THINK OF HIM AS IN CHICAGO AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
NO I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS BUT I I WONDERED WHERE HE WAS 
DID YOU THINK OF HIM EARLY REALLY 
MY FIRST REACTION WAS ONE OF YEAH WHERE WAS HE 
THAT HE WOULD DO THIS 
THAT GETS INTO A REALLY DIFFICULT AREA 
I MEAN I I'M NOT GOING TO LIE AND SAY I DIDN'T THINK THAT 
NUMBER 
THAT WAS PROBABLY MY FIRST REACTION 
THEREFORE DID SHE TELL YOU THAT SHE'D BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS OF A NATURE THAT WERE PHYSICAL 
RIGHT 
I MEAN I I HAD KNOWN OF THE EIGHTY NINE SITUATION AT NEW YEAR'S EVE AND I WAS OF THE FACT THAT HE HE HAD A POWER OVER HER IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW I SAW HER PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM OR YOU KNOW AFTER HE JUST LEFT I'D COME OVER AND SHE WOULD BE IN A CERTAIN MOOD 
I MEAN HE HAD 
YOU HAD TO CLEAN UP 
YOU CLEANED UP 
YEAH 
WHY YOU 
IT JUST IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT WAS THERE 
WE WENT TO THE HOUSE TO TRY TO GET SOME OF HER BELONGINGS TOGETHER 
AND HER RALPH HAD GONE OUT THERE AND HE SORT OF STARTED TO DO IT 
AND IT WAS IT JUST THERE WAS CAMERAMEN AND PEOPLE FROM YOU KNOW 
WHAT ARE WE WATCHING THERE 
THAT'S THAT'S HER BROTHER RALPH 
I MEAN HE STARTED DOING I MEAN THERE WAS PEOPLE TAKING PICTURES OF US DOING THAT 
I I SORT OF IN A IT'S A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY BUT THESE PEOPLE WERE WATCHING ME DO THIS AND I'M I MEAN THAT WAS THE LIFE THAT MADE MY FRIEND SPECIAL AND I'M HAVING TO DO THIS IN FRONT OF THESE PEOPLE FROM WHEREVER THEY WERE FROM 
AND I WISHED THAT ON EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM 
I LOOKED AT ONE OF THE CAMERAMEN AND I JUST SAID CAN I MAKE THIS EASIER FOR YOU 
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO YOU KNOW POSE FOR YOU OR SOMETHING AND HE PUT HIS CAMERA AWAY AND LEFT 
WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS 
DID YOU HANDLE MOVING ANY OF THE KIDS' FURNITURE 
YEAH WE MOVED PRETTY MUCH MOST OF THE STUFF OUT OF THE HOUSE ALL AT ONE TIME 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK AND COME BACK WITH RON HARDY 
AND WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL BE JOINED ON THE PHONE HIS FIRST APPEARANCE SINCE ALL OF THIS BY KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH 
FRIEND OF YOURS TOO RIGHT 
YEAH 
WHO WAS A ROMANTIC BOYFRIEND OF NICOLE SIMPSON'S AND WAS MENTIONED ON THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TAPE 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 
WE'RE BACK ON LARRY KING LIVE WITH RON HARDY AND KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH WITH US ON THE PHONE 
ARE YOU THERE KEITH 
YES I AM 
O. K. BEFORE WE ASK SOME QUESTIONS OF KEITH A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS I WANT TO COVER WITH YOU 
WHEN O. J. HUGGED YOU AT THE FUNERAL WAS IT A SHOCK TO YOU 
I ACTUALLY WENT OVER TO SEE A KID 
A KID SORT OF ME OVER 
AND IT WAS A BIT OF A SHOCK YEAH 
BECAUSE HE WASN'T CLOSE TO YOU OR 
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL 
BUT I MEAN I FELT I JUST WENT OVER TO SEE THE CHILDREN AND IT WAS JUST IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED 
I MEAN IT WASN'T A PLANNED THING 
WHEN THE CHASE WAS GOING ON I WAS SITTING HERE ANCHORING THAT CHASE 
I WAS IN WASHINGTON 
NEVER HAD AN EXPERIENCE LIKE IT 
WHERE WERE YOU DURING THIS SCENE 
I WAS AT I WAS AT ACTUALLY DURING THIS I WAS AT THE CONDO ALL DAY AND 
NICOLE'S CONDO 
AT NICOLE'S CONDO 
AND KEITH WAS AT MY HOUSE WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR 
AND FROM THE TIME IT TOOK ME TO GET FROM NICOLE'S HOUSE TO MY HOUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY FOUND HIM ON THE FREEWAY 
IT WAS A VERY BIZARRE TIME 
BOY THAT HAD TO BE CRAZY 
SO YOU WERE WATCHING IT ALL FROM NICOLE'S 
WELL YEAH 
I MEAN HE WE THOUGHT HE WAS COMING HERE SO I I CALLED NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN IN THE MORNING AND GOT SORT OF THE WHOLE THING STARTED I GUESS 
BUT IT WAS IT WAS INSANE 
KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH WITH US BY PHONE 
WHY HAVE YOU FINALLY DECIDED TO MAKE SOME SORT OF PUBLIC UTTERANCE KEITH 
WELL A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT NICOLE OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME AND BY RON COMING ON PROGRAMS AND TRYING TO SET THE RECORD A LITTLE BIT STRAIGHT 
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS TIME THAT I SPOKE A LITTLE BIT 
O. K. 
LET'S ASK SOME QUESTIONS 
O. K. 
HOW LONG WERE YOU ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED 
IT WAS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH NICOLE TWO OR THREE MONTHS ROMANTICALLY 
WAS IT SOMETHING KIND OF A LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 
WERE YOU ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER RIGHT AWAY 
IT WAS FOR ME 
AND FOR HER DO YOU THINK 
I BELIEVE THAT SHE CARED ABOUT ME 
AND WE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WE BECAME VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER 
A LOT HAS BEEN MADE OF THE ROMANTIC INVOLVEMENT BUT I THINK MORE SHOULD BE MADE OF THE FRIENDSHIP THAT DEVELOPED OUT OF THAT 
IF YOU HEAR SOME CLICKS THERE IS BAD WEATHER WHERE KEITH IS 
AND KEITH HAS BEEN BOMBARDED A LOT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHERE HE IS 
BUT THERE IS BAD WEATHER WHERE HE IS 
THE PRESS HAS BEEN AFTER YOU RIGHT KEITH 
YES THEY HAVE 
O. K. 
WHEN YOU MET HER THEY WERE SEPARATED BUT NOT DIVORCED 
THAT IS TRUE 
O. K. 
AND YOU ARE THE PERSON WHO WAS MENTIONED ON THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TAPE BY O. J. 
YES I BELIEVE SO 
YEAH 
HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL 
I WAS SHOCKED BY IT 
I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT UNTIL IT WAS PUBLICLY AIRED ON T. V. RECENTLY 
IN OTHER WORDS NICOLE HAD NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT THE INCIDENT 
NO SHE DID NOT 
O. K. 
WERE YOU SHOCKED WHEN YOU HEARD YOUR NAME MENTIONED 
YES I WAS 
BUT WAS IT TRUE 
WERE YOU WITH NICOLE IN A COMPROMISING POSITION THAT O. J. SAW 
WELL I'D RATHER NOT GO INTO THAT RIGHT NOW 
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW OTHER ISSUES IF I COULD 
BUT I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT ANYTHING AS FAR AS 
O. K. 
THIS IS NOT A COURT 
O. K. 
ALL RIGHT BUT YOU DON'T BUT YOU WERE ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH HER 
THAT IS 
YES I WAS 
ALL RIGHT 
AND YOU WERE CONFRONTED BUT YOU'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY ALREADY RIGHT 
YES I DID 
AND WILL YOU TESTIFY IN THE TRIAL 
THAT I BELIEVE IS UP TO THE PROSECUTION 
O. K. 
WHAT ABOUT NICOLE WE BEING LED WRONGLY 
I'M SORRY LARRY 
WHAT PUBLICLY IN THE TABLOIDS OR WHEREVER ARE WE GETTING TO BE THAT IS A MISREADING OF NICOLE 
ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE READ IN THE TABLOIDS IS MISINFORMATION ABOUT NICOLE 
NINETY FIVE PERCENT 
THAT WOULD BE MY ESTIMATE 
SHE WAS NOT THIS WILD CRAZY PARTY GIRL 
AS FAR AS THE ALLEGATIONS OF DRUGS AND CRAZY PARTYING IT'S JUST NOT TRUE 
AND ANYBODY WHO MAKES THOSE ALLEGATIONS OBVIOUSLY DID NOT KNOW HER 
I BELIEVE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SPURRED BY A DIFFERENT REASON OTHER THAN FRIENDSHIP TO COME FORWARD WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS 
WHAT REASON DO YOU THINK 
POSSIBLY MONETARY GAIN 
POSSIBLY PUBLICITY 
IT'S A MEDIA CIRCUS 
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT 
NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A BOOK COMING BY FAY REZNICK AND EVERYONE SAYS FAY REZNICK WAS VERY CLOSE TO NICOLE 
TRUE 
WELL SHE WAS A FRIEND OF NICOLE'S 
THAT'S TRUE 
BUT I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK OBVIOUSLY AND NOR WILL I. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE BOOK FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT THAT INTERESTS ME 
WELL IF SHE WAS A FRIEND MIGHT THE BOOK NOT BE VERY FAVORABLE TO HER 
IT MIGHT BE FAVORABLE 
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE TABLOID REPRESENTATION OF OF THE WAY THE BOOK IS GOING TO COME ACROSS I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE 
SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON IN 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE 
YEAH 
I MEAN IT'S I'VE KNOWN FAY A LOT LONGER THAN I'VE KNOWN NICOLE 
AND AND AND IT'S IT'S PAINFUL TO SAY BUT IT'S TRUE TO SAY I MEAN FAY IS A PERSON THAT HAD BASICALLY A TIMESHARE UNIT AT SEVERAL REHAB FACILITIES 
I MEAN AND FOR HER TO COME ON AND DO THIS FOR MONETARY REASONS I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT OTHER REASONS SHE WOULD HAVE FOR SAYING THE THINGS THAT SHE SAID 
AND I KNOW 
DO YOU LIKE FAY 
SHE'S BEEN ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS UP UNTIL RECENTLY 
AND THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER AND OTHER CLOSE FRIENDS HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER MEANS THAT SHE IS GOING ABOUT THIS WITHOUT OUR WITHOUT OUR APPROVAL 
YOU AND KEITH ARE FRIENDS 
YEAH VERY 
NOW KEITH YOU'RE COMING FORWARD BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT MOSTLY ABOUT NICOLE RIGHT 
ABSOLUTELY 
THERE IS THERE IS ONE TABLOID REPORT THAT I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON IF THAT'S O. K. 
GO RIGHT AHEAD 
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO SOME PICTURES CAME OUT IN THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER WHICH DEPICTED MYSELF AND ANOTHER FRIEND OF NICOLE'S IN WHAT PEOPLE CONSIDER A COMPROMISING POSITION 
THERE IT IS NOW 
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT NOW 
NOW YOU ARE WHERE 
YOU'RE 
I AM ON THE RIGHT ON YOUR SCREEN 
O. K. YOU'RE NEXT TO HER 
WHO IS THE GUY ON ON HER CHEEK 
HIS NAME IS BRETT 
O. K. 
AND HE'S HER BREAST 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS 
WELL THERE'S A LOT OF THE THING THE THING THAT SPURRED ME ON IS I HEARD A COMMENT ON T. V. THE OTHER DAY AND I'VE HEARD NUMEROUS COMMENTS IN THE PAST FROM PEOPLE WHO WHO APPARENTLY EITHER HAVE NOT SEEN THIS PHOTO OR HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO LOOK AT IT COMMENTS SUCH AS WELL SHE WAS SUCH A NICE LADY 
WHY HAVE WE SEEN THESE NUDE PHOTOS OF HER IN A HOT TUB WITH THESE GENTLEMEN AND IT'S JUST NOT TRUE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTO IT'S VERY CLEAR WE'RE SITTING WE ARE SITTING AT A BAR IN CHAIRS 
WE WERE FULLY CLOTHED 
I MEAN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF I HAVE NO SHIRT ON 
BUT YOU'RE IN CABO SAN LUCAS 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED FIVE DEGREES 
I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT GO TO THE DESERT TO BE FULLY CLOTHED 
YOU KNOW I'M IN A SUIT SHE'S IN A SUIT BRETT YOU CAN EVEN SEE IS WEARING A SHIRT 
WHOSE HAND IS THAT 
I'M SORRY 
WHOSE HAND IS THAT ON YOUR SHOULDER 
WELL IT APPEARS TO ME FROM THE THREE AND A HALF INCH FINGERNAIL THAT IT WAS CUT OFF OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND AND PLACED THERE 
IT'S A MAN'S THUMB 
AND WHO IS THE MAN ON NICOLE'S RIGHT OUR LEFT 
THAT IS BRETT 
AND WAS BRETT THERE 
BRETT WAS THERE 
BRETT WAS THERE 
WE TOOK A TRIP TOGETHER 
BUT HE DIDN'T FONDLE HER 
BUT HE'S WEARING A WEDDING RING 
BRETT NEVER WEARS 
THE FOUR OF US TOOK A TRIP TOGETHER 
NICOLE AND BRETT WERE SEEING EACH OTHER 
I TOOK ALONG A FRIEND A GIRL WHO I HAD RECENTLY MET AND INVITED HER ALONG AS A FRIEND 
THIS WASN'T A ROMANTIC TRIP FOR US 
YOU HAD NOT BEEN ROMANTIC YET WITH NICOLE THEN 
OH NO THIS IS AFTER I HAD 
O. K. 
SO BRETT IS DATING NICOLE AT THIS POINT 
BRETT IS DATING NICOLE AT THIS POINT 
BUT THIS PICTURE IS NOT 
AND ME AND NICOLE HAD ME AND NICOLE HAD BECOME VERY CLOSE FRIENDS 
SO WE DID TRAVEL TOGETHER 
WE DID SPEND TIME IN ASPEN TOGETHER AS FRIENDS 
AND WE WE WOULD GO OUT A LOT AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT NO HANDS TOUCHED HER 
I'M SORRY 
NO HANDS THOSE ARE FAKE PICTURES 
WELL IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY 
WHEN YOU'RE ON VACATION YOU CAN'T REMEMBER EVERY PICTURE THAT'S TAKEN 
WELL HE NEVER WORE A WEDDING RING 
I KNOW THAT 
I MEAN BRETT NEVER HAD A RING ON HIS FINGER AND HE DIDN'T HAVE A WOMAN'S THUMBNAIL THAT WAS THAT LONG 
PRECISELY 
AND IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE THUMBNAIL LARRY IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE THUMBNAIL ON THE LEFT HAND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A WOMAN'S FINGERNAIL 
AND BRETT I KNEW QUITE WELL 
AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE BRETT HAD FINGERNAILS THAT WERE IN THAT MANNER 
SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY IF THE PICTURE IS DOCTORED OR THE PICTURE IS NOT DOCTORED BUT IT SURE DOES LOOK SUSPICIOUS TO ME 
AND AS FAR AS THE ALLEGATIONS OF BEING IN A HOT TUB TO ME IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE SITTING IN CHAIRS 
THE FOURTH PERSON WHO WAS ALONG ON THE TRIP APPARENTLY THE GIRL WHO SOLD THIS PHOTO YOU'LL NOTICE SHE'S NOT IN THE PHOTO BECAUSE SHE TOOK THE PICTURE 
THE GIRL YOU WERE WITH 
SHE SIMPLY SHE SIMPLY STEPPED OVER AND SAID LET'S GET A PICTURE OF YOU THREE 
SO AT THAT POINT WE'RE SQUEEZED TOGETHER 
YOU CAN SEE HOW I'M LEANED OVER THE CHAIR 
YEAH 
TO GET MY FACE IN THE FRAME 
AND BRETT IS BEHIND NICOLE 
NOW WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE HANDS AFTER THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY 
YOU KNOW I DON'T REMEMBER ACTUALLY TAKING THAT PHOTO ITSELF 
BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PHOTOS OF THAT TRIP 
THEY SEALED NICOLE'S WILL TODAY FROM THE PUBLIC 
YOU AGREE WITH THAT RON 
I'M SORRY 
THEY 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH FANFARE AND ATTENTION TO THIS HER WILL WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC 
YEAH I THINK IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER 
DO YOU AGREE KEITH 
THAT THEY SEALED THE WILL 
YEAH 
OH I AGREE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT 
LET'S TAKE A BREAK AND COME BACK 
WE'LL INCLUDE YOUR PHONE CALLS 
THIS IS LARRY KING LIVE IN LOS ANGELES 
IN WASHINGTON TOMORROW NIGHT WITH A SPECIAL NINETY MINUTE EDITION THAT WILL INCLUDE THE FIRST EVER DEBATE BETWEEN GERRY ADAMS AND KEN OF THAT STRONG GOING ON IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND THE RETURN OF ROSS PEROT 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 
DON'T GO AWAY 
O. K. WHAT IS HE SAYING 
OH SOMETHING ABOUT SOME GUY I KNOW AND HOOKERS AND KEITH 
I STARTED THIS SHIT BEFORE AND AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT 
AND NOW WHAT AM I GOING TO DO GET THE POLICE IN ON THIS 
AND THE WHOLE THING 
WE'RE BACK 
BEFORE WE GO TO PHONE CALLS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR EACH 
HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OR SEEN THE KIDS RON 
I DON'T SEE THEM AS MUCH NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE BACK IN SCHOOL 
BUT YEAH I SAW THEM QUITE A BIT OVER THE SUMMER 
WHAT DO THEY KNOW OR NOT KNOW 
I THINK THAT THEY THAT THEY'RE AWARE THAT THEIR LIFE HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY 
BUT 
DO YOU KNOW IF THEY KNOW THEIR FATHER IS IN JAIL 
I KNOW THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD THAT 
WHETHER THEY KNOW IS YOU KNOW 
THEY'RE AT SCHOOL RIGHT 
YEAH THEY'RE BACK AT SCHOOL 
KEITH WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR LIFE SINCE 
OUTSIDE OF TRYING TO AVOID THE MEDIA AND THE PUBLICITY INVOLVED WITH THIS I'VE JUST SORT OF LAID LOW 
MY SOLE INTEREST IS IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT IF I'M NEEDED THAT I'M THERE 
I HAVE TRIED TO SUPPORT THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY 
I TALK TO RON QUITE A BIT 
I TALK TO NICOLE'S FAMILY QUITE A BIT 
BUT IF YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET THE MEDIA FOLLOWS YOU DOWN THE STREET 
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT BAD NOW 
IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING 
I WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE MY HOME FOR A PERIOD OF TIME INITIALLY WHEN SOME ARTICLES BROKE ESPECIALLY THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN TAPES CAME OUT AND PEOPLE SORT OF PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER 
LET'S TAKE SOME CALLS 
KEITH ZLOMSOWITCH WITH US ON THE PHONE RON HARDY HERE IN THE STUDIOS 
IOWA CITY 
HELLO 
HI LARRY 
HI KEITH AND RON 
I AM VERY VERY SORRY 
I WANT YOU TO HAVE MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES ABOUT THE LOSS OF YOUR FRIEND AND ALSO TO THE BROWN AND GOLDMAN FAMILIES 
I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU'RE AS DISGUSTED AS I AM WITH THE MEDIA TRYING THE VICTIMS AND BEING SO SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS SIMPSON 
AND ALSO DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS ALLEN SCHWARTZ IS 
IS HE REALLY A CLOSE BUDDY 
THANK YOU 
HE'S A FRIEND OF I DON'T KNOW HIM PERSONALLY BUT HE'S A FRIEND OF O. J.'S I GUESS 
AND NICOLE'S 
AND NICOLE'S RIGHT RIGHT 
HIS WIFE WAS A GOOD FRIEND 
I NEVER MET 
DO YOU THINK THE MEDIA IS TILTED TOWARD O. J. 
SURE 
SURE 
I UNFORTUNATELY YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS CASE AND JUST I MEAN HE IS A DEFENDANT CHARGED WITH A DOUBLE HOMICIDE 
HE'S NOT IN THIS SITUATION HE'S NOT A ROLE MODEL HE'S NOT A HERO HE'S NOT AN EX FOOTBALL PLAYER 
HE'S JUST THE DEFENDANT 
AND HE'S NOT GUILTY 
AND 
HE'S PRESUMED INNOCENT 
HE'S PRESUMED YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS 
BUT YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S FODDER FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO I GUESS 
AND IT'S THE BIGGEST STORY TO HIT EVER 
BY THE WAY YOU'VE WORKED YOU'RE CLOSE TO THEM 
HOW GOOD ARE THE POLICEMEN 
HAVE THEY BEEN YOU LIKE DO YOU KNOW FUHRMAN 
DO YOU KNOW 
I'VE MET I'VE MET DETECTIVE 
I KNOW HIS PARTNER A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
BUT ALL THE ALL THE DETECTIVES THAT I'VE COME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY THE PROSECUTION TEAM HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT BUT SENSITIVE CARING AND VERY VERY UNDERSTANDING 
WOULD YOU SAY THE SAME KEITH 
OH DEFINITELY I WOULD LIKE TO SECOND THAT THOUGHT 
THEY HAVE BEEN THEY HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY GREAT TO ME 
MARCIA CLARK AND THE REST 
EVERYBODY INVOLVED 
ESPECIALLY MARCIA 
SHE'S A SHE'S A VERY VERY WARM PERSON 
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT IF I COULD QUICKLY LARRY 
YEAH 
AS FAR AS THE QUESTION FROM THE LAST CALLER BY BEING DISGUSTED BY THE TABLOID TRYING OF NICOLE'S LIFE I THINK THAT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR 
SHE WAS AND ANYBODY THAT KNEW HER KNEW THAT SHE WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE BEST MOTHER THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN 
SHE DID EVERYTHING FOR HER CHILDREN 
EVEN ON THIS SUPPOSED TRIP TO CABO THAT PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT SHE WAS ON THE PHONE CONSTANTLY WITH HER KIDS MAKING SURE THEY WERE O. K. MORNING NOON AND NIGHT 
SHE DID NOTHING WITHOUT MAKING SURE THE CHILDREN WERE O. K. 
ASHLAND OREGON 
HELLO 
HI 
I'M SO GLAD THAT SOME OF NICOLE'S FRIENDS ARE FINALLY GETTING ON THE AIR AND ARE BEING ABLE TO DEFEND HER BECAUSE IT IS LIKE A SECOND DEATH WHAT SOME OF THE TABLOIDS ARE DOING TO HER 
MY QUESTION IS ISN'T IT FRUSTRATING FOR NICOLE'S FRIENDS AND FOR THE BROWN FAMILY AND THE GOLDMAN FAMILY TO HEAR SO MANY OF O. J.'S LAWYERS AND FRIENDS AND FAMILY COME ON THE AIR AND SAY HOW COMPLETELY INNOCENT HE IS 
AND YET NICOLE'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND RON'S FAMILY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT THEY REALLY THINK 
WELL THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SAY 
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT YOU THINK 
I THINK SO 
I MEAN DECORUM DICTATES THAT I WOULD NEVER YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK I SHOULD I SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN TRYING A PERSON WITHOUT WITHOUT THE 
ARE YOU HURT BY HAVING F. LEE BAILEY IS GOING TO BE ON THIS SHOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
DOES THAT BOTHER YOU 
SURE IT BOTHERS ME 
I MEAN IT'S BOTHERED ME FROM THE BEGINNING 
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE ONE OF THE LEAD COUNSELS WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST GOING OUT AND SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS YOU KNOW AND TALKING TO AFTER THE CAMERAS GO OFF HE SPEAKS TO THE PRESS AS IF YOU KNOW THEY WERE HIS FANS OR HIS 
BOTHER YOU KEITH 
YES IT DOES BOTHER ME 
AND IF YOU'VE NOTICED I'VE KEPT OUT OF THE MEDIA FOR THAT VERY REASON 
I'VE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY MY STORY TO TO TRY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT 
BUT I CHOOSE TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY WHICH IS IN A COURT OF LAW 
AND EVENTUALLY THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DECIDE THE FATE IN THIS THING 
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TO A LEVEL OF TABLOID JOURNALISM AND TRY TO SENSATIONALIZE THESE THINGS 
NICOLE DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT 
WE'LL BE BACK WITH SOME MORE MOMENTS AND MORE PHONE CALLS FOR OUR GUESTS ON LARRY KING LIVE
