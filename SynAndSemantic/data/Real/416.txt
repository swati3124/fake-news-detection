OWNERS AND PLAYERS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES LOSING MONEY 
AS THE STRIKE WEARS ON THERE IS ALSO A RIPPLE EFFECT 
CONCESSION WORKERS PARKING LOTS NEARBY RESTAURANTS AND THE STADIUM OPERATORS ARE ALL LOSING SOME MONEY 
JOINING US NOW IS THOMAS 
HE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GATEWAY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THE OPERATORS OF CLEVELAND'S NEW JACOBS FIELD 
SO WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH STUART 
YOU ISSUED BONDS TO BUILD THAT STADIUM 
THAT'S CORRECT 
CAN YOU PAY OFF YOUR BOND HOLDERS WITH YOUR REVENUE DOWN BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE 
YES WE WON'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR BONDS BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE FINANCED THE STRUCTURE 
IT'S A VERY UNIQUE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND THERE IS A TAX FROM PEOPLE SMOKING DRINKING THAT PAYS OFF THOSE BONDS PRIMARILY 
WHERE WE GET HURT IS ON THE OPERATIONAL SIDE REVENUES FROM UPSIDE WHICH WE WERE CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE IN CLEVELAND BECAUSE WE WERE GOING TO PUT AT LEAST THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE PARK AND THEN ALL THOSE FOLKS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RIPPLE EFFECT 
THAT'S THE IMPACT 
IT OCCURS TO ME DO YOU HAVE GROUNDS FOR A LAW SUIT BRINGING TOGETHER THE OPERATORS OF VARIOUS STADIUMS TO SUE SOMEBODY FOR THE LOSS OF REVENUE THAT YOU'VE GOT HERE 
I DON'T THINK SO 
WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT VERY CAREFULLY AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT WE DO 
IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD TRY TO RECOUP THAT BUT I'M AFRAID THIS IS JUST REVENUE THAT IS LOST FOREVER 
CLEVELAND HAS REALLY HAD A REBIRTH IN PART BECAUSE OF THE STADIUM 
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE WHOLE CLEVELAND DOWNTOWN AS A RESULT OF THE STRIKE 
ONE OF THE POSITIVE THINGS STRIKE WISE THAT WE HAVE THAT OTHER CITIES DON'T IS WE HAVE AN ARENA THAT IS COMING ONLINE TOO 
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THAT UP THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER 
SO SOME OF THAT SPIRIT THAT WE SAW IN CLEVELAND AS A RESULT OF THE NEW BALL PARK'S OPENING AND THE INTENSE INTEREST IN COMING BACK DOWNTOWN IS STILL THERE 
BUT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO BENEFIT FROM HAVE A REAL PROBLEM I THINK 
HAVE YOU PAID REFUNDS TO SEASON TICKET HOLDERS 
YES FOR THE TICKETS BUT THEY DON'T GET REFUNDS ON ALL THE PREMIUMS THAT THEY PAY FOR THINGS LIKE AND CLUB SEATS 
SO THEY'VE LOST MONEY IN FACT 
I MEAN THERE'S MONEY THEY PAID OUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ALL OF IT BACK 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE VALUE 
AND YOU'VE HAD TO SHELL OUT SOME MONEY AS WELL WHICH IS EVEN WORSE THAN YOUR LOSS OF REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE 
WELL THE CLEVELAND INDIANS HAVE HAD TO PAY THE COST OF THOSE TICKET REFUNDS NOT GATEWAY CORPORATION BUT THE EVERYBODY IS A LOSER IS THE BOTTOM LINE 
YOU WERE SAYING THAT SOME OF YOUR REVENUE COMES FROM SIN TAXES ON ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO 
HAVE YOU FOUND THAT ACTUALLY THE CONSUMPTION OF THESE THINGS HAS HAS GONE AND SOME OF YOUR REVENUE OR YOUR PROJECTION IS OFF 
YES 
ABSOLUTELY JANUARY 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY WHEN THE TAX WENT INTO EFFECT WE'VE SEEN A DECLINE PARTICULARLY IN SMOKING 
PEOPLE ARE JUST SMOKING LESS AND THE REVENUES ARE DOWN 
I THINK REVENUES HAVE FALLEN ABOUT FIVE PERCENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY WHEN THE TAX WENT INTO EFFECT 
WE WERE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE WAY WE DEALT WITH THE BONDS 
THE UNDERWRITERS MADE US BE THAT WAY SO WE WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT FROM THAT EITHER BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTRA REVENUE HAD WE NOT SEEN THAT DECLINE 
I MUST ASK JAN DO YOU SELL CIGARETTES IN THE STADIUM 
NO WE DO NOT 
DO YOU ALLOW SMOKING IN THE STADIUM 
NO WE DO NOT 
SO WE HAVE DESIGNATED SMOKING AREAS 
WAIT A MINUTE NO I DON'T CARE 
YOU NEED THE TAX REVENUE FROM CIGARETTES BUT YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO SELL THEM AND YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO LET PEOPLE USE THEM 
THAT'S A CONTRADICTION 
WELL IT WAS A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR US AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH BUT OUR FEELING WAS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THE COMFORT IN GENERAL AND IF THAT HAS AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE REVENUES SO BE IT 
IN AN OUTDOOR STADIUM THE FANS STILL WANT 
YES 
DID YOU POLL THEM 
DID YOU ASK THEM 
WE DID 
WE ASKED A LOT OF FANS WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SUBJECT AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE SITTING NEXT TO SOMEONE HAVING SMOKE BLOWING IN THEIR FACE 
FAIR ENOUGH 
THOMAS FROM THE GATEWAY CORPORATION IN CLEVELAND
