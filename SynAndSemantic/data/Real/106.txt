IT'S NOT JUST ANY HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL GAME HANGING IN THE BALANCE A REMARKABLE RECORD FOR A SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD COACH 
A VICTORY WILL PUT HIM IN THE RECORD BOOKS AS THE COACH IN U. S. HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY 
C. N. N.'S MIKE CAPPS LOOKS AT THE DRAMA UNFOLDING AROUND A MAN WHO HAS LIVED THE THRILL OF VICTORY AND MUCH MORE 
A SCENE REPEATED IN SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD RALPH LIFE FOR ALMOST FIVE DECADES 
BUT ON THIS SPECIAL NIGHT COULD SET A RECORD 
NOT ME 
I HAVEN'T WON ANY OF THEM MIKE 
I ASSURE YOU THAT I'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH LOTS OF WONDERFUL BALLPLAYERS 
WONDERFUL INDEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WON COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS 
HALF A DOZEN PLAYED PROFESSIONALLY 
EAGLES WON TWELVE NEW MEXICO HIGH SCHOOL CHAMPIONSHIPS UNDER RALPH 
RALPH IS MORE THAN AN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL BASKETBALL COACH 
FELLOW TEACHERS FORMER PLAYERS AND ASSISTANT COACHES CALL HIM A MASTER TEACHER A FATHER FIGURE AND A FRIEND 
AND A INSTITUTION 
THE BASKETBALL ARENA BEARS HIS NAME 
HE TEACHES FOUR SOCIOLOGY CLASSES A DAY 
HE'D PUT ASIDE THINGS FOR US JUST TO GET OUR STUDIES BEFORE WE TRIED TO PRACTICE 
WE HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SEVENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND TEACHING AS LONG AS HE HAS AND STILL DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP 
CALM AND DELIBERATE HOURS BEFORE THE BIGGEST GAME OF HIS LIFE READS HIS MAIL AND OVERSEES MORNING PRACTICE INDIVIDUAL SKILLS BUT TEAM COMES FIRST TO RALPH 
THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS 
IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF A CORPORATION OR A BUSINESS OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE DO YOUR PART AND NOT TRY TO GRAB THE LIMELIGHT 
TOOK HIS FAST PACED FULL COURT PRESSURE GAME TO PLAY OLD RIVAL LOOKING FOR VICTORY ONE THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN 
BUT THE GAME GOT OUT OF HAND EARLY 
CONTINUALLY DEFEATED PRESS

THEY WANTED NO PART OF IT 
PULLED WITHIN SIX IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BUT IN THE END TOO MUCH FIREPOWER
