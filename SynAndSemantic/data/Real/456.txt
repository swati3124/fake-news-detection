WELL LET'S CONTINUE WITH THIS TRILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE 
WHAT 
MEET THE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC CONGRESSMAN FROM COLUMBUS OHIO 
YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS GOVERNMENT WORKS 
FORTY TWO YEAR OLD JOHN KASICH WHO WILL BE THE NEXT CHAIRMAN OF THE VERY POWERFUL HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE 
MR. PRESIDENT IF YOU'RE WATCHING WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE US YOUR SPECIFICS 
JOHN KASICH ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HIS DAD WAS A MAILMAN 
RICHARD NIXON GOT HIM INTERESTED IN POLITICS 
KASICH IT RHYMES WITH BASIC HE SAYS NEVER MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO STATE THE CHALLENGE 
WE ARE LITERALLY MORTGAGING THE FUTURE OF YOUNG AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP HAVE THE COURAGE LISTEN TO WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT AND THEN LEAD 
JOHN KASICH IS THE MAN WHO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS PICKED TO MAKE GOOD ON THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS MADE IN THE REPUBLICAN CONTRACT WITH AMERICA 
THEY SAY HE'S VERY GOOD 
THEY SAY HE'S VERY SMART 
THEY SAY HE'S VERY ENTHUSIASTIC 
AND THEY SAY HE MAY NOT BE REALISTIC 
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE CUT THE TAXES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS' WORTH TAKE THE AX TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET BY TWO THOUSAND TWO 
THAT'S A TRILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING CUTS WHICH MR. KASICH HAS TO FIND 
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A TRILLION DOLLARS 
MR. KASICH LIKES THIS STORY 
CUTTING FEDERAL SPENDING IS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE GOING ON A DIET 
IF YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT IT'S PRETTY HARD TO CUT BACK ON THE FOOD 
BUT AFTER YOU DO YOU PUT THE SUIT ON IT FEELS GOOD BUT IT'S THE DIET THAT WE HAVE TO GET USED TO 
THE OLD HAND SENATOR WARREN RUDMAN WHO HAS NEGOTIATED BUDGETS IN CONGRESS FOR YEARS HOPES IT WORKS 
ON THE OTHER HAND 
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR TAX CUTS AND TALKING ABOUT DEFICIT REDUCTION AT THE SAME TIME I'M AFRAID THAT THOSE THINGS ARE GENERALLY INCONSISTENT TODAY 
BUT YOU HAVE TO BEGIN SOMEWHERE SAYS MR. KASICH 
SO HOW ABOUT MEDICARE FOR A START 
WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE DEDUCTIBLE ON MEDICARE PART A SO THAT WEALTHIER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CARRY A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE LOAD 
STUDENT LOANS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED 
WE'RE GOING TO SAY TO COLLEGE STUDENTS WHEN THEY GET THEIR STUDENT LOAN INSTEAD OF PAYING INTEREST ONCE THEY GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE THAT INTEREST IS GOING TO BEGIN ACCUMULATING AS SOON AS THEY GET THE LOAN 
PRIVATIZING PARTS OF GOVERNMENT LIKE THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION 
WHAT WE WOULD DO IS CREATE A PRIVATE NON PROFIT CORPORATION OWNED BY THE USERS OF THE AIRLINES 
AND WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES FOR AGRICULTURE 
WE KNOW THAT THE BIGGEST PART OF THE AGRICULTURE PROGRAM IS FOOD STAMPS 
THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM IS GOING TO GO UNDER SEVERE REVIEW 
IT IS A PROGRAM THAT IS FRAUGHT WITH WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE 
HE'S A THOUGHTFUL MAN JOHN KASICH 
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HELPING WORKING AMERICANS HE OFTEN REFERS TO HIS FATHER 
MY DAD CARRIED MAIL ON HIS BACK 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE AMERICAN LEGACY IS AS MY DAD SAID JOHNNY YOU'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF THAN I AM 
AND WHAT WOULD HIS FATHER WHO DIED SOME TIME AGO THINK OF HIS ENERGETIC SON TODAY 
JUST GIVE IT TO THEM JOHNNY 
YOU KNOW DO IT 
GET THE TEAM TOGETHER 
DON'T TALK SO MUCH LISTEN A LITTLE BIT AND WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
HE WILL CERTAINLY HAVE TO DO THAT 
A TRILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY TO SAVE WITHOUT CUTTING YOUR THROAT
