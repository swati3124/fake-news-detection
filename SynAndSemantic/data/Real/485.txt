BOTH AFRICAN AMERICAN AND WHITE RESIDENTS OF ARKANSAS PAID THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO SIX TERM GOVERNOR ORVILLE TODAY IN LITTLE ROCK 
HIS POLITICAL CAREER WAS DEFINED BY HIS REFUSAL TO ALLOW A LITTLE ROCK HIGH SCHOOL TO BE INTEGRATED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS WERE LATER BROUGHT IN TO PROTECT NINE BLACK STUDENTS 
WON FOUR MORE TERMS AFTER THE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CRISIS 
HE ALSO WAS KNOWN FOR BOOSTING INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND CREATING COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE 
ORVILLE A DEMOCRAT DIED YESTERDAY 
HE WAS EIGHTY FOUR YEARS OLD 
THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION MET TODAY TO DECIDE IF THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO CLINTON CAMPAIGN NEEDED TO REPAY THE GOVERNMENT FOR MATCHING FUNDS 
AN REPORT HAD RECOMMENDED THE CLINTON GORE CAMP GIVE BACK A WHOPPING FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PLUS 
BUT AFTER A PARTISAN VOTE OF THE COMMISSIONERS TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE THE CAMPAIGN WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO GIVE BACK MOST OF THAT MONEY 
OUR BROOKS JACKSON WAS AT THE MEETING 
HE'S HERE NOW TO TELL US ABOUT IT 
BROOKS 
JUDY IF THE AUDITORS HAD BEEN UPHELD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO REPAY IN THE TWENTY YEARS THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAD BEEN GETTING PUBLIC FINANCING TO ASSIST THEIR CAMPAIGNS 
BUT ON A KEY VOTE THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO LET THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN OFF FOR ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS 
AND WHEN THE VOTE CAME IT CAME ALONG PARTISAN LINES 
SAY I. THOSE OPPOSED TO THE MOTION 
MADAME SECRETARY THE MOTION FAILS BY A VOTE OF THREE TO THREE 
COMMISSIONERS ELLIOT 
REPUBLICANS WERE VOTING AGAINST BILL CLINTON AND DEMOCRATS VOTING FOR HIM 
THE ISSUE HERE WAS WHETHER BILL CLINTON'S PRIMARY CAMPAIGN HAD A DEBT AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER ABOUT THE TIME OF THE CONVENTION 
AND THE REASON THERE WAS A QUESTION WAS THAT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE POURING INTO THE CAMPAIGN EVEN AFTER THE PRIMARIES WERE OVER 
BUT THE CAMPAIGN TRANSFERRED THAT MONEY TO A LEGAL FUND FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION 
REPUBLICANS SAID OH NO THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MONEY THAT WENT TO THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN 
IF YOU PUT WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DOUBT 
THEREFORE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL MONEY 
DEMOCRATS TOOK THE OPPOSITE POSITION 
AND BECAUSE IT TAKES FOUR VOTES UNDER LAW TO DO ANYTHING THE STAFF WAS NOT UPHELD 
THE CAMPAIGN WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO REPAY THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS 
SO EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TECHNICAL IT WASN'T TECHNICAL 
THERE WAS POLITICS 
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT THE SOME INTRIGUE IN THE FINDINGS IN ALL THIS 
AMONG THE THINGS THE AUDITORS WERE QUESTIONING WAS A THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SETTLEMENT 
THAT'S ALL THAT IT SAID ON THE CHECK JUST SETTLEMENT 
WHEN THEY INQUIRED THEY SAID IT WAS SECRET THAT THE TERMS PRECLUDED SAYING WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT 
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE OF TAXPAYER MONEY 
ALL RIGHT 
BROOKS JACKSON THANKS 
BERNIE 
WELL THAT'S ALL FOR THIS EDITION OF INSIDE POLITICS 
I'M BERNARD SHAW
