ROSS PEROT CLAIMS THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IS SIMILAR TO SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT 
PEROT ARGUING HIS CASE AGAINST NAFTA BEFORE THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE TODAY 
HE SAYS IT WILL MEAN JOBS WILL MOVE TO MEXICO A CLAIM NAFTA SUPPORTERS DISPUTE 
PEROT ALSO CALLED IT ECONOMIC TREASON FOR AN AMERICAN TO LOBBY ON BEHALF OF THE INTERESTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES 
THE IOWA SUPREME COURT SAYS THERE'S A BALANCING OF RIGHTS AT A POLITICAL RALLY AND A TIPPED THE BALANCE WHEN HE DENIED FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH THE CHANCE TO SPEAK 
AT A NINETEEN NINETY FUNDRAISER CHARLES AND OTHERS VOICED THEIR OPPOSITION TO UNITED STATES INVOLVEMENT IN KUWAIT 
APPEALED HIS CONDUCT CONVICTION SAYING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH WAS VIOLATED 
THE IOWA STATE SUPREME COURT RULED PRESIDENT BUSH POSSESSED THE SAME RIGHT AND DENIED IT 
THE CONVICTION STANDS 
MANY AMERICANS CONSIDER IT THEIR RIGHT TO POKE FUN AT THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM 
WHAT WOULD EDITORIAL CARTOONISTS DRAW OR HUMORISTS TALK ABOUT IF NOT FOR POLITICS 
WELL IN RUSSIA POLITICS HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A LAUGHING MATTER BUT THAT'S CHANGING AS C. N. N.'S CLAIRE SHIPMAN REPORTS 
RUSSIANS HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED A GOOD CHUCKLE AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR LEADERS BORIS YELTSIN INCLUDED 
OF COURSE A FEW YEARS AGO MAKING FUN OF THE KREMLIN BOSS WOULDN'T HAVE HAD FUNNY RESULTS 
OH THERE WERE PLENTY OF JOKES ABOUT THE OLD GUYS ALL RIGHT BUT TOLD ON THE SLY 
THESE DAYS WITH POLITICAL THEATRICS IN HIGH GEAR IT'S OPEN SEASON ON ALL POLITICIANS 
IN MARCH THERE WAS A KREMLIN MEETING THIS YOUNG COMIC SANG NOT TO DECIDE WHICH BRANCH HAS POWER BUT FROM WHICH BRANCH THEY ALL SHOULD HANG 
FOR THE LAST HALF DECADE POLITICAL HUMOR HAS BEEN ON THE RISE BUT SOME THINK IT MAY BE LOSING IT'S APPEAL 
IT WAS INTERESTING THEN BECAUSE IT WAS FORBIDDEN FRUIT SAYS THE DIRECTOR OF THIS THEATER COMPANY NOW WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM IT TOWARD EVERYDAY HUMOR 
TAKE THIS LITTLE ABOUT HIGH PRICES AND THE SEARCH FOR AN AFFORDABLE PAY TOILET 
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO BUT LAUGH HE SAYS BUT POLITICS AREN'T WORTH LAUGHING AT 
OLGA FOR ONE THOUGH STILL ENJOYS A GOOD JOKE ABOUT ANTICS AT THE TOP 
IT SEEMS TO ME OUR CONGRESS IS A LOT LIKE A CIRCUS SHE SAYS BUT LESS TALENTED 
HMM 
MAYBE SO 
THE PEN OF COURSE CAN PROVE EQUALLY CUTTING 
MAGAZINE OPENLY ALL THE BIG SHOTS 
IN DECADES PAST IT TOWED A CAREFUL POLITICAL LINE DRAWING LAUGHS FROM SCENES OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
VLADIMIR SAYS PEOPLE MAY BE TIRED OF POLITICS BUT TRY AS THEY MIGHT THEY CAN'T ESCAPE FROM HIGH PRICES AND SPIRALING INFLATION THE SUBJECT OF THIS CARTOON 
IT'S ALL POLITICS AT ROOT 
AND OF COURSE THE MAN WHO MADE ALL THIS PUBLIC FUN POKING POSSIBLE HAD HIMSELF INCLUDED 
HE'S STILL GOOD FOR A LAUGH NOW AND THEN 
SO IF THE AILMENT IS RUSSIAN POLITICS LAUGHTER MAY NOT BE THE CURE BUT IT CERTAINLY HELPS TO EASE THE PAIN 
CLAIRE SHIPMAN C. N. N. MOSCOW 
THAT'S ALL FOR THIS EDITION OF INSIDE POLITICS 
I'M BERNARD SHAW
