COMMUNITY MEETINGS MAY BE ONE REASON WHY OAKLAND CALIFORNIA DID NOT ERUPT IN VIOLENT RAGE AFTER THE VERDICT IN THE LOS ANGELES POLICE TRIAL 
CRAIG HEAPS EXAMINES HOW OAKLAND PREVENTED THE WORST 
IN MANY WAYS PARTS OF OAKLAND RESEMBLE PARTS OF LOS ANGELES POOR FILLED WITH CRIME INFESTED WITH DRUGS 
AND YET WHEN THE VERDICT CAME DOWN IN THE RODNEY KING BEATING TRIAL OAKLAND REMAINED PEACEFUL 
COMMUNITY LEADERS SAY THE REASON IS THAT EVEN BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGAN THEY HAD BEGUN HOLDING MEETINGS IN RESPONSE TO THE CITY'S SOARING HOMICIDE RATE MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM 
WE HAD PUT A LOT OF ENERGY IN THE COMMUNITY BY HOLDING THESE TYPE OF MEETINGS AND TOWN MEETINGS AND RAP SESSIONS AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT CROPPED UP 
PEOPLE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF VIOLENCE 
DON SUTTON LEADS MEETINGS ANYWHERE HE CAN IN BLACK COMMUNITY ORGANIZING PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS TO DRUGS POVERTY CRIME AND 
IF WE DON'T TAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BACK WE'VE GOT TO 
SUTTON IS NOT ALONE 
THE OAKLAND MEN'S PROJECT HELPS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ROOTS OF VIOLENCE ROOTS THAT ARE OFTEN PLANTED IN THE HOME 
IN THEIR WORKSHOP THEY ACT OUT THE SCENE OF A FATHER WHOSE NINE YEAR OLD SON BRINGS HOME A BAD REPORT CARD 
YOU KNOW WHAT D. STANDS FOR 
DUMMY 
THAT'S NOT FAIR I 
DON'T YOU RAISE UP ON ME MAN 
I'LL KNOCK YOUR BLOCK OFF 
YOU'RE A DUMMY 
WHAT ARE YOU SOME KIND OF MAMA'S BOY 
THE LITTLE BABY'S GOING TO CRY 
WHY DON'T YOU LEARN TO GROW UP AND ACT LIKE A MAN 
AND THEN THEY TRY TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT IS THIS NINE YEAR OLD BOY LEARNING FROM HIS DAD ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO BE MAN 
JUST THROW OUT SOME WORDS SOME QUALITIES WHAT'S HE LEARNING 
DON'T CRY 
VIOLENCE 
OKAY DON'T CRY AND VIOLENCE 
WHAT ELSE 
AGGRESSION 
AGGRESSION 
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO ACT ONE WAY IN SOCIETY BUT IF THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'VE BEEN INGRAINED TO THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY MAY LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACT AND BEHAVE 
COMMUNITY LEADERS SAY PEACE IN THE PAST IS NO GUARANTEE OF PEACE IN THE FUTURE 
WELL NOW I'M AFRAID THAT IF WE DIDN'T EXPLODE THEN THAT AT SOME POINT SOON IF WE DON'T BEGIN TO CORRECT SOME OF THESE SITUATIONS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PROBLEM WE DID IN L. A. 
AND THEY SAY MANY OF THOSE SOLUTIONS WILL HAVE TO COME FROM WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY BECAUSE WITHOUT EACH OTHER THEY DON'T HAVE A PRAYER
