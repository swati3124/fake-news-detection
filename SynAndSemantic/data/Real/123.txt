NOW HERE'S THE LATEST WAY TO PLAY THE MARKET 
A NEW INVESTMENT TRADING ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE FOR LESS THAN A WEEK IT HAS SOME TRADERS FLOCKING TO IT SOME RUNNING THE OTHER WAY 
BEVERLY SCHUCH EXPLAINS THAT ONE 
FIRST IT WAS SPIDER MAN AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE NOW SPIDERS ARE CRAWLING ALL OVER THE AMERICAN EXCHANGE 
BUT STIFLE THAT SCREAM 
THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE SPIDERS TRY HARD TO BE FRIENDLY 
SPIDER IS A ACRONYM FOR A STANDARD AND POOR'S DEPOSITORY RECEIPT 
SO WHAT'S THAT 
IT'S A NEW TECHNICALLY ENGINEERED EQUITY THAT MIRRORS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STANDARD AND POOR'S FIVE HUNDRED INDEX 
IT'S A SECURITY THAT LOOKS TASTES SMELLS AND FEELS JUST LIKE A SHARE OF STOCK ON THE MARKET 
BUYING ONE SPIDER AT ABOUT FORTY FOUR DOLLARS ALLOWS INVESTORS TO RIDE THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED'S MOVES AT ONE TENTH THE PRICE 
THE SPIDER ALSO PAYS A DIVIDEND BASED ON ITS FRACTION OF THE S. AND P'S DIVIDENDS 
RIGHT NOW THAT'S ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE PER QUARTER 
SPIDERS MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLE STOCK INDEX MUTUAL FUNDS VERY POPULAR WITH SMALL INVESTORS LATELY 
THE AMEX HOPES TO SHARE THAT BOOM 
ADVANTAGE IS THEY CAN BE TRADED MOMENT BY MOMENT 
MUTUAL FUNDS ONLY ALLOW YOU TO GET IN OR OUT AT DAY'S END 
THE ONLY REAL QUESTION INVESTORS SHOULD ASK BEFORE TAKING THESE SPIDERS HOME IS WHETHER A LARGE STOCK BROAD MARKET INDEX IS THE PLACE TO BE 
THAT'S YOUR MONEY BEVERLY SCHUCH C. N. N. BUSINESS NEWS NEW YORK 
UP NEXT A SUCCESSFUL MUTUAL FUND MANAGER 
HE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT KINDER INVESTMENTS
