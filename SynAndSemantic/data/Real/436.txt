FROM A VIEW FROM THE HEAVENS WE'RE GOING TO BE CHECKING THE WEATHER HERE ON EARTH NOW WITH THE SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS AND ALSO WITH JOHN HOLLIMAN 
IT MUST LOOK WET IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY ANYWAY 
WELL IT DOES AND THEY CAN'T REALLY SEE WHAT'S ON THE GROUND HERE BUT THEY CAN SEE WHAT'S CAUSING ALL THE RAIN WE'RE HAVING 
THE ENDEAVOUR CREW HARD AT WORK TODAY ON THE FLIGHT DECK SENDING RADAR PICTURES OF THE EARTH TO GROUND BASED SCIENTISTS DOWN HERE 
IT'S RAINING HARD IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW 
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM OVERHEAD 
THIS IS THE SHUTTLE'S PAYLOAD BAY CAMERA 
WE'VE SEEN THINGS TODAY AS YOU CAN SEE THIS HEAVY CLOUD COVER OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES CAUSING ALL THE RAIN WE'VE SEEN 
THERE'S ALSO A VOLCANO ON RUSSIA'S PENINSULA 
IT'S THE HEADLINE FROM THE MISSION SO FAR 
THE SPACE RADAR LAB IS ALSO WORKING WELL 
THE PICTURES THAT COME DOWN LIVE FROM THE SHUTTLE ARE BLACK AND WHITE AND THEY'RE NOT AS CLEAR OR AS GOOD AS THE FINAL PICTURES THAT'LL BE COMPUTER ENHANCED BACK ON EARTH LATER 
ASTRONAUT TOM JONES SAYS HE'S LOOKING FOR CHANGES SINCE HIS LAST MISSION IN THE SPRING 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR CHANGES SINCE LAST APRIL'S S. T. S. FIFTY NINE MISSION SPACE RADAR LAB I. WE'RE LOOKING FOR CHANGES IN THE PREVIOUS MASS DATA OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
AND THESE TWO FLIGHTS AND OTHER FLIGHTS IN NASA'S MISSION TO PLANET EARTH WILL SHOW THE ABILITY TO MONITOR THE EARTH BY THE GLOBAL SYSTEM ON A PERMANENT BASIS 
COMING UP A LITTLE LATER TODAY SOME OF ENDEAVOUR'S CREW MEMBERS WILL TALK WITH C. N. N. ABOUT THE MISSION AND HOW IT'S GOING SO FAR 
PICTURES SO FAR HAVE JUST BEEN INCREDIBLE AND I WAS ASKING YOU YESTERDAY ABOUT THAT VOLCANO 
THEY JUST HAPPENED UPON THAT 
YEAH WELL IT WAS IN THE FLIGHT PATH ANYWAY BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BLOW UP 
THE LAST TIME IT ERUPTED WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND THE TIME BEFORE THAT WAS LIKE IN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED'S I BELIEVE SO IT WAS JUST A HAPPENSTANCE OCCURRENCE AND THE SHUTTLE IS FLYING SO LOW TO THE GROUND THAT THE PICTURES ARE MUCH MORE CLEAR THAN THEY NORMALLY ARE 
IT USUALLY FLIES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY OR ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILES UP AND IT'S ABOUT FORTY MILES CLOSER TO US WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE SO CLEAR 
ALL RIGHT
