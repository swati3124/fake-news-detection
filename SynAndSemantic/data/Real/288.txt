IN UPSTATE NEW YORK TODAY TWO MEN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH CARRYING OUT A BOMBING CAMPAIGN AGAINST MEMBERS OF ONE FAMILY 
FIVE PEOPLE DIED WHEN SOMEONE WITH A GRUDGE SENT SIX PACKAGE BOMBS TO VARIOUS FAMILY MEMBERS ALL TO BE DELIVERED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME ALL DESIGNED TO KILL WHEN THEY WERE OPENED 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S KAREN 
IT WAS A CUNNING ACT TO COMMIT ESPECIALLY CHILLING DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON 
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SEVERAL PACKAGES CONTAINING TOOL KITS WERE DELIVERED ACROSS ROCHESTER BUFFALO AND NORTHERN NEW YORK STATE TO MEMBERS OF THE FOWLER FAMILY 
THEY WERE LETHAL GIFTS CAREFULLY DESIGNED SO THAT LIFTING A LATCH WOULD SET OFF A BOMB 
IT WAS THE WORST EXPLOSION I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE 
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY CAME THROUGH THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR IN A CAR 
IT WAS SO LOUD 
BY EIGHT O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT FOUR BOMBS HAD EXPLODED WITHIN NINETY MINUTES AT ELEANOR HOME HER HUSBAND'S OFFICE HER DAUGHTER'S TOWNHOUSE 
IN THE END FIVE MEMBERS OR FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY WERE DEAD TWO WERE WOUNDED 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND BASICALLY HOW THEY WERE DESIGNING AND MAKING THESE DEVICES 
AFTER SEARCHING THE AREA THIS MORNING POLICE TOOK THREE PEOPLE INTO CUSTODY FOR QUESTIONING BRENDA THE DAUGHTER OF THE MICHAEL T. STEVENS HER BOYFRIEND WHO FIT THE COMPOSITE SKETCH POLICE ISSUED AND EARL FIGLEY A TRANSIENT WHOSE LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE WAS THIS MOTEL 
THIS EVENING LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE ARREST OF MICHAEL STEVENS AND EARL FIGLEY ON CHARGES OF INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF EXPLOSIVES USED TO KILL 
ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS EARL FIGLEY PURCHASED FIFTY FIVE POUNDS WORTH OF EXPLOSIVES IN KENTUCKY TRANSPORTED THEM TO THE ROCHESTER AREA 
THEY WERE THEN MADE INTO BOMBS 
AND THERE IS A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'LL SEE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPLAINT 
AND THOSE EXPLOSIVES WERE USED TO KILL AND THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT NEW YORK STATE 
NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE FOWLER DAUGHTER 
BUT ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS THIS CASE COULD GO BEFORE A GRAND JURY WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS 
AND IF CONVICTED THE TWO MEN COULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY 
AS TO THE MOTIVE NEITHER POLICE NOR PROSECUTORS WILL COMMENT 
KAREN A. B. C. NEWS ROCHESTER 
STILL ON THE SUBJECT OF VIOLENCE A NEW ELECTRONIC BILLBOARD HAS GONE UP IN NEW YORK'S TIMES SQUARE 
THE DEATH CLOCK IS THE IDEA OF A GUN CONTROL GROUP 
IT WILL TICK OFF THE NUMBER OF GUNS MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOT TO DEATH 
ALONG THE COAST OF NEW JERSEY THIS WEEK'S BLAST OF COLD WEATHER MAY BE TOO MUCH FOR SOME DOLPHINS TRAPPED BY ICE IN AN INLAND WATERWAY 
POLICE AND COAST GUARD BOATS TRIED TO CLEAR A PATHWAY FOR THEM TODAY BUT THE ICE REFORMED AND THE BOATS SCARED THE DOLPHINS AWAY
