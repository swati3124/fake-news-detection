THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES WHO ARE MAKING THE PRESIDENT AN ISSUE IN THEIR CAMPAIGN ADS 
C. N. N.'S BRUCE MORTON EXPLAINS IN TODAY'S ADS IN THE SPOTLIGHT SEGMENT 
JOE VOTES TO INCREASE TAXES AND FEES OVER FORTY TIMES 
THIS IS NINETEEN NINETY FOUR'S HOTTEST AD THE MORPH SHORT FOR METAMORPHOSIS IN WHICH YOUR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT TURNS INTO BILL CLINTON 
THE POLITICALLY CORRECT SAY IT'S NOT RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT MORALS AND FAMILY VALUES 
PRESIDENT CLINTON BECOMES CONGRESSMAN MIKE SYNAR WHO LOST HIS PRIMARY 
SENATE CANDIDATE DAVE MCCURDY AND THE PRESIDENT MORPH 
REPUBLICANS FIGURE TO ASSOCIATE SOMEONE WITH CLINTON AND YOU'VE GOT HIM BEAT 
I MEAN WHEN YOU WOULD RATHER SORT OF BE SEEN LIKE WITH A TOPLESS DANCER THAN WITH YOUR PRESIDENT THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED SORT OF A VERY GOOD SIGN OF WHICH WAY THE TIDE IS FLOWING HERE 
JIM SASSER HAS SPENT THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS IN WASHINGTON 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE TRY MOUNTAIN 
RUSHMORE AND THE GALAXY OF DEMOCRATIC VILLAINS 
IF YOU LIE LOUD ENOUGH AND LONG ENOUGH 
IN PENNSYLVANIA THE REPUBLICAN ATTACKED BY CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT JAMES CARVILLE WHO WORKED FOR CLINTON 
WHAT'S AN INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT TO DO 
THEY'VE GOT TO STRESS THEIR OWN RECORDS AND THEIR OWN ACHIEVEMENTS 
THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED 
INDEPENDENCE IS THE WORD 
MY CAMPAIGN IS DEDICATED TO OKLAHOMA VALUES AND FAITH IN THE AMERICAN DREAM 
I ASK OKLAHOMANS TO VOTE FOR ME BECAUSE OF MY INDEPENDENCE AND EXPERIENCE IN FIGHTING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT 
IF THERE'S ONE UNIFYING THEME THAT'S OUT THERE IT IS CRIME 
I WOKE UP TO THE DOORKNOB TURNING AND A GUY HAD BROKEN INTO OUR HOUSE 
SHE WAS AWAKENED BY A MAN STANDING OVER HER BED WITH A KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND SKI MASK OVER HIS FACE 
KEEPING VIOLENT CRIMINALS IN JAIL HASN'T BEEN A PRIORITY IN GEORGIA 
IF GUY WERE GOVERNOR IT WOULD BE 
BOTH PARTIES CAMPAIGN AS TOUGH ON CRIME 
IT'S EASIER FOR DEMOCRATS NOW BECAUSE THE CRIME BILL PASSED 
THE DEATH PENALTY PLAYS IN SOME STATES 
JIM EDGAR SUPPORTS THE DEATH PENALTY 
DAWN CLARK OPPOSES IT 
IN FACT LAST WEEK SAID THAT IF ELECTED GOVERNOR SHE WOULD SIGN LEGISLATION TO ABOLISH THE DEATH PENALTY 
THERE'S A MORE NEGATIVE TONE TO THE ADS 
I THINK IN PART THAT'S DUE TO THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY 
THERE'S A LOT OF CYNICISM IN THE NATION RIGHT NOW 
SOMETIMES CANDIDATES IN TROUBLE GO NEGATIVE 
EDWARD KENNEDY IN A CLOSE RACE WITH MITT ROMNEY IS USING NEGATIVE ADS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
I DON'T LIKE CREATING JOBS 'CAUSE HE TOOK EVERYONE OF THEM AWAY 
ONE MORE THEME FAMILY VALUES 
THIS IS BIPARTISAN 
REPUBLICAN OLIVER NORTH PUT HIS WIFE ON CAMERA 
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A SPECIAL MAN 
HE'S A FATHER WHO LOVES HIS CHILDREN AND A PATRIOT WHO FOUGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY 
DEMOCRAT JIM COOPER WENT TO CHURCH 
THE VALUES I LEARNED HERE AS IMPORTANT TODAY AS WHEN THIS CHURCH WAS BUILT 
EVERYONE AGREES POLITICAL ADS HAVE GONE HIGH TECH 
CONSULTANT SAYS JUST LIKE ADS FOR NIKE 
BUT YOU STILL NEED A MESSAGE AND IT WILL BE NOVEMBER BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT WORKED 
BRUCE MORTON C. N. N. WASHINGTON
