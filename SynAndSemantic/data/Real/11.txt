THE PRESIDENT FACES A CONFRONTATION WITH CONGRESS WHEN HE RETURNS TO WASHINGTON 
THE HOUSE TODAY VOTED TO CUT FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE DEFENSE BUDGET 
THAT SETS UP A POSSIBLE FIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT 
NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH TO CUT BUT ABOUT WHAT TO CUT 
THE HIGH TECH SEA WOLF SUBMARINE IS AT THE CENTER OF THE DISPUTE AS IRV CHAPMAN REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON 
THE SEA WOLF A TWO BILLION DOLLAR NUCLEAR SUBMARINE DESIGNED TO STALK THE SOVIET WAR FLEET 
THE SUB NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT ELECTRIC BOAT IN CONNECTICUT WOULD BE THE LAST ONE IF PRESIDENT BUSH HAD HIS WAY 
BUT THE HOUSE VOTED TO KEEP THESE WORKERS EMPLOYED BUILDING ONE MORE SEA WOLF A DAY AFTER THE SENATE VOTED FOR TWO MORE 
CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAINTAIN A DEFENSE STRUCTURE THAT CAN PROTECT OUR INTERESTS AND ALMOST EVERYONE I TALKED TO BELIEVE THAT SUBMARINES OUGHT TO BE PART OF THAT MIX 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS ALREADY TOLD CONGRESS HE'LL VETO ADDITIONAL SPENDING ON THE SEA WOLF BUT THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP PLUNGED AHEAD ANYWAY CASTING REPUBLICAN OBJECTIONS ASIDE 
IF THE PEOPLE OUT IN THAT LISTENING LAND IN AMERICA THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS ANY OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO WIN THEY'RE MISTAKEN THE DICE ARE LOADED 
THERE'S NO CHANCE 
THE DEMOCRATS OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED THEIR BILLS IN BOTH HOUSES 
THE SENATE PAYS FOR TWO EXTRA SEA WOLVES BY TAKING MONEY FROM THE B. TWO STEALTH BOMBER AND FROM STRATEGIC DEFENSE AGAINST INCOMING MISSILES STAR WARS 
THEY OUGHT TO CUT S. D. I. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T PUT THE MONEY INTO THE SEA WOLF THEY SHOULD PUT IT INTO DOMESTIC PROGRAMS OR DEFICIT REDUCTION 
SUPPORTERS OF THE SEA WOLF SAID IT WOULD COST AS MUCH TO PAY FOR SHUTTING DOWN CONSTRUCTION AS TO BUILD ANOTHER SUB 
THE SEA WOLF IS THE LATEST CASE OF CONGRESS IGNORING IT'S OWN PROMISE TO INCREASE THE PEACE DIVIDEND BECAUSE BENEFITS TAKE TIME TO PRODUCE WHILE JOB LOSSES FROM DEFENSE CUTS ARE IMMEDIATE
