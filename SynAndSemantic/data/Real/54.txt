THE GLOW HAS RETURNED TO THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY'S AWARDS SHOW 
LAST YEAR THE CEREMONY DEGENERATED INTO A GRAB FEST BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY TUESDAY NIGHT 
HERE'S C. N. N.'S SHERRIE DEAN 
HOW IS THIS NIGHT DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER NIGHTS 
THERE'S AN ANSWER IN ONE WORD 
WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR ACTOR TONY RANDALL SERVED AS HOST TO HELP LAUNCH THE NEW AWARDS TUESDAY NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY 
THE AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE IN THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY ENDED IN DISGRACE LAST YEAR WHEN ORGANIZER BILL EVANS FAILED TO SHOW UP AND AD EXECUTIVES FROM PRINT AND RADIO STORMED THE STAGE AND JUST TOOK AWARDS 
A SECOND CEREMONY FOR TELEVISION COMMERCIALS WAS SIMPLY CANCELED AND BILL EVANS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY 
BUT THE TRADEMARK FOR THE WAS BOUGHT BY RUTH AN ADVERTISING TRADE PUBLISHER 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO RESTORE THE INTEGRITY OF THE AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR 
WELL WE'RE HERE TONIGHT AND THAT'S A REALLY BIG STEP I THINK THE FACT THAT THE ARE ONGOING AND ENDURING 
BUT WE DID A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO 
WE GAVE ALL OF LAST YEAR'S WINNERS THEIR STATUETTE 
UNTIL LAST YEAR'S THE AWARDS WERE CONSIDERED THE OSCARS OF THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY 
THIS YEAR HOWEVER MANY AD AGENCIES DECLINED TO SUBMIT ENTRIES 
BUT WE ARE TOLD BY THE ORGANIZERS OF THE NEW AWARDS THAT THEY STILL RECEIVE MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF ENTRIES FROM SOME FORTY FOUR COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD 
ADVERTISING VERONICA CAME ALL THE WAY FROM MALAYSIA TO SEE IF SHE'D WIN 
AND WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO WIN A AWARD 
ACHIEVEMENT OF A LIFETIME I TELL YOU 
THAT'S TO ME THE THE ULTIMATE 
AND THE SCANDAL FROM LAST YEAR DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU 
NOT NOW 
IT'S A NEW TO ME 
JACK PRODUCTION COMPANY CHOSE NOT TO ENTER THE COMPETITION THIS YEAR 
WE WERE CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THE AWARDS WOULD BE ABLE TO SPRING BACK TO THEIR FORMER IN ONE SHORT YEAR 
THE EVENING CEREMONY WENT OFF WITHOUT TOO MANY 
MORE THAN EIGHTY WINNERS WERE CALLED TO THE STAGE BUT NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO MAKE AN ACCEPTANCE SPEECH 
THE COMMERCIALS THEMSELVES WERE THE STARS OF THE EVENT 
THE WINNERS WERE CHOSEN BY A PANEL OF THIRTY FIVE HIGH RANKING ADVERTISING EXECUTIVES 
THEY DID A SUPERB JOB ON THE JUDGING PROCESS 
THEY MANAGED IT AS PROFESSIONALLY AS I'VE EVER SEEN AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AND WHAT OF BILL EVANS THE MAN WHO RAN THE OLD 
WELL HE WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
