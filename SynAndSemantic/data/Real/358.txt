THAT STORY IN THIS PART OF ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS GO INTO EFFECT AGAINST HAITI TOMORROW NIGHT 
HAITIANS EXPECT HARDSHIP 
REFUGEES FROM RWANDA ARE STILL COMING OVER THE BORDERS IN TANZANIA 
HUGE NUMBERS ARE GATHERED IN AN ISOLATED AREA 
GETTING FOOD TO THEM WILL BE DIFFICULT 
AMERICAN MOVIES ARE MAKING NEWS IN CANNES 
AND A NEW BOOK THE TOBACCO LOBBY NOT EASY TO DO 
I HANDED THIS BOOK IN IN AUGUST 
A MONTH AGO OR SO I WATCHED THE NOW FAMOUS WAXMAN HEARINGS AT WHICH THE SEVEN HEADS OF THE TOBACCO COMPANIES SWORE THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK NICOTINE WAS ADDICTIVE 
AS YOGI BERRA WOULD SAY I WAS HAVING DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN 
FIRST NEWS 
THIS IS ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
I'M LINDA WERTHEIMER 
AND I'M NOAH ADAMS 
THE UNITED STATES IS ATTEMPTING TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON HAITI'S MILITARY LEADERS 
YESTERDAY PRESIDENT CLINTON LISTED DRUG TRAFFICKING AS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE U. S. MIGHT USE FORCE AGAINST HAITI 
TODAY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTS THAT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS EVIDENCE WHICH TOP HAITIAN MILITARY OFFICERS IN DRUG SMUGGLING 
AND TOMORROW AT MIDNIGHT THE UNITED NATIONS PLANS TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST HAITI 
THERE HAS BEEN A BAN ON SENDING OIL AND WEAPONS TO HAITI SINCE LAST OCTOBER 
NPR'S DAVID WELNA REPORTS FROM THE HAITIAN CAPITAL PORT AU PRINCE THAT THE FIRST ONES TO FEEL THE BRUNT OF THE NEW EMBARGO WILL BE HAITI'S POOR 
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CAPITAL NEAR THE AIRPORT DOZENS OF BIG WAREHOUSE LIKE STRUCTURES ARE NEARLY ALL THAT REMAINS OF WHAT USED TO BE A THRIVING INDUSTRY HERE THE ASSEMBLY OF CLOTHING FOR EXPORT 
WHEN PRESIDENT ARISTIDE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE HAITI AT GUNPOINT IN SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THESE ASSEMBLY PLANTS OPERATING 
ONE BY ONE THEY'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN THOUGH CRIPPLED BY VARIOUS ECONOMIC EMBARGOES 
FOR THE SEVERAL DOZEN PLANTS THAT DID MANAGE TO SURVIVE IT'S GOING TO BE ALL OVER THIS WEEKEND WHEN THE FULL EMBARGO TAKES EFFECT 
TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE DOWN THE PLACE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL THEM TO LEAVE AND THAT'S IT AND WE'LL PAY THEM WHATEVER WE OWE THEM AND WE TELL THEM TO LEAVE 
THAT'S IT 
THIS FRENCHMAN NAMED JEAN OWNS HAITI'S BIGGEST CLOTHING ASSEMBLY PLANT A COMPANY CALLED WORLD TEXAS 
TODAY IS THE LAST FULL DAY OF WORK FOR HIS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES 
HE'S BEEN PAYING THEM ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR TO STITCH TOGETHER SWEAT SHIRTS AND BLUE JEANS FOR AMERICAN STORES LIKE WAL MART AND K. MART 
CLAIMS THAT MEAGER INCOME HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR THOSE WORKERS TO FEED THEMSELVES AND AS MANY AS NINE OTHERS IN THEIR HOMES 
BUT WITH THE FULL EMBARGO ESTIMATES THAT MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED JUST BY THE CLOSING OF HIS FACTORY 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY FOOD TO EAT 
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE NOTHING TO EAT 
I MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO STARVE 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY 
I MEAN THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AFTER THEIR JOBS 
LIKE MANY OTHERS HERE IS CONVINCED A FULL EMBARGO WILL NOT FORCE THE MILITARY TO LEAVE THE POLITICAL ARENA 
HE POINTS TO HOW THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALREADY MADE A WINDFALL CONTROLLING CONTRABAND OIL 
WITH A TOTAL TRADE EMBARGO THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE MUCH MORE CONTRABAND FOR THE MILITARY TO EXPLOIT 
IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT THE MILITARY FOR SURE 
I MEAN THEY'RE MILITARY 
THEY HAVE PLENTY MONEY 
THEY DON'T THE MORE YOU HAVE THE EMBARGO THE MORE MONEY THEY HAVE 
I MEAN IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GETTING RICHER AND RICHER EVERY DAY NOW 
THIS SEWING MACHINE IS STITCHING TOGETHER ONE OF THE LAST ITEMS OF CLOTHING WORLD TEX WILL BE ABLE TO EXPORT 
A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS WORTH OF A PRE CUT FABRIC REMAINS TO BE BUT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SHIP IT OUT AFTER THE WEEKEND 
IN ALL ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND HAITIANS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS IN FACTORIES LIKE THIS ONE BECAUSE OF THE NEW EMBARGO 
PIERRE FRANCOIS IS THE HEAD MECHANIC AT WORLD TEXAS 
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO FEED HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AFTER THE WEEKEND 
IF I DON'T WORK IT HIM CAN'T GET CAN'T DO NOTHING 
ARE YOU AFRAID 
YES I'M AFRAID BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS VERY VERY BAD 
THE FACTORY'S MANAGER ESTIMATES THAT NINETY PERCENT OF THE ABOUT TO BE UNEMPLOYED WORKERS ARE GOING TO DO WHAT MANY OTHER HAITIANS ARE PLANNING TO DO GET ON A BOAT AND TRY TO MAKE IT TO FLORIDA 
EARLIER TODAY I ASKED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO HAITI WILLIAM SWING ABOUT THOSE WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOBS AND WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF THEM 
WELL IT'S FRANKLY IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE QUESTION OF THE REFUGEES AND THE AWFUL PROBLEM WITH HUMAN RIGHTS NOW AND THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OF THE ECONOMY THAT UNFORTUNATELY ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO A MACRO POLITICAL SOLUTION 
AMBASSADOR SWING SAYS THE U. S. PLANS TO DOUBLE THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEALS IT SERVES HAITIANS EACH DAY TO RELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF A FULL EMBARGO 
SWING HIMSELF SEEMS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE EMBARGO FORCING OUT ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL RAOUL CEDRAS AND HE'S UNWILLING TO GUESS HOW LONG THE NEW SANCTIONS WILL BE IMPOSED ON HAITI
