FEW OF THE PICTURES THAT EMERGED FROM THE RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES WERE AS DISTURBING AS THE ONES THAT SHOWED A MAN BEING PULLED FROM A TRUCK BEATEN AND NEARLY KILLED 
TODAY L. A. POLICE ARRESTED THREE SUSPECTS IN THAT BEATING 
C. N. N.'S ANNE MCDERMOTT REPORTS 
THE BEATING OF REGINALD DENNY PROVIDED ONE OF THE MORE SEARING IMAGES OF THE VIOLENCE IN L. A. A BEATING CARRIED ON WITH NO POLICE IN SIGHT 
THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT IS VERY VERY CONCERNED AT OUR INABILITY TO REACH MR. DENNY AT THAT TIME HE WAS BEING ASSAULTED AND AFTER AND TO ASSIST HIM AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT AT LEAST THIS WILL ATONE FOR SOME OF THAT IN BRINGING THESE VERY VERY VICIOUS CRIMINALS TO BE PROSECUTED 
THE ARRESTS OF THE THREE MEN SUSPECTED OF BEATING DENNY TWO GANG MEMBERS AND ONE KNOWN TO ASSOCIATE WITH GANG MEMBERS WERE MADE POSSIBLE POLICE SAY BECAUSE DENNY'S BEATING WAS VIDEOTAPED JUST AS RODNEY KING'S BEATING BY POLICE OFFICERS WAS VIDEOTAPED 
IT WAS THE ACQUITTAL OF THOSE OFFICERS THAT SPARKED THE VIOLENCE THAT CLAIMED SO MANY LIVES AND INJURED SO MANY OTHERS LIKE DENNY 
CHIEF OF POLICE DARYL GATES WHO HAS SEEN HIS REPUTATION SOUR IN THE WAKE OF THE VIOLENCE IN THE WAKE OF THE KING BEATING TOOK THE UNUSUAL STEP OF ARRESTING ONE OF THE DENNY SUSPECTS HIMSELF DAMIAN WILLIAMS ALSO KNOWN AS FOOTBALL 
HE IS THE ONE THAT TOOK THE BRICK WHEN MR. DENNY WAS ON THE GROUND ON HIS KNEES AND RAISING HIS HAND FOR HELP THE ONE THAT CAME OVER AND HIT HIM SIDE OF THE FACE WITH A BRICK 
I WANTED VERY MUCH TO PERSONALLY ARREST HIM 
ONE SUSPECT REMAINS AT LARGE AND THE INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING 
AS FOR DENNY SEEN HERE IN BETTER DAYS WITH HIS DAUGHTER HE REMAINS HOSPITALIZED IN GOOD CONDITION 
HE ISSUED A STATEMENT MONDAY CALLING WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM DURING THE VIOLENCE AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION 
HE ADDED HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ANY SLUR AGAINST ANY PEOPLE AN ECHO OF RODNEY KING'S PLEA DURING THE VIOLENCE THAT PEOPLE MUST LEARN TO GET ALONG
