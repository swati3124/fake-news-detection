FOR MIKHAIL GORBACHEV HISTORY CAME FULL CIRCLE TODAY AT A TINY MISSOURI COLLEGE KNOWN AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE IRON CURTAIN 
C. N. N.'S JEFF FLOCK REPORTS THE FORMER SOVIET LEADERS GOAL WAS TO SHED THE REMNANTS OF THE COLD WAR AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE 
IT WAS HISTORICAL MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WITH A POST MORTEM ON THE COLD WAR DELIVERED FROM THE SAME PODIUM WINSTON CHURCHILL FORECAST IT FROM FORTY SIX YEARS EARLIER 
HE CAME TO THE SAME TOWN TOURED THE SAME CAMPUS ATE THE SAME LUNCH AS CHURCHILL 
BUT WHILE CHURCHILL WARNED OF MILITARY AGGRESSION 
FROM IN THE BALTIC TO IN THE ADRIATIC AN IRON CURTAIN HAS DESCENDED ACROSS THE CONTINENT 
GORBACHEV WARNED AGAINST MORE BASIC PROBLEMS 
BUT TODAY GLOBAL CLIMATIC SHIFTS THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT THE OZONE HOLE ALL THREATEN THE STABILITY FOR THE PLANET 
LIKE CHURCHILL GORBACHEV'S ADDRESS FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE 
IF SPEECH WAS THE IRON CURTAIN SPEECH THEN PERHAPS GORBACHEV'S COULD BE CALLED THE 
NEW CIVILIZATION SPEECH 
BUT WHILE CHURCHILL HOPED HIS VIEW HIS FORECAST OF A COMING COLD WAR WAS WRONG GORBACHEV CLEARLY HOPES THAT HIS VIEW OF A NEW COOPERATIVE WORLD ORDER DELIVERED HERE COMES TRUE 
HE CALLED FOR WORLD CONTROLS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS REGULATION OF NUCLEAR POWER AN END TO ALL WEAPONS EXPORTS AND A FOCUS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL AS A DRAMATIC REORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO ADMINISTER IT ALL 
BOB GUTHRIE WAS THERE TO HEAR BOTH CHURCHILL AND GORBACHEV AND IS SKEPTICAL 
THE WORLD GOVERNMENT IDEA A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T READY FOR IT 
I'M NOT 
BUT I'M READY FOR COOPERATION AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO BRING ALONG SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN BROUGHT ALONG SO FAR 
OTHERS MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO DIGEST IT ALL 
IT WAS IMPRESSING 
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO BE HERE AND PART FOR THIS HISTORICAL EVENT 
IT WAS WONDERFUL 
GORBACHEV HIMSELF SUMMED UP THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN POST WORLD WAR TWO NINETEEN FORTY SIX AND THE POST COLD WAR ERA FORTY SIX YEARS LATER 
THE GOAL TODAY HAS NOT CHANGED PEACE AND PROGRESS FOR ALL 
BUT NOW WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO APPROACH IT WITHOUT PAYING THE HEAVY PRICE WE'VE BEEN PAYING THESE PAST FIFTY YEARS OR SO 
GORBACHEV SAYS CHURCHILL AND THE WEST MISJUDGED THE THREAT OF SOVIET AGGRESSION IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX 
STALIN HE SAYS WAS AFRAID OF WAR WITH THE WEST A LESSON SAYS GORBACHEV THAT THE FUTURE MUST BE BUILT ON COOPERATION NOT CONFLICT
