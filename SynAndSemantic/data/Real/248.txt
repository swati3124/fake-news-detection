PRESIDENT CLINTON AIDES SAY HE IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ENFORCING THE COMING SANCTIONS 
MORE ON THAT FROM C. N. N.'S JILL DOUGHERTY 
THE WHITE HOUSE WELCOMED THE UNITED NATIONS VOTE APPROVING MILITARY ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS ON HAITI BUT U. S. WARSHIPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT TO HAITIAN WATERS READY TO INTERCEPT AND SEARCH VESSELS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OIL OR GUNS FOR HAITI 
HAITIAN PRESIDENT JEAN BERTRAND ARISTIDE PRAISED THE MOVE AND SAID IT WOULD SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO HAITI'S MILITARY 
I AM QUITE SURE THE WAY WE ARE MOVING IS THE RIGHT WAY 
BEFORE THOSE FOLKS THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE 
NOW THEY ARE REALIZING IT'S SERIOUS 
THAT WILL WORK 
SATURDAY THE PRESIDENT TOOK TWO FURTHER STEPS SENDING IN THIRTY ADDITIONAL MILITARY PERSONNEL TO BEEF UP THE U. S. EMBASSY SECURITY DETACHMENT IN HAITI'S CAPITAL 
AND REMOVING THE ADVANCE TEAM FOR CONSTRUCTION AND TRAINING THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY COULD NOT FUNCTION UNTIL CONDITIONS IMPROVED 
MR. CLINTON IN HIS WEEKLY RADIO ADDRESS MADE NO MENTION OF HAITI CONCENTRATING INSTEAD ON THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
BUT REPUBLICANS JUMPED ON THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF HAITI AND OTHER CRISES CHARGING HE HAD NOT LEARNED THE LESSONS OF VIETNAM AND LEBANON 
IN SOME CASES SUCH AS RUSSIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT REASONED AND CONSTRUCTIVE 
YET IN OTHER KEY AREAS NAMELY DEFENSE POLICY SOMALIA HAITI AND BOSNIA THE ADMINISTRATION HAS STUMBLED AND THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS 
BUT ONE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ARGUED PRESIDENT CLINTON IS BEING JUDGED MORE HARSHLY THAN PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS 
THESE EVENTS IN RECENT DAYS ARE THE FIRST REAL UNFOLDING OF THE POST COLD WAR DYNAMIC AND IT IS INEVITABLE IF IT WERE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO WAS THERE OR ANY OTHER PRESIDENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE VERY TENSIONS SURFACE THAT ARE NOW SURFACING 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF EMBROILED IN THE TENSIONS OF HAITI THIS WEEK LOOKED TOWARD ANOTHER HOT SPOT SOMALIA FOR WHAT HE CALLED A VALUABLE LESSON 
THE U. S. HE SAID SHOULD AVOID BECOMING A POLICE OFFICER 
WE CAN'T GO INTO ANY SORT OF SITUATION LIKE THIS EVER AND ALLOW THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE IN THE END ALL THESE FOLKS NOT JUST IN SOMALIA BUT EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD ULTIMATELY HAVE TO RESOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN DESTINY 
BUT WITH THE HAITIANS AT THIS JUNCTURE APPARENTLY UNABLE TO RESOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS THE U. S. SEEMS READY ONCE AGAIN TO PUT ON ITS POLICE BADGE AND AT LEAST THREATEN TO USE FORCE
