THE LATEST A SURVEY SHOWS CONSUMERS ARE MORE CONFIDENT AND ECONOMISTS EXPECT NEW SIGNS TODAY OF GREATER ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER 
JOINING US THIS MORNING IS DAVID JONES CHIEF ECONOMIST OF AUBREY G. LANSTON 
HE'S GOING TO TELL US WHAT IT ALL MEANS 
FIRST OF ALL DAVID DO YOU BELIEVE THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FIGURES 
THEY'RE RISING BUT MOST OF THE SURVEYS PRECEDE THE LOS ANGELES RIOTS AND THE RISE IN OIL PRICES 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS IMPROVING DEBORAH 
AND I THINKS IT'S TRUE IN ALL SURVEYS UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE CONFERENCE BOARD ALL THE KEY CONSUMER SURVEYS PEOPLE FEEL BETTER 
GRADUALLY 
THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT A BOOM 
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING SPEND WITHOUT CHECKING PRICES CAREFULLY 
SOME PEOPLE STILL HAVE TROUBLE GETTING CREDIT 
BUT ON BALANCE THIS ECONOMY'S GOING TO DO WELL 
THE GOVERNMENT TODAY IS SUPPOSED TO RELEASE ITS FINAL ESTIMATE OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO REVISE IT UP AGAIN 
WOULD YOU SEE THAT AS SIGN OF REALLY MORE ROBUST RECOVERY OR DO YOU THINK THE EXTRA PRODUCTION JUST ENDED UP IN INVENTORIES 
I THINK THAT'S THE LATTER CASE 
I WOULDN'T PUT MUCH WEIGHT ON THE FIRST QUARTER 
I THINK WE MAY BE UP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND ONE HALF AND THREE PERCENT COMPARED WITH THE FIRST ESTIMATE OF TWO PERCENT 
BUT NOBODY BOUGHT WHAT WAS PRODUCED 
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE KEY 
THE KEY IS GOING TO BE THE SECOND QUARTER 
AND WE STUART AND I HAVE DEBATED THAT FOR SOME TIME 
AND STUART'S RIGHT 
I DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT ON THE SHOW BUT THE SECOND QUARTER'S GOING TO BE GOOD THREE PERCENT AND MAYBE EVEN A GOOD THIRD QUARTER 
SO I'M CONCEDING GROUND TO STUART ON THIS ECONOMY 
YEAH I WAS ABOUT TO SAY EXACTLY THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE VERY PESSIMISTIC EARLIER IN THE YEAR 
YOU DID TALK ABOUT A WEAK ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MORE ROBUST ECONOMY 
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR FORECAST HAVEN'T YOU 
YOU HAVE NOT LET ME FORGET THAT 
DON'T NEED TO SHOW YOUR SHOES 
WELL YOU'RE ON VIDEOTAPE SAYING AND THAT'S ALWAYS A MISTAKE YOU KNOW 
IT'S DANGEROUS STUART 
GO ON 
BUT THE ANSWER IS THINGS ARE BETTER 
CONSUMERS ARE BETTER 
LOOK AT AUTO SALES IN THE DOMESTIC AUTO SALES IN THE MIDDLE TEN DAYS OF MAY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION UNITS UP FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN IN THE PREVIOUS TEN DAY PERIOD 
IF THAT KIND OF SELLING RATE KEEPS UP WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AUTO PRODUCTION MORE JOBS 
GENERALLY WHAT WE'VE GOT IS THE SEEDS OF RECOVERY ARE HERE 
IT'S STILL NOT GOING TO BE A BOOM AND I'LL STICK WITH THAT VIEW 
THREE PERCENT IS STILL HALF OF WHAT NORMAL RECOVERIES ARE 
BUT 
BUT IT'S THEIR AND IT'S HERE TO STAY 
BUT THREE PERCENT THREE THREE AND ONE HALF PERCENT GROWTH WITHOUT INFLATION WITH INTEREST RATES STAYING FAIRLY LOW IS EXACTLY WHAT EVERY ECONOMIST REALLY WANTS FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS IT NOT 
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN BETTING ON STUART 
THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HOLDING THE STOCK MARKET QUITE HIGH 
BUT WHERE DO GET THIS FROM THREE PERCENT REAL GROWTH WITH NO INFLATION 
WE'VE JUST SEEN OIL PRICES GO UP RATHER SIGNIFICANTLY 
I'VE HEARD SOME ESTIMATES THAT INDICATE THAT COULD ADD A POINT TO THE INFLATION RATE 
IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE STRONGER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A RISING INFLATION RATE WHY IS THE BOND MARKET RALLYING 
WHY ARE YIELDS COMING DOWN 
THEY KEY DEBORAH IS THE BOND MARKET HAS NOT BEEN DOING THAT WELL 
IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SORT OF IN A TRADING RANGE 
WE RALLY DOWN TO SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN AND SEVEN EIGHTHS OR SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS ON THE THIRTY YEAR TREASURY AND THEN SLIP BACK UP ABOVE EIGHT PERCENT AS SOON AS WE SEE RECOVERY 
AND THAT'S THE RUB 
IF WE HAVE RECOVERY WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH HIGHER INFLATION 
OIL PRICES ALREADY UP AND OTHER PRICES OF INDUSTRIAL COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN MOVING HIGHER 
SO THEY WON'T GO UP AS FAST AS NORMAL SINCE THE ECONOMY IS RECOVERING SLOWLY BUT THE ANSWER IS THIS WE'VE SEEN THE BEST INFLATION NEWS 
SO WHAT GOES ON IS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS INFLATION BEGINS TO CREEP HIGHER AND LONG TERM INTEREST RATES DRIFT HIGHER 
SO IT'S NOT ALL GOOD NEWS THROUGH 
BUT THE HIGH YIELDS FELL YESTERDAY IN SPITE OF ALL THIS 
WHY 
WELL GENERALLY THAT WAS JUST A QUICK RALLY 
REMEMBER WE HAD A WE THE BOND MARKET WAS GIVEN ALL FINANCIAL MARKETS WERE GIVEN A SHOCK WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON MAY NINETEENTH HAD DECIDED NOT TO EASE POLICY IN CONTRAST WITH THE MARKET EXPECTED 
THE BOND MARKET IS REALLY JUST BASICALLY IN A TRADING RANGE 
DAVID THEY ARE ABOUT TO PLAY OUR SONG WHICH MEANS WE'RE OUT OF TIME 
SO WE'VE GOT TO GO TO COMMERCIAL BREAK 
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT FRIDAY 
MANY THANKS
