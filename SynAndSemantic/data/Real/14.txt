ALMOST TWO OUT OF THREE HOMICIDES IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVE GUNS 
NO INVESTIGATION OF VIOLENCE WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHETHER RESTRICTING GUNS MIGHT SAVE LIVES 
BUT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT PRODUCES MORE ARGUMENTS THAN CONCLUSIONS 
THE RHYTHMS OF LIVESTOCK AND CROPS SET THE PACE OF MARVIN WORLD 
ALL SPRING AND SUMMER LONG WE SEE THE NEW HATCH WE SEE COME AROUND RABBITS THINGS LIKE THAT 
HIS FARM IN LONE TREE IOWA IS A LONG WAY FROM THE BIG CITY AND A LONG WAY FROM BIG CITY FEARS OF GUNS AND VIOLENCE 
TO MARVIN HIS GUNS ARE A SOURCE OF PRIDE 
HE TEACHES GUN SAFETY CLASSES AND HE MAKES HIS OWN AMMUNITION 
HE USES HIS GUNS FOR SPORT AND AS TOOLS FARM IMPLEMENTS TO PROTECT HIS CROPS AND ANIMALS LEGITIMATE NEEDS IN HIS VIEW THAT MAY BE THREATENED BY PROPOSALS TO RESTRICT GUNS 
OKAY MIGHT AS WELL LOAD UP 
FOR HIM ALL GUNS AT A GUN CLUB FOR INSTANCE JUST WOULDN'T WORK 
I MEAN I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO ME RUN CLEAR TO A GUN CLUB JUST TO GET A FIREARM BECAUSE MAYBE I HAVE TROUBLE WITH A FOX OR A COYOTE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE GETTING INTO LIVESTOCK AND I WANT A GUN RIGHT AWAY 
ON FARMS FIREARMS ARE USED FOR PEST CONTROL IN DEALING WITH ANIMALS PREDATORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THEY HAVE MORE OF A BUSINESS FUNCTION THAN THEY OFTEN DO IN CITIES 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GUNS AND VIOLENCE IS FAR FROM SIMPLE YET STUDIES INDICATE THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES GUN LAWS HAVE SAVED LIVES 
FOR INSTANCE WASHINGTON D. C.'S BAN ON HAND GUN SALES 
AFTER THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT IN LATE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HOMICIDES AND GUN SUICIDES WENT DOWN 
AND OVERALL THE RATES OF HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE COMMITTED BY MEANS OTHER THAN GUNS DID NOT CHANGE 
THE RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE FORTY SEVEN LIVES WERE SAVED EACH YEAR 
UNFORTUNATELY AFTER CRACK HIT THE STREETS VIOLENT DEATH RATES SHOT UP 
BACK ON THE FARM GUN RELATED DEATHS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SUICIDE THAN MURDER 
THAT CONTROLLING HAND GUNS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS WE CAN DETECT OR VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF FARMERS SUICIDES SELF INFLICTED DEATH BECAUSE THEY TEND NOT TO USE THEM 
THE GUN DEBATE IS NOT JUST URBAN VERSUS RURAL 
JUST A COUPLE OF TOWNS OVER FROM MARVIN FARM LIVES BETSY ROSS 
TO HER GUNS ARE A REMINDER OF THE PAIN SHE FELT AFTER HER HUSBAND KILLED HIMSELF 
HE JUST PICKED IT UP PROPPED IT AGAINST THE IN THE TRUNK LEANED AGAINST IT REACHED DOWN AND PULLED THE TRIGGER 
NOW HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT IF THAT GUN HADN'T BEEN RIGHT THERE FOR HIM TO JUST REACH OUT AND PICK UP 
SHE WROTE A BOOK AS A WAY TO SUPPORT OTHER SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE MOST COMMITTED WITH GUNS 
IS THE PROBLEM GUNS OR PEOPLE 
GUNS KILL PEOPLE 
GUN AVAILABILITY AND GUN LAWS ARE BASICALLY IRRELEVANT 
REALLY WHAT WOULD I SAY 
BULL 
IT'S NOT CLEAR CUT SAY RESEARCHERS WHO FIND GUNS AND PEOPLE HAVE A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP OF COMPETING RISKS AND BENEFITS 
FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THIS DATA IT COULD BE QUITE CONFUSING 
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT CONFUSION SERVES A POLITICAL AGENDA 
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION CHARGES THE LEADING PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS ARE INCOMPETENT AND SHOULD LOOSE FEDERAL FUNDING 
NO ONE CHALLENGES WORK THAT IS ANTI GUN THE MEDIA LOVE IT BUREAUCRATS LOVE IT THEY SIMPLY DON'T APPLY THE SAME STANDARDS TO RESEARCHERS IN THOSE AREAS 
I'M NOT ANTI GUN I'M ANTI HOMICIDE I'M ANTI GUNSHOT INJURY I'M ANTI PEOPLE BEING CRIPPLED FOR LIFE WHEN THEIR SPINE IS SEVERED BY A BULLET 
ART IS NO MORE HONEST PERSONALLY THAN HE IS IN HIS RESEARCH 
OPPOSING THE N. R. A. ARE GUN CONTROL LOBBYISTS 
ON BOTH SIDES LOBBYISTS ARGUE POSITIONS THAT OFTEN GO BEYOND WHAT RESEARCH DATA CAN SUPPORT 
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE THE PROBLEM OF GUNS IS JUST GETTING OVERWHELMING 
AT TIMES THE POLITICS ALSO SEEM OVERWHELMING 
YET RESEARCHERS HAVE FAITH THAT BY SORTING THROUGH THE FACTS UNDERSTANDING EVENTUALLY WILL EMERGE INSIGHT ON HOW TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PEOPLE WHO USE GUNS FOR DEFENSE OR FOR BUSINESS 
RESEARCHERS RECOGNIZE GUNS UNLIKE SOME VIRUS DO NOT BY THEMSELVES CAUSE THE DISEASE OF VIOLENCE 
GUNS ARE ONLY ONE PIECE OF THE VIOLENCE PICTURE 
IF YOU DID AWAY WITH ALL GUNS TOMORROW YOU'D STILL HAVE A VIOLENT SOCIETY 
SINGING HIS TRUTH IS MARCHING ON 
THESE ARE THE VOICES THAT VIOLENCE IN AMERICA THREATENS TO SILENCE 
EVERY SINGLE DAY I GO TO THE MORGUE AND I SEE CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE LOTS OF BULLET HOLES IN THEIR BODIES OR THEY HAVE LOTS OF STAB WOUNDS 
IF THESE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BOYS DIE BEFORE THEY BECOME ADULTS THE MOST LIKELY REASONS WILL BE MURDER OR SUICIDE 
ALL THESE INTELLECTUAL FOLKS WITH ALL THESE BRAINS AND ALL THESE DEGREES DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE DEAL IS 
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO SAVE YOUR LIFE BUT YOU DO 
RESEARCHERS SEEK ANSWERS TO VIOLENCE BY SEEKING TO KNOW THE PEOPLE VIOLENCE CONSUMES 
THAT JOURNEY TOWARD KNOWLEDGE HAS JUST BEGUN WITH THE CONSENSUS THAT VIOLENCE IS MORE THAN A MATTER FOR POLICE AND PRISONS 
IT'S A THREAT TO LIFE AND HEALTH THAT CAN BE STUDIED LIKE CANCER OR HEART DISEASE 
AND WHEN WE STARTED DOING THIS STUFF WE WOULD PUBLISH SOMETHING AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY HO HUM WE'D NEVER HEAR IT WAS LIKE DROPPING A ROCK INTO A WELL AND NOT HEARING ANYTHING 
SO IT'S GOOD THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IT 
RESEARCHERS DRAW A PARALLEL TO TOBACCO SMOKING A DEADLY BEHAVIOR THAT WAS ONCE ACCEPTED IS NOW SHUNNED 
THAT SAME THING IS TRUE ABOUT VIOLENCE THAT IT'S A LEARNED BEHAVIOR AND THAT IT CAN BE 
IN IOWA LEGISLATORS RECENTLY MET WITH RESEARCHERS SEEKING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO ABOUT VIOLENCE 
WE DON'T HAVE A SOUND BASIS FOR INFORMATION THAT HAVING A GUN IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN NOT HAVING A GUN 
I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT'S SO BUT MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE NOT 
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS MUST HAVE CLEAR VISION CLEAR INFORMATION ON VIOLENT ACTS 
AND RIGHT HERE IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN ANOTHER SHOOTING ANOTHER STATISTIC 
AS SOON AS POLICE ARRIVED AT THE SCENE THEY STARTED GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRIVE BY SHOOTING OF A YOUNG MAN 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE YOU UP FOR AN OPERATION YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT 
AT THE HOSPITAL DOCTORS GATHERED EVEN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT AND HIS WOUNDS 
BUT MOST OR ALL OF THAT INFORMATION REMAINS LOCKED IN INDIVIDUAL FILES OUT OF THE REACH OF RESEARCHERS WHO NEED BETTER DATA IN ORDER TO DRAW A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE DAMAGE VIOLENCE 
GOVERNMENT FILES DO SHOW MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND LIVES LOST EACH YEAR TO HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE IN THE UNITED STATES 
RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THERE MAY BE A HUNDRED TIMES THAT MANY INJURED SURVIVORS FIVE MILLION EACH YEAR BUT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS FOR SURE 
HE'S GONNA FIND ONE OF HIS LITTLE BUDDIES AND HE'S GONNA GET SOMETHIN' TO HURT DAD OR DAD GONNA HURT HIM 
EFFORTS TO TREAT VIOLENCE ARE IN THEIR INFANCY 
I THINK THAT ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON FIREARM VIOLENCE IN LESS THAN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS IS KIDDING THEMSELVES 
BUT I WANT MY CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO HAVE A SAFER COUNTRY TO LIVE IN 
ON WILKINS FIRST BIRTHDAY HER GUARDIANS HAVE THAT SAME WISH 
SOME DAY HER UNCLE MAY HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HER A WORLD IN WHICH MOTHER WAS SHOT DOWN JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS STANDING ON THE WRONG STREET CORNER 
I THINK A LOT OF TIMES ABOUT THE OTHER FAMILIES WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING I'VE GONE THROUGH OR WHO WILL GO THROUGH THE SAME THINGS IN THE FUTURE 
AND THE CHILDREN GROWING AWARE OF THE VIOLENCE SWIRLING AROUND THEM ERODING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR LIVES 
THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE TREATED THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE HANDLED THEY MUST BE REDIRECTED 
THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE HELPED 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
