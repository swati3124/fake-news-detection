PALESTINIANS EAGER FOR AUTONOMY CHEERED THE ARRIVAL OF A FORCE OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS TODAY IN THE WEST BANK CITY OF HEBRON 
BUT THAT WARM WELCOME ENDED QUICKLY AS NEW VIOLENCE ERUPTED BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS 
A. B. C.'S DEAN REYNOLDS REPORTS 
THEY ARE CALLED A TEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN THE CITY OF HEBRON 
A HUNDRED OR SO NORWEGIANS DANES AND ITALIANS SHOWED UP TODAY WITH THE BLESSING OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 
THOSE FOREIGNERS WITH WHITE UNIFORMS WILL GIVE A FEELING OF SECURITY A FEELING OF SOME CHANGE 
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GIVE THAT FEELING TO THE PALESTINIANS OF HEBRON THIRTY OF WHOM WERE KILLED TEN WEEKS AGO BY A JEWISH SETTLER 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME ISRAEL HAS EVER PERMITTED A FOREIGN FORCE ONTO LAND IT OCCUPIES 
THE MEN IN WHITE SAY THEY WILL BE NEUTRAL GO BETWEENS 
WE ARE OBSERVERS 
THAT'S OUR JOB 
WE OBSERVE 
AND TODAY THEY GOT AN 
WITHIN MINUTES OF THEIR ARRIVAL A FAMILIAR CLASH WAS UNDERWAY WITH THE COMBATANTS OBLIVIOUS TO THE OBSERVERS HAVING A PRETTY HARD TIME OBSERVING ANYTHING THROUGH THE TEAR GAS 
IN GAZA TODAY A BIG CROWD WAITED FOR THE PALESTINIAN POLICE FORCE TO COME MARCHING IN FROM EGYPT 
BUT IT NEVER DID 
THE ISRAELI ARMY SPENT ALL DAY PROCESSING THE PALESTINIANS' NEW WEAPONS WHILE THE POLICE COOLED THEIR HEELS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER 
TO MANY PALESTINIANS THAT WAS FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT ISRAEL IS BARELY ITS GRIP 
THEY WILL KEEP CONTROLLING EVERYTHING 
SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
IT WAS THE SAME STORY IN JERICHO 
THEY HAD A PARADE BUT THE POLICE FORCE NEVER MADE IT IN FROM JORDAN 
JUST AS IN GAZA THERE WAS NO SIGN AT ALL OF THE SELF RULE PROMISED IN THE AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST WEEK 
APPARENTLY NEITHER THAT NOR MUCH OF ANYTHING ELSE WILL HAPPEN UNTIL P. L. O. CHAIRMAN YASIR ARAFAT NAMES A NEW PALESTINIAN COUNCIL TO ASSUME CONTROL FROM ISRAEL 
AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS WHEN ARAFAT WILL GET AROUND TO DOING THAT IS ARAFAT
