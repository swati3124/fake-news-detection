HELLO 
HI BRIAN 
TO THAT WOMAN THERE IS SOMEBODY TO VOTE FOR 
I'M VOTING FOR ROSS PEROT 
OKAY WHY 
THE MAN IF YOU HAVEN'T READ HIS BOOK YOU SHOULD THE MAN HAS HIS BOOK IN WHICH HE DETAILS A COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM 
THAT BOOK CAN EASILY FIX THE ECONOMY IN THIS COUNTRY IT DETAILS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION 
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IF YOU VOTE FOR PEROT YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BALLOT BECAUSE HE CAN'T WIN 
NO THAT'S NOT TRUE HE'S NOT A SPOILER EITHER 
WHEN GEORGE BUSH OR BILL CLINTON WERE BEHIND ROSS IN THE POLLS NO ONE CALLED THEM 
JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT A MEMBER OF THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM WHICH OUR CONSTITUTION DOESN'T DICTATE THERE SHOULD BE THEY'VE SET THE SYSTEM UP SO THERE ARE RULES THAT PROHIBIT THIRD PARTIES 
JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT LEADING IN THE POLLS NOW DOES NOT MEAN HE'S A SPOILER 
HE CAN WIN 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE POLLS IN JUST A SECOND 
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE LATEST POLL WE'LL TAKE A FEW MORE PHONE CALLS FIRST 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN CALIFORNIA 
HELLO 
GLENDALE CALIFORNIA 
FIRST OF ALL I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR BUSH BECAUSE HE'S A HYPOCRITE AND A LIAR 
I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR PEROT BECAUSE HE IS AN AND HE'S TRYING TO BUY THE WHITE HOUSE 
I WILL VOTE FOR CLINTON BECAUSE HE SEEMS THE MOST HONEST OF THE THREE EVEN WITH HIS PROBLEMS WITH THE DRAFT 
DO YOU SEE HIM AS A OF THREE EVILS 
NO NOT REALLY 
I THINK HE'S GOT A NEW MESSAGE BUT HE'S BEEN DOGGED BY THIS THING ABOUT THE DRAFT 
OKAY WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL PLEASE 
WHERE ARE YOU CALLING FROM 
CHEYENNE WYOMING 
OKAY WYOMING 
GO AHEAD 
HI THIS IS JOHN STARK FROM WYOMING 
I THINK THAT I WILL BE VOTING FOR BILL CLINTON THIS YEAR 
WHY 
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S THE TYPE THAT HAS STRUGGLED ALL OF HIS LIFE TO GET WHERE HE IS TODAY AND HE'S MORE DOWN TO EARTH 
HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY REALLY IS WHEREAS THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES SEEM TO HAVE EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED IN LIFE 
OKAY WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
BILL CLINTON AND GEORGE BUSH BOTH HAVE DISTINCT PLANS TO JUMP START THE ECONOMY 
PEROT HAS YET TO OFFER SPECIFICS BUT WE'RE WAITING 
OF COURSE THE DEBATES ARE NOT FAR AWAY 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN ILLINOIS 
HELLO 
HI I'VE GOT TO SUPPORT GEORGE BUSH 
I JUST THINK HIS FOREIGN TRADE POLICY IS MUCH BETTER THAN CLINTON COULD EVER COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW CLINTON COULD COME UP WITH AS GOOD A FOREIGN TRADE POLICY AS BUSH IS 
OKAY 
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK IN ILLINOIS AND THAT'S AFFECTING A LOT OF FOLKS THERE 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR CALL 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL 
HELLO WHERE ARE YOU CALLING FROM 
I'M CALLING FROM VERO BEACH FLORIDA 
OKAY GO AHEAD 
ROSS PEROT NEVER SAID HE WAS GOING TO RUN BACK IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER BUT WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD RUN I'LL TELL YOU I CRIED 
HE DID SAY IF YOU PUT HIM ON THE BALLOT IN FIFTY STATES HE'D RUN 
HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD 
HE'S GOING TO RUN I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM AND BRIAN IT'S NOT FAIR 
IT'S NOT JUST A TWO PARTY RACE IT'S NOT A THREE PARTY RACE WE HAVE THE LIBERTARIANS WE CAN'T FORGET THOSE PEOPLE 
AND TO THE LADY FROM CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON D. C. IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR 
ROSS PEROT IS THE ONLY MAN THAT'S NOT BOUGHT AND PAID FOR SO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM 
IT SEEMS LIKE THE ISSUES ARE VERY CLOUDED 
EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION AND THEIR OPINIONS ARE JUST TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT 
I DO AND I THINK THAT WHEN CAMPAIGN GETS ROLLING I THINK MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO HIM 
I THINK HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO'S REALLY CLEAR ON THE ISSUES 
DID IT REALLY UPSET YOU WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE RACE 
WELL YOU KNOW IT DID 
THAT EVENING THOUGH WHEN I HEARD HIM SAY WHY HE DID IT I ACCEPTED IT 
I BELIEVE HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD 
BUT DID YOU THINK HE HAD SOMETHING COOKING IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND 
DID YOU THINK WELL YEAH I THINK HE'S GOING TO GET BACK IN LATER ON 
I ALWAYS BELIEVED HE WOULD AND I'M THE KIND OF PERSON THAT DIGS DEEP INTO THINGS LIKE THAT AND I'M A SKEPTICAL PERSON 
BUT I REALLY THINK HE COULDN'T STAND THE WAY GEORGE BUSH ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLICANS WERE PUTTING HIM DOWN 
LIKE THE WAY HE WROTE BUSH A MEMO SAYING THAT HE FOUND SOMEONE WAS INVESTIGATING ONE OF HIS BOYS 
THEN GEORGE BUSH IS TALKING TO BARBARA WALTERS ON T. V. SAYING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ROSS PEROT 
IT'S STUFF LIKE THAT 
I DON'T THINK ROSS PEROT HAS TO TAKE THAT KIND OF THING 
OKAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR CALL 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN CALIFORNIA 
HELLO 
HELLO 
YES GO AHEAD 
YES I'M FOR GEORGE BUSH I'M SORRY FOR BILL CLINTON BILL CLINTON 
I'M NOT FOR PEROT I DON'T TRUST HIM AND BUSH I HAVE TWO JOBS NOW AND I STILL CANNOT MAKE ENDS MEET 
WHAT PART OF CALIFORNIA ARE YOU FROM 
LOS ANGELES 
YES AND YOU MUST SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK THERE A LOT OF FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE ECONOMY 
A LOT OF THEM 
A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE A LOT OF FRUSTRATED PEOPLE AND I'M ONE OF THEM 
OKAY WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL 
YOU KNOW SOME RECENT POLLS HAVE SHOWN PRESIDENT BUSH BEHIND BILL CLINTON BUT CANDIDATE BUSH WILL LIKE THIS PARTICULAR POLL 
IT'S THE PRESIDENTIAL BEAN POLE AT THE INN HOTEL IN BRUNSWICK GEORGIA 
A JAR FOR EACH OF THE THREE CANDIDATES SITS IN THE LOBBY 
GUESTS ARE CASTING THEIR VOTES BY DROPPING A PINTO BEAN INTO THE BOTTLE DESIGNATED FOR THE MAN OF THEIR CHOICE AND SO FAR BUSH IS IN THE LEAD CLINTON IS A CLOSE SECOND ROSS PEROT IS THIRD 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK
