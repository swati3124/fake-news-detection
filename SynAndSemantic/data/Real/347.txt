WE WENT TO BALTIMORE THIS WEEK TO SEE A MOVIE STAR 
O. K. YOU YOUNG FOLKS RIGHT IN HERE 
WHERE YOU WANT TO GO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ARE YOU HERE TO SEE MARGUERITE 
THE WOMAN WE WENT TO MEET DOESN'T DO MOVIES FULL TIME 
IN FACT IT TOOK HER NINETY ONE YEARS TO GET HER FIRST ROLE 
MARGUERITE HAS SPENT MORE THAN HALF HER LIFE WAITING TABLES IN AN OLD FASHIONED RESTAURANT ON THE CORNER OF CHARLES AND PLEASANT STREETS IN BALTIMORE 
THE WOMAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXCHANGE IS A KIND OF A PLACE WITH ITS DOORMAN AND AND SCRATCH BAKED ORANGE 
IT SHOWED UP BRIEFLY IN NORA FILM SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE SO MISS MARGUERITE GOT UP ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
SHE WILL MAKE HER ENTRANCE HERE SOON 
FIRST SOME HISTORY 
THE WOMAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXCHANGE HAS BEEN LOCATED IN THIS FOUR STORY RED BRICK BUILDING SINCE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN 
IT'S A COMBINATION RESTAURANT BAKERY AND GIFT SHOP 
LIKE A PERMANENT CHURCH WAS ONE REPORTER'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SALES ROOM 
MANAGER RITA KNOX SAYS THE EXCHANGE WAS LAUNCHED AS A SALES ROOM AFTER THE CIVIL WAR 
WHEN THE MEN WENT OFF TO THE WAR THE WOMEN WERE LEFT AT HOME AND THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW THAT THEY NEEDED MONEY AND THEY WERE REALLY HURTING A LOT OF THEM 
AND SO THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD TRY TO SELL THE THINGS THAT THEY MADE BY HAND SO THE ONE WOMAN SAID THAT SHE WOULD TAKE EVERYTHING IN HER HOME AND SHE WOULD SELL THEM AND SHE WOULD KEEP TEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR 
AND SO IT'S BEEN GOING ON EVER SINCE 
ON THIS DAY IT'S A RED SWEATER WHICH WILL JOIN THE OTHER TOKENS APPROPRIATELY AND EMBROIDERED THE ANN DOLLS AND THE IN THE BIG WOMAN'S EXCHANGE SALES ROOM 
WE ADMIRE THE HANDIWORK AND THE BAKED GOODS BUT WE HAVE COME FOR ANOTHER REASON 
OH YES 
OUR STAR 
YOUR CLUB WILL BE RIGHT UP 
O. K. 
JUST A MINUTE 
AT NINETY THREE MARGUERITE IS CRISP AND AS A 
PALE RED HAIR CLEAR EYES BEHIND NOT TOO THICK GLASSES A MICRO STRIPED BLUE AND WHITE UNIFORM WITH NO ACTUAL BUT A BIG WHITE TIED INTO A HUGE BOW IN THE BACK MISS MARGUERITE HAS WORKED AT THE WOMAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXCHANGE SINCE NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
BEFORE THEN SHE WAITED TABLES AT OTHER BALTIMORE GENTILE PLACES LIKE THIS ONE FILLED WITH SOFT LAUGHTER AND THE OF WOMEN'S VOICES PLACES WITH GOOD NAMES THE DUTCH AND THE LOVELY LANE 
MOST OF THE WOMAN'S EXCHANGE WAITRESSES HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS 
THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY 
IN FACT MISS IDENTICAL TWIN SISTER WORKED HERE 
SHE DIED TWO YEARS AGO 
HAVING AN IDENTICAL TWIN ON THE PREMISES POSED SOME PROBLEMS 
AND WHEN ONE WENT IN ONE DOOR ONE CAME OUT THE OTHER MY SISTER DID 
AND ONE MAN SAID HE SAID AM I SEEING THINGS HE SAID HOW COULD ANYBODY WORK THAT FAST HE SAID YOU JUST WENT IN THE DOOR AND YOU CAME OUT. I SAID I HAVE A TWIN SISTER 
HE SAID WOULD YOU MIND GETTING HER SO WHEN I GET HOME I CAN TELL MY WIFE THAT I DIDN'T DRINK ANYTHING 
IN THE ALMOST HALF CENTURY MARGUERITE HAS BEEN AT THE WOMAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXCHANGE SHE HAS SERVED SOME OF OLD BALTIMORE'S ELITE 
I WAITED ON MRS. DECKER YOU KNOW BLACK AND DECKER AND HER SISTER FANNY FOX 
AND I WAITED ON I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK MRS. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER HER OR NOT 
WAITED ON THE LYONS THAT LIVED UP AT PARK 
SHE AND HER SISTER THEY WORE HATS AND GLOVES YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING JUST SO ON THEM 
NOW IT'S FOLKS LIKE US GLOVE LESS 
WE SIT ON WHAT MAY BE A LEATHER IN PLACES WITH TAPE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER RESTING OUR ON A PLAIN TABLE 
THE SMALL BLUE MENU LISTS FAIRLY PRICED FOODS FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE BOOK TOMATO CHARLOTTE RUSE TART 
ALL THE BAKING AND COOKING IS DONE BY DAY WILSON 
AT AGE FORTY THREE MISS REPRESENTS THE YOUTH ELEMENT AT THE WOMAN'S EXCHANGE 
SHE WAS FIFTEEN WHEN SHE STARTED HERE SETTING TABLES 
NOW SHE PRESIDES OVER THE OVENS AND BURNERS 
I LEARNED BY WATCHING 
I PICK UP THINGS BY WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE 
BUT AREN'T THERE THINGS ON THIS MENU THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOREVER 
YES MENU DO NOT COME HERE 
BASICALLY LIKE LAST WEDNESDAY WE HAD THE FRIED TOMATOES AND BACON WITH THE TOMATO SAUCE WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT SELLER 
AND WE HAVE FRESH SALMON FISH THAT WE SERVE AS A SPECIAL 
WHAT'S ONE TODAY 
WE HAVE CHIPPED BEEF ON TOAST WITH 
I KNEW THERE'D BE CHIPPED BEEF HERE 
THAT'S AN OLD TRADITION VERY OLD 
IT'S WELL BEFORE LUNCH TIME AND WE DIDN'T START OUT VERY HUNGRY BUT IT ALL SOUNDS SO GOOD AND WE'VE COME ALL THIS WAY 
SO WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND MISS MARGUERITE 
HONEY EVERYTHING IS GOOD 
CHICKEN SALAD IS GOOD CHIPPED BEEF ON TOAST CRAB SALAD CRAB CAKES 
WE ORDER AND MISS MARGUERITE OFF ON LEGS 
AT NINETY THREE HER STEPS ARE SMALL BUT SWIFT 
THERE'S A GOOD FORTY FEET OF BLACK AND WHITE CHECKED LINOLEUM BETWEEN OUR TABLE AND THE KITCHEN 
MISS MARGUERITE CROSSES IT IN ELEVEN SECONDS 
WE TIMED HER AND THEN WE WAIT FOR OUR FOOD JUST THE WAY MEG RYAN AND ROSIE O'DONNELL DO IN SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE 
THEY COME INTO THE EXCHANGE FOR LUNCH 
A WAITRESS ENTERS SCREEN RIGHT CARRYING TRAYS 
SHE MOVES BEHIND THE ACTRESSES AND PUTS THE TRAY DOWN 
NOW YOU SEE HER NOSE AND GLASSES IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER 
SHE SERVES CHICKEN 
BRINGING IN THE CHICKEN SALAD IN THAT SCENE SILENT BUT ALERT BALTIMORE'S OWN MARGUERITE HER ON SCREEN TIME A FULL TWO SECONDS SHORTER THAN HER REAL LIFE MARCH FROM TABLE TO KITCHEN 
WE ARE LUCKIER THAN MEG RYAN AND ROSIE O'DONNELL 
WITH US MISS MARGUERITE HAS A SPEAKING PART 
WELL THIS IS WHAT I SERVED THE STARS 
IS THAT WHY YOU GOT IT SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE 
MISS MARGUERITE FOUND MAKING MOVIES A BIT REPETITIVE 
SHE WAS FINE BUT SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS WOULD MESS UP 
SHE WOULD BEND DOWN TO GET HER HANDKERCHIEF OR KLEENEX AND THEY WOULD SAY CUT RIGHT 
THEN ALL THE FOOD CAME OFF THE TABLE HAD TO GO BACK TO BE MADE OVER AGAIN AND BROUGHT BACK 
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I SERVED THAT CHICKEN SALAD SPECIAL 
NOW TO US IT SEEMS A BIG DEAL THAT MISS MARGUERITE WAS IN A MOVIE BUT TO HER IT WAS JUST A DAY'S EVENT 
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO MISS MARGUERITE IS THE FACT THAT SHE HAS COME TO WORK AT THE WOMAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXCHANGE FOR ALL THESE YEARS 
CAN YOU IMAGINE NOT WORKING 
NO MY SON ALWAYS SAYS WELL YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR RETIREMENT NOW MOTHER 
BUT I'M NOT READY TO RETIRE RIGHT 
HOW OLD IS HE YOUR BOY 
SIXTY 
SO BUT YOU FEEL YOU'LL JUST WORK TILL YOU DROP 
IS THAT YOUR VIEW 
NOT IF I LISTEN TO HIM I WON'T 
ONLY THING HE SAID MOTHER WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS IF I RETIRE AND YOU'RE STILL WORKING EVERYONE SAYS AND YOUR MOTHER'S STILL WORKING I SAID I'LL PROMISE YOU SIX MONTHS BEFORE YOUR RETIREMENT I'LL RETIRE 
IT'S HARD TO SIT IN A ONE HUNDRED SEVEN YEAR OLD RESTAURANT TALKING WITH A NINETY THREE YEAR OLD WOMAN AND NOT ASK FOR SOME ADVICE ON LIVING 
WELL YOU'VE GOTTA LIVE A GOOD CLEAN LIFE 
I MEAN YOU KNOW MY MOTHER WAS STRICT WITH US SO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW AND I MEAN I'VE NEVER LOST MY MANNERS YES SIR NO SIR YOU KNOW I NEVER GO HUH 
HAH I MEAN LIKE THEY DO TODAY RIGHT 
AND IT'S THE SAME WITH MY SON AND HIS FAMILY 
I THINK IT'S THE WAY YOU RAISE YOUR CHILD 
YOU KNOW IT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE YOU SEE SO MANY KIDS WHO ARE NOT 
TODAY IT'S TERRIBLE ISN'T IT 
AND THEIR MANNERS THE WAY THEY TALK TO THEIR OWN FAMILY 
WELL YOU SEE I WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT AND NEITHER WOULD MY SON 
AND I THINK THEY LOVE THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER FOR THAT 
THEY CAN'T DO ENOUGH FOR THEM 
THE ADVICE IS OLD FASHIONED BUT MISS MARGUERITE IS A THOROUGHLY MODERN WOMAN INDEPENDENT 
HER HUSBAND WHO WAS AN AMBULANCE DRIVER DIED TWENTY YEARS AGO 
SHE IS FORWARD LOOKING WORKED ALL HER LIFE AND RAISED A SON WHO WITH HIS WIFE HELPS HER STAY BUSY AND INDEPENDENT 
AT THE WOMAN'S INDUSTRIAL EXCHANGE IN BALTIMORE MARGUERITE SPENDS EACH DAY SERVING UP DISHES OF DELICIOUS FOOD PLATES PILED WITH SCOOPS OF FRESH CRAB MEAT SALAD CHICKEN AND THEN CHECKING TO SEE THAT HER CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED 
NOT THE STUFF OF MOVIES MAYBE BUT THE WAY SHE TELLS IT IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE 
YOU HAVING SOMETHING ELSE 
I GUESS WE HAVE TO HAVE DESERT DON'T WE 
WE HAVE STRAWBERRY WHIPPED CREAM TEA CAKE AND THE ICE CREAM CHARLOTTE IS OUR FAVORITE DESERT 
IT'S CAKE SPLIT WITH ICE CREAM THEN MORE ICE CREAM AND CAKE CHOCOLATE SAUCE AND WHIPPED CREAM 
OR STRAWBERRY SAUCE 
THAT'S REALLY A POPULAR DESERT 
WHY DON'T YOU SPLIT ONE 
I MEAN WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO 
WE COULD GET ONE 
WHAT'S IT CALLED 
WOMAN'S EXCHANGE CHARLOTTE
