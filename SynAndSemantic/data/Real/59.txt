THE BEFORE AND AFTER IS INCREDIBLE 
IT WAS A PARADISE PRIOR TO AND NOW IT'S A UPPER 
LESS THAN THREE WEEKS AFTER HURRICANE ANDREW HURRICANE INIKI AGAIN DEMONSTRATED TO THE UNITED STATES THE POWER OF WIND 
THIS TIME THE STORM'S EYE ACROSS THE HAWAIIAN ISLAND OF 
ABOUT HALF THE ISLAND'S TWENTY ONE THOUSAND HOMES AND MOST OF ITS TOURIST HOTELS WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED 
THE STORM STRIPPED SOME OF THE ISLAND'S VEGETATION INCLUDING THIS TOURIST ATTRACTION ONCE A TUNNEL OF GREEN 
ORDINARY LIFE WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN 
I DON'T THINK THE BUILDING IS ANY GOOD ANYMORE BUT I WAS TRYING TO HELP FIND MY MOM'S PERSONAL THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE PICTURES AND SOME THINGS THAT SHE TREASURED SO 
SINCE FRIDAY'S STORM NOTHING 
NO ICE 
NO ICE NO WATER NO ELECTRICITY 
IT'S BEEN PRETTY BAD BUT AT LEAST WE GOT A ROOF OVER OUR HEAD AND EVERYBODY'S ALIVE 
THE STORM UPROOTED MORE THAN HALF OF THE ISLAND'S UTILITY POLES AND UTILITY OFFICIALS PREDICTED MONTHS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY 
THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS IS STILL OPTIMISTIC 
REALISTICALLY FOR THE FULL RESTORATION OF POWER WE COULD BE LOOKING UP TO AS MUCH AS FOUR MONTHS 
BUT GENERATORS WERE SOON RUNNING GASOLINE PUMPS FOR WAITING CARS AND RESIDENTS WERE RECEIVING DRY ICE AND FUEL CANISTERS 
PLEASE COOK THIS FOOD EAT IT WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE HOURS OKAY 
THE STORE GAVE AWAY FOOD IT COULDN'T REFRIGERATE AND MAKING A PHONE CALL GETTING WATER EVEN TAKING A SHOWER BECAME COMMUNAL EVENTS 
RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORING ISLANDS SOON BEGAN FLYING IN FOOD GENERATORS AND DIAPERS 
MONEY AIN'T BUYING ANYTHING HERE 
IT'S NEED 
NEIGHBORS WORKED ON ONE ANOTHER'S HOUSES AND SHARED FOOD BEFORE IT ROTTED 
BAND TOGETHER HELP EACH OTHER OUT IT'S NOT LIKE HEY WHERE'S THE GOVERNMENT THIS AND THAT YOU KNOW 
EVERYBODY JUST JUMP IN REALLY 
IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT NEIGHBORHOODS ALL AROUND THE PLACE THEY GO 
EVERYBODY SAYS COME ON OVER BABY HE'S GOT A LOT OF FOOD 
BUT THE GOVERNMENT DID RUSH IN AID PERHAPS BECAUSE OF CRITICISM THAT IT HAD RESPONDED TO SLOWLY TO HURRICANE ANDREW 
SUPPLIES AND TROOPS BEGAN ARRIVING EVEN BEFORE COMMUNITIES ASKED FOR THEM 
THE NATIONAL GUARD AND THE CARRIERS WERE IN HERE LIKE RIGHT NOW 
PRESIDENT BUSH ANNOUNCED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ON A GREATER THAN USUAL SHARE OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN 
MILITARY SUPPLY SHIPS FERRIED EQUIPMENT ONTO BEACHES AND SOME MILITARY FLIGHTS HELPED TOURISTS GET OFF THE ISLAND 
HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS LINED UP AT THE AIRPORT LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT 
AT LEAST IN FLORIDA IF YOU HAD A CAR YOU COULD DRIVE OUT 
HERE WE HAVE A CAR AND THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO 
TOURISM IS MAIN ATTRACTION AND GETTING HOTELS REPAIRED AND RUNNING WILL BE THE KEY TO THE ISLAND'S LONG TERM RECOVERY 
WHEN PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SAY WHAT CAN WE SEND SEND YOUR VISITORS SEND YOUR TOURISTS AS SOON AS WE'RE OPEN BECAUSE THAT WILL REALLY HELP US AND WE HAVE A WONDERFUL ISLAND TO SHARE 
BUT THIS WEEK TOURIST HOTELS WERE SERVING AS LUXURIOUS BUT POWERLESS EMERGENCY SHELTERS 
IN SOUTH FLORIDA THE SENSE OF EMERGENCY IS EASY 
INVESTIGATORS INCLUDING A STATE GRAND JURY ARE SEARCHING FOR CLUES ABOUT WHETHER WIDE SPREAD BUILDING CODE VIOLATIONS CONTRIBUTED TO HURRICANE ANDREW'S DAMAGE 
WEATHER FORECASTERS COMPLETED AN INITIAL REPORT ON THE STORM SAYING IT WAS LIKE A THIRTY MILE WIDE TORNADO 
SOUTH DADE COUNTRY RESIDENTS WELCOMED SIGNS OF THE SLOW RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE SUCH AS THE BELATED OPENING OF SCHOOLS ON MONDAY 
SCHOOL WAS STILL AN ORDEAL BECAUSE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE IS FORCING MANY SCHOOL BUILDINGS TO DO DOUBLE DUTY WITH CLASSES FOR DIFFERENT SCHOOLS STACKED MORNING AND AFTERNOON 
THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC IN ALMOST ALL CLASSROOMS WAS ANDREW 
HOW MANY WERE AWAKE THROUGH THE WHOLE THING 
THE OPENING OF SCHOOLS WAS A SIGNAL FOR SOME MILITARY UNITS TO BEGIN TO WITHDRAW FROM THE AREA AS EMERGENCY RELIEF GIVES WAY TO WHAT PROMISES TO BE A LONG SLOW CLIMB TO RECOVERY
