THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH KENNEDY ONASSIS 
BOTH CLINTONS IN FACT WERE DEEPLY EFFECTED BY THE KENNEDY LEGACY 
C. N. N. SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT WOLF BLITZER REPORTS 
THE KENNEDYS HAVE MEANT A LOT TO BILL CLINTON SOMETHING KENNEDY ONASSIS UNDERSTOOD AND WELCOMED 
AS A TEENAGER HE CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MEET PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN THE ROSE GARDEN AND HE SAYS HE WAS DEEPLY EFFECTED 
INDEED ON THE MORNING OF HIS OWN INAUGURATION MR. CLINTON WENT FIRST TO ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY TO LAY A WREATH AT THE KENNEDY GRAVE SITE 
HE WAS JOINED BY SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY THE LATE PRESIDENT'S YOUNGEST BROTHER 
LAST OCTOBER MR. CLINTON WAS ABLE TO KEEP UP THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONSHIP JOINING MRS. ONASSIS AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AT THE DEDICATION OF A NEW WING OF THE JOHN F. KENNEDY PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN BOSTON 
HE INSPIRED MILLIONS OF US TO TAKE A VERY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY MOVING OUR COUNTRY FORWARD AND FOR ADVANCING THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
TO MANY OBSERVERS THE CLINTON AND KENNEDY PRESIDENCIES SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IN COMMON TWO YOUNG AND ENERGETIC MEN TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
THE TWO FIRST LADIES ALSO SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENT ERAS YOUTH A COUNTRY'S FASCINATION AND YOUNG CHILDREN LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE UNDER THE CONSTANT GLARE OF CAMERAS 
I'VE ALSO HAD WONDERFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS WHOM I ADMIRE GREATLY AND WHOM I'VE TALKED WITH ABOUT HOW SHE PROTECTED HER CHILDREN AND WHAT SHE DID TO GIVE THEM A NORMAL LIFE 
LAST SUMMER THE CLINTON KENNEDY CONNECTION WAS STRENGTHENED WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND WERE INVITED TO GO BOATING WITH MRS. ONASSIS AND HER LONG TIME COMPANION MAURICE AND THEIR FAMILIES 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE AND MRS. CLINTON ARE GRATEFUL TO MRS. ONASSIS 
SHE'S BEEN QUITE WONDERFUL TO MY WIFE AND TO MY DAUGHTER AND TO ALL OF US 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SHOW THEIR ADMIRATION FOR MRS. ONASSIS BY ATTENDING HER FUNERAL
