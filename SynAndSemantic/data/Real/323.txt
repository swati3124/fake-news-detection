STILL HAVING TO DO WITH WHITEWATER SHREDDING HAS ENTERED THE POPULAR CULTURE AGAIN 
IT IS THERE BECAUSE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHITEWATER FILES OR FILES PERHAPS HAVING TO DO WITH WHITEWATER WHICH WERE SHREDDED 
IT IS TRUE THAT SOME FILES FROM THE ROSE LAW FIRM IN LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS WERE SHREDDED THOUGH THERE'S A REAL QUESTION AS TO WHOM THEY BELONGED TO 
IT HASN'T STOPPED SPECULATION NOR EVEN SOME SARCASM 
HERE'S THE EDITORIAL PAGE IN LAST SUNDAY'S ARKANSAS GAZETTE 
TODAY'S WHITEWATER CARTOON IT SAYS WAS SHREDDED BY THE ROSE LAW FIRM 
WELL JUST THE WORD SHREDDING UP IMAGES OF WRONGDOING 
BUT CYNTHIA MCFADDEN WHO REPORTS ON LEGAL ISSUES FOR US SAYS SOMETIMES YES SOMETIMES NO 
SOMETIMES SHREDDING IS HEROIC 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AT THE U. S. EMBASSY IN IRAN DIPLOMATS USED A SHREDDER TO DESTROY DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE EMBASSY WAS TAKEN OVER BY ISLAMIC MILITANTS 
SOMETIMES SHREDDING IS SUSPICIOUS 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN OLIVER NORTH SHREDDED SO MANY IRAN CONTRA DOCUMENTS AND DID IT SO FAST THAT INVESTIGATORS FOUND OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE SHREDDER JAMMED 
SOMETIMES SHREDDING IS MERELY ROUTINE 
THE SIMPLE FACT OF DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN ANYTHING WHICH WAS DONE WAS WRONG 
NOW WE HAVE WHITEWATER 
AND ALL AGREE THE ROSE LAW FIRM SHREDDED DOCUMENTS 
TWO FORMER EMPLOYEES TOLD A. B. C. NEWS THAT THEY SHREDDED DOCUMENTS BELONGING TO VINCE FOSTER WHOSE DEATH AT THE TIME WAS KNOWN TO BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT FISKE 
THE SHREDDING ITSELF HAS ALREADY CAUSED POLITICAL PROBLEMS 
BUT WHAT ABOUT LEGAL PROBLEMS 
THE ANSWER IT DEPENDS 
IF THE DOCUMENT IS UNDER SUBPOENA OR IF IT HAS BEEN NOTICED IN DISCOVERY IF THE PERSON KNOWS THAT IT IS RELEVANT TO AN ONGOING JUDICIAL PROCEEDING AND MEANS TO PREVENT ITS USE IN THAT PROCEEDING THAT WOULD BE CRIMINAL 
THE ROSE LAW FIRM SAYS NOTHING WAS DESTROYED THAT HAD TO DO WITH WHITEWATER OR VINCE FOSTER 
BUT EVEN SO EXPERTS SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT A LIST OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE DESTROYED AND HAD SOMEONE WITNESS THE SHREDDING 
ANY LAWYER WITH FIVE WORTH OF THOUGHT CAN REALIZE THAT A DESTRUCTION AT THIS CRITICAL PERIOD WILL ULTIMATELY BE INVESTIGATED AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU DID NOTHING WRONG 
SO FAR NO WORD FROM THE FIRM ON WHETHER SUCH A LIST EXISTS 
THE FIRST REAL SHREDDER WAS DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE AT THE REQUEST OF ADOLF HITLER WHO WANTED A DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION PROGRAM HE COULD RELY ON 
THE WORLD WOULD SOON GO FROM THIS TO THIS 
THE LEGAL BOTTOM LINE ON SHREDDING SHREDDING IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF MAKING GARBAGE EXCEPT AT SOME POINT CREATING THIS KIND OF GARBAGE MAY VIOLATE THE LAW
