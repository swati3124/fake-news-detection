DRUG PRICES ALSO UNDER PRESSURE 
DRUG MAKERS TURNING OUT LOW COST VERSIONS OF THE SOME OF THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST 
THE LATEST EXAMPLE IS 
THE PATENT ON ITS POPULAR ANTI ULCER DRUG TAGAMET EXPIRED TUESDAY OPENING THE DOOR TO A FLOOD OF GENERIC 
BUT AS TERRY KEENAN REPORTS REFUSES TO BACK DOWN 
GENERIC VERSIONS OF TAGAMET WERE BEING SHIPPED TO PHARMACIES WEDNESDAY ONE DAY AFTER ITS PATENT EXPIRED 
BUT ALONG WITH THOSE SHIPMENTS WAS OWN LOW COST SUBSTITUTE FOR ITS POPULAR ANTI ULCER DRUG 
LIKE MANY BIG DRUG COMPANIES IS GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE GENERIC COMPETITION AND ANALYSTS SAY WITH LITTLE CHOICE 
PREVIOUSLY IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT TWO YEARS TO LOSE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF YOUR SALES WHEN WE WERE NOT IN SUCH PERIOD OF HEALTHCARE COST CONTAINMENT 
BUT THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE 
WITH COMPETITION FIERCE AND PATIENTS PRICE CONSCIOUS PRICES DOWN DROP SHARPLY SOON AFTER A PATENT EXPIRES 
THE PRICE OF FELL EIGHTY PERCENT JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER IT LOST PATENT PROTECTION LAST YEAR 
TODAY FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED ARE FOR GENERIC DRUGS UP SHARPLY FROM TEN YEARS AGO 
BUT IT'S THE OF THE WORLD NOT THEIR GENERIC COMPETITORS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CASH IN ON THE SHIFT TO 
JUST ABOUT EVERY MAJOR DRUG COMPANY NOW HAS ITS OWN GENERIC UNIT AND LARGE BUYERS SUCH AS H. M. O.'S ARE TAKING NOTICE 
DRUG COMPANIES ARE NOW BUNDLING TOGETHER THEIR BRAND NAME AND GENERIC DRUGS OFFERING THEM AT A SPECIAL PRICE 
THEY WILL BE SO PRICE COMPETITIVE THAT THEY WILL RETAIN ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT PARTICULAR MARKET 
THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE VERY VERY LITTLE BUSINESS TO EXISTING GENERIC DRUG PRODUCERS 
IT'S GOING TO PUT TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON THEIR PROFIT MARGINS AND I THINK EXPECTATIONS ON WALL STREET ARE NOT GOING TO BE MET 
AND THE STAKES FOR MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE TO GROW 
BY THE END OF THE DECADE TWO HUNDRED MORE DRUGS WITH TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES WILL BE COMING OFF PATENT
