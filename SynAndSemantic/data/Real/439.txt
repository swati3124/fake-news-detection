HENRY WAS LIKE A FATHER TO ME

DETAILS OF THE LIFE THIS WOMAN SAYS SHE LIVED THE PAST TWELVE YEARS ARE AS BIZARRE AS THE LIFE HENRY LEE LUCAS SAYS HE LIVED 
SHE RAN AWAY FROM HENRY LEE LUCAS IN TEXAS IN AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO SHE SAYS RAN AWAY WITH A TRUCK DRIVER NAMED KURT AND FOR THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS TOOK ON A NEW IDENTITY 
I WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD BE IMPLICATED IN ON THE MURDERS THAT HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF 
AS PHYLLIS THIS WOMAN SPENT TIME ON THE ROAD WITH THE AND ENDED UP IN CAPE MISSOURI 
POLICE SAY COURT RECORDS QUESTION THE DATES IN HER STORY 
THEY SAY A KURT AND PHYLLIS MARRIED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
BECKY POWELL WOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT YEARS OLD 
WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THIS WOMAN BEGAN WRITING HENRY LEE LUCAS ON TEXAS DEATH ROW IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
LATER SHE SURPRISED HIM WITH A VISIT 
I SAID HI HENRY I'M BACK 
SHE SAYS SHE MADE LUCAS PROMISE HE WOULD NOT REVEAL WHAT SHE CALLS HER CHARADE 
I VISITED WITH HIM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND I MADE HIM PROMISE ME THAT HE WOULD NOT TELL ANYBODY WHO I AM AND HE PROMISED 
THAT CHARADE EVEN TOOK HER TO NETWORK TELEVISION POSING AS PHYLLIS A HENRY LEE LUCAS GROUPIE ON GERALDO NOW IT CAN BE TOLD
