SMALL BUSINESS LOANS SINK WITH STIMULUS PACKAGE 
WELL THE GOVERNMENT'S LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM HAS RUN INTO SOME DIFFICULTY THAT PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ABOUT TO RUN OUT OF MONEY 
FUNDS TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM THROUGH SEPTEMBER DIED IN THE SENATE ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE PRESIDENT'S STIMULUS PACKAGE 
IRV CHAPMAN REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON 
A START UP MANUFACTURING COMPANY EXPANSION OF A TRUCKING FIRM A SHUTTERED MOTEL THAT WAS REOPENED AND REHABILITATED TYPICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED SMALL BUSINESS LOANS RECENTLY MADE IN A TOWN LIKE FARGO NORTH DAKOTA 
IT'S A WAY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE CREDIT WITH VERY LITTLE RISK AND IT GIVES THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE LOANS PROBABLY THAT THEY WOULD NOT OTHERWISE MAKE AND LESSEN THEIR RISK THROUGH THE GUARANTEES 
AFTER BACKING THREE BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOANS SINCE OCTOBER THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REACHED ITS LIMIT 
IF THAT'S BAD NEWS THE GOOD NEWS IF THE MAJOR REASON FOR IT ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT 
IF THE ECONOMY TURNS DOWN A SMALL BUSINESS CLIENT USUALLY IS THE FIRST TO FALL 
BUT IN THE SAME TOKEN WHEN THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO TURN UP THE SMALL BUSINESS CLIENT IS THE FIRST OR THE LEADER TO COME OUT OF THAT ECONOMY 
PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD ASKED CONGRESS TO ALLOW TWO BILLION FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS IN LENDING BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT OCTOBER FIRST BUT HE PUT IT INTO THE BILL THAT DIED BY FILIBUSTER 
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS BEING STUBBORN ABOUT IT TO MAKE A POINT 
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE ONE OF THE FEW GOOD THINGS THAT REPUBLICANS SUPPORT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF IT TO EMBARRASS REPUBLICANS 
IN FACT CONGRESS WOULD ONLY HAVE TO APPROPRIATE ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FINANCE A FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT RESERVE FOR 
THE ACTUAL LOAN MONEY COMES FROM THE BANKS 
SMALL BUSINESS HAS LONG BEEN A FAVORED CONSTITUENCY HERE ON CAPITOL HILL NEVER MORE THAN RIGHT NOW WHEN SMALL BUSINESSES ACCOUNT FOR A MAJORITY OF THE NEW JOBS CREATED 
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT FOR CONGRESS TO COME UP WITH A BI PARTISAN RESCUE OF THE LOAN PROGRAM
