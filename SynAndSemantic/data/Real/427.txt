WELL COLD WATER AND STORMY WEATHER ARE MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO FIND SURVIVORS OF A PASSENGER FERRY IN THE BALTIC SEA 
THE ESTONIA WENT DOWN OFF COAST WITH EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN PASSENGERS AND CREW ON BOARD 
RESCUERS FROM SWEDEN AND FINLAND SPENT THE NIGHT SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS AND TAKING THEM TO HOSPITALS 
THE FERRY WAS TRAVELING FROM CAPITAL TO STOCKHOLM SWEDEN 
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT IT SENT OUT A DISTRESS CALL THAT IT WAS LISTING BADLY 
AND JOINING US NOW FROM HELSINKI IS FREELANCE JOURNALIST TERRY SCHULTZ 
TERRY 
THANKS FOR JOINING US 
NOW WE'VE HEARD SO MANY CONFLICTING REPORTS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE RESCUED AND CASUALTIES 
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD 
WELL THERE HAS BEEN A WIDELY QUOTED FIGURE OF NINETY PEOPLE RESCUED AND I DID SOME CHECKING ON THIS WITH THE FINNISH COAST GUARD 
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS NINETY INCLUDES SOME DEAD BODIES AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AT THIS TIME TO PUT AN EXACT FIGURE ON THE AMOUNT OF SURVIVORS BUT I WAS CLEARLY TOLD THAT THIS NINETY IS NOT ALL IS NOT A FIGURE OF ALL LIVING PEOPLE 
AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAG EVEN THE DEAD BODIES OUT OF THE WATER UNFORTUNATELY 
SO THIS NINETY MAY BE A COUNT IN TOTAL OF HOW MANY BODIES THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PULL FROM THE WATER SO FAR DUE TO THE STORM 
I WILL CONTINUE CHECKING ON THIS NUMBER AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALL HOPING THAT IT DOES REACH UP TO NINETY AND BEYOND 
BUT IN ANY CASE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE SOME EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE DEAD IN THE WATERS OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHWESTERN FINLAND 
TERRY DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SOME SUGGESTIONS GIVEN AND OF COURSE THE THE LAST DISTRESS SIGNAL GIVEN BY THE CAPTAIN ALSO GIVES A GOOD IDEA THAT IN FACT THE STORMY WEATHER DID CAUSE THE SHIP TO ROCK VERY VERY HEAVILY AND AS IT WAS SUCH A LARGE SHIP CARRYING MANY CARS AND HEAVY CARGO IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE THAT THE THE CARGO SHIFTED TO ONE SIDE AND JUST PUSHED THE BOAT OVER INTO THE WATER 
AND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN PEOPLE ON BOARD IS IS A HEAVY LOAD 
NOW WILL THIS BAD WEATHER HAMPER RESCUE EFFORTS 
YES THERE HAVE BEEN HELICOPTERS AND CARGO SHIPS AND FERRIES WORKING THROUGHOUT THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AND IN FACT CONTINUING AND THE WEATHER IS JUST TERRIBLE 
THERE HAVE BEEN HEAVY WINDS LIGHTNING RAIN CONTINUING AND IT'S MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH TERRY
