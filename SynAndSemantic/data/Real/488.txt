HE WAS A VIETNAM VETERAN AND A SUCCESSFUL ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE 
BUT BEHIND THE CASKET CARRYING THE BODY OF THOMAS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF HIS LIFE HIS FAMILY HIS WIFE SUSAN THEIR BABY DAUGHTER FIFTEEN MONTH OLD KELLY AND THREE OLDER CHILDREN 
THE FAMILY OF TOM BRUTALLY KILLED WHEN A MAIL BOMB EXPLODED IN HIS HANDS HAD A MESSAGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT 
IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SOURCE OF COMFORT FOR SUSAN AND THE ENTIRE FAMILY TO KNOW THAT TOM WAS SO LOVED AND ADMIRED AND WE THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS

HIS YOUNGER BROTHER SAID THE ONLY WAY HE CAN COPE WITH THIS IS WITH MEMORIES OF HIM 
I DEEPLY MISS MY BROTHER MY FRIEND MY BEST MAN 
TOM WHO IS SEEN IN THIS CORPORATE VIDEO WAS RECENTLY PROMOTED TO GENERAL MANAGER OF YOUNG AND BY THE AGENCY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHO SPOKE AT THE MASS 
I WOULD WALK INTO TOM'S OFFICE WEAK AND I WOULD WALK OUT OF HIS OFFICE STRONG 
I WOULD WALK INTO HIS OFFICE INSECURE AND I WOULD WALK OUT OF HIS OFFICE CONFIDENT 
THE MOST POIGNANT MOMENT CAME WHEN TOM THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER KIM SPOKE 
KIM WAS IN THE HOUSE WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF AND SHE TEARFULLY TOLD THOSE IN THE CHURCH HOW THIS TIME OF YEAR MEANT SO MUCH TO HER FATHER 
MY DAD'S FAVORITE THING TO DO WAS TO GATHER HIS FAMILY AROUND OUR PIANO AND SING CHRISTMAS CAROLS ESPECIALLY O. HOLY NIGHT 
AND THEN KIM ASKED EVERYONE TO SING O. HOLY NIGHT ONE LAST TIME FOR HER FATHER 
TOM WAS ONLY FIFTY YEARS OLD AND WHILE MANY GRIEVE THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISERY REMAINS AT LARGE
