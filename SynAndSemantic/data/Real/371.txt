ANIMALS DO THE DARNEDEST THINGS AND BEARS ARE NO EXCEPTION 
THINGS WERE UP IN THE AIR IN VIRGINIA BEACH VIRGINIA THIS WEEK WHEN RESIDENTS DISCOVERED THIS BEAR UP A TREE 
I MEAN IT WAS REALLY WEIRD TO SEE IT IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA LIKE THAT 
THE BEAR SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING HIS PERCH BUT OFFICERS WANTED HIM DOWN 
SO THEY FIRED A DART AND THE BEAR FELL TO THE EARTH 
WILDLIFE EXPERTS THEORIZE IT CAME FROM A NEARBY SWAMP SO THEY TOOK HIM BACK HOME AFTER AN EXAMINATION COULD BEAR OUT 
THE SLEEPY INTRUDER WAS O. K. 
PEOPLE CAN DROP PRECIPITOUSLY TOO LIKE WHEN THEY'RE ON A RIP ROARING WATER SLIDE 
NOW THERE'S A NEW DESIGN THAT TURNS CONVENTION UPSIDE DOWN A WATER SLIDE THAT SENDS PEOPLE UPHILL 
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE THE WET AND WILD DROP OF A WATER SLIDE AND THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE THIS SLIDE 
IT CAN ALSO BLAST RIDERS UPHILL 
SLIDING UPHILL 
ISAAC NEWTON IS SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE 
IT'S A NEW SLIDE CALLED THE MASTER 
IT'S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER ON H. TWO O. POWERFUL WATER JETS OR CAN EASILY BOOST TWO PEOPLE UP A FIFTEEN DEGREE 
THE INVENTOR TOM SAYS IT'S UNLIKE ANY OTHER WATER SLIDE 
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE MASTER IS WHEN YOU GET IN THE TUBE AND YOU START AND YOU HIT THE FIRST THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE IS THE THE SENSATION 
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT THING HITS YOU AND IT JUST PICKS YOU UP AND YOU GO WHOA 
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE YOU FEEL THIS THING WHICH IS UNKNOWN 
YOU HAVEN'T FELT THAT EXPERIENCE BEFORE 
ACTUALLY HAS MADE A RIDE THAT'S SIMILAR TO THE MASTER 
THE FLOW RIDER SIMULATES SURFING WITH SHEETS OF WATER SENT OVER A SPECIALLY SHAPED HILL 
HAS SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING HIS RIDES 
BESIDES DESIGNING THEM HE ALSO SERVED AS TEST PILOT WHICH DURING THE EARLY DAYS CALLED FOR PROTECTIVE GEAR 
WHILE THE IDEA MAY SEEM SIMPLE MAKING THE MASTER WORK TOOK SOME CAREFUL ENGINEERING 
WE'RE BRINGING THE WATER UPHILL 
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO VENT THAT WATER BECAUSE AS THE WATER SLOWS DOWN IT WANTS TO PUDDLE UP 
AND THAT'S WHAT TOOK US SO LONG TO PERFECT 
VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THAT PROPER BALANCE BUT WE'VE DONE IT NOW 
SO WE'RE EXCITED 
RIDERS CAN GO SOLO OR IN 
EITHER WAY THEY HIT WATER RUSHING AT A RATE OF OVER TWENTY GALLONS A SECOND 
BESIDES THE FUN FACTOR THE WATER ALSO KEEPS RIDERS FROM UP 
THE PARK OWNER SAYS THE MASTER HAS POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE WAY WATER PARKS WORK 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO AWAY WITH STARTING PLATFORMS AND REALLY ELIMINATE THE LONG WAITS THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCUSTOMED TO WATER SLIDES 
THE FIRST MASTER OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IS AT THE WATER PARK IN TEXAS WHICH HELPED DESIGN AND BUILD THE RIDE 
OTHER PARKS IN THE U. S. AND AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED INTEREST 
SO ROLL OVER NEWTON 
WATER RIDES LIKE THIS SEEM TO BE TAKING OFF 
TIME FOR US TO SLIP SLIDE AWAY 
THANKS FOR WATCHING 
I'M MILES O'BRIEN 
EVER WONDER WHAT THE INSIDE OF A DINOSAUR SKULL LOOKS LIKE
