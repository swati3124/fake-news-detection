COMING UP ON ALL THINGS CONSIDERED AN EDITOR OF THE RUSSIAN NEWSPAPER PRAVDA SAYS BORIS YELTSIN'S DECISION TO BAN THE PAPER IS PURELY 
SOME STUDENTS AND PARENTS IN BETHLEHEM PENNSYLVANIA SAY MANDATORY COMMUNITY SERVICE IS NOTHING BUT SLAVERY IN DISGUISE AND PAUL SIMON WITH AND WITHOUT 
STAY TUNED 
RESIDENTS OF MOSCOW WILL HAVE TO LIVE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR AT LEAST ONE MORE WEEK 
THAT WORD TODAY FROM RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN 
IT HAS BEEN SIX DAYS SINCE YELTSIN PUT DOWN AN ARMED INSURRECTION AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT AND AMONG THE MEASURES HE TOOK TO CONSOLIDATE HIS RULE WAS THE SHUT DOWN OF A HANDFUL OF ANTI YELTSIN NEWSPAPERS 
AMONG THEM IS PRAVDA THE PRO COMMUNIST NEWSPAPER 
VIKTOR IS DEPUTY EDITOR IN CHIEF 
IT'S A PURELY I THINK MEASURE 
WE'RE WITNESSING AT THE MOMENT YOU KNOW SO MANY VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION BROUGHT BY YELTSIN AND HIS GOVERNMENT THAT BANNING PRAVDA OR I SHOULD SAY SUSPENDING IT FOR A WHILE IS LOOKS LIKE A VERY MINOR THING 
THERE ARE ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED ARRESTED PEOPLE STILL IN CUSTODY THAT IS AFTER THE SIEGE OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED DEAD AS WE KNOW AND THERE IS MANY MANY HUNDREDS WOUNDED 
IF YOUR NEWSPAPER WERE BEING PUBLISHED RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU BE WRITING 
YOU KNOW WE THE WEST IS APPLAUDING DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA BUT WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS WE HAVE CENSORSHIP OF THE OLD COMMUNIST DAYS 
WE HAVE ACTUALLY BASICALLY A COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP OF BREZHNEV STRIPE IN WHICH WE HAVE NO PARLIAMENT WHERE WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION NO OPPOSITION PRESS AND SO ON 
SO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT PRAVDA TO WRITE 
IT'LL BE A VERY VERY DREARY EXISTENCE I SHOULD SAY FOR A NEWSPAPER 
THAT IS PURPORTING TO WRITE TRUTH ABOUT EVENTS 
WELL WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OPPOSITION VOICE IN RUSSIA NOW 
WILL IT GO UNDERGROUND 
THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW YELTSIN FORCES IS PUSHING IT TO GO BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY'RE BANNING ALL THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION 
THEY WANT TO HAVE A SO CALLED TOY OPPOSITION OR A POCKET OPPOSITION I SHOULD SAY ONE THAT CAN DO NO HARM TO THEM AT ALL 
BUT THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION IS BANNED EFFECTIVELY 
IT CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS 
IT CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE ELECTIONS 
THIS IS THE EFFECT WHAT YOU KNOW YELTSIN'S BAN EFFECTIVELY DOES AND IN THIS LIGHT YOU KNOW OF COURSE ROLE IS ON THE ONE HAND IS VERY IMPORTANT 
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THE CENSORSHIP THE YELTSIN REGIME IMPOSED 
THE ELECTIONS ARE IN DECEMBER 
DO YOU EXPECT THAT PRAVDA WILL BE PUBLISHING SOMETIME BEFORE THOSE ELECTIONS SO THAT IN FACT THE OPPOSITION MAY HAVE A VOICE WHEN THOSE ELECTIONS ARE HELD 
YES 
I THINK OF COURSE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT PROBABLY PRAVDA WILL BE PUBLISHED BEFORE ELECTIONS 
ACTUALLY WE EXPECT TO PUBLISH AS SOON PROBABLY AS YOU KNOW WITHIN A WEEK OR MAYBE TWO WEEKS 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WITH THE TOTAL MONOPOLY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE YELTSIN GOVERNMENT ON TELEVISION WITH THE TOTAL MONOPOLY ALMOST TOTAL MONOPOLY I SHOULD SAY ON THE WRITING MEDIA WHATEVER CHANNEL THAT PRAVDA PROVIDES FOR THE OPPOSITION WOULD BE A VERY LIMITED ONE 
AND GIVEN THE DISARRAY THAT THE OPPOSITION OR WHATEVER THE CENTER IN THE COUNTRY ARE IN AFTER THE EVENTS THE TRAGEDY OF THE WHITE HOUSE I THINK IT'LL BE IT LOOKS LIKE A TRAVESTY OF ELECTION BASICALLY 
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT PRAVDA HAS BEEN BANNED THOUGH IN RECENT YEARS IS IT 
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU KNOW SINCE AUGUST OF NINETY ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN STOPPED 
AND WHO ISSUED THE ORDER THE FIRST TIME 
I THINK ACTUALLY IRONICALLY THIS IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE IRONIES OF OUR TIME 
IRONICALLY THE FIRST TIME THE LIST FOR SUSPENSION WAS MADE UP BY KHASBULATOV AND I WAS VERY PLEASE THAT PRAVDA WAS ON THAT LIST 
THAT IS THE KHASBULATOV WHO IS NOW INCARCERATED BY YELTSIN HIS ERSTWHILE SUPPORTER AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE ERSTWHILE DEMOCRATS OF THE NINETY ONE COUP
