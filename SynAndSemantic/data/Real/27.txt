THE ACTION IS HEATING UP IN MOVIE THEATERS AS THE BLOCK BUSTER SUMMER FILMS BEGIN ARRIVING 
PARAMOUNT'S BIG GUN IS A SEQUEL OF SORTS TO THE HUNT FOR RED ALL THIS WEEK C. N. N.'S DENNIS MICHAEL PREVIEWS PATRIOT GAMES 
ACTION 
ACTION 
FOR PATRIOT GAMES IT'S WORTH SAYING THE WORD TWICE 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ACTION IN THIS TALE OF REVENGE AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WITH BATTLES ON LAND ON SEA AND BY AIR FROM THE DESERTS OF NORTH AFRICA TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
WELL NOT ACTUALLY BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
WE SHOT THAT AT LONDON AT THE GREENWICH NAVAL COLLEGE OUTSIDE OF LONDON 
WE WERE SURROUNDED BY FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND SIXTEENTH CENTURY BUILDINGS WITH THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS IN THEM GLASS AND AS THEY SAY GOD FORBID WE HAD THE EXPLOSION HAD KNOCKED PICTURES OFF THE WALLS OR BROKEN ANY OF THESE WINDOWS 
BROKEN GLASS IS ONE THING BUT MULTI MILLION DOLLAR TALENT LIKE HARRISON FORD AND ANNE ARCHER IN THE LINE OF FIRE IS AN EVEN GREATER CONCERN 
THIS SOMETIMES MAKES YOU A BIT NERVOUS BUT HE PREFERS TO FALL AND JUMP AND CRASH AND BE THERE WHEN THE EXPLOSION GOES OFF SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE HIS FACE 
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD HIM THAT IF THE ACTING THING DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT I CAN USE HIM AS A AND HE'S REALLY GOOD 
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH ACTION FOR SAKE IN THE FILM BUT IN PATRIOT DIRECTOR PHILLIP WAS CAREFUL TO HAVE ALL ACTION DEVELOPED OUT OF CHARACTER SUCH AS THIS SCENE AS JACK IS STALKED BY AN ASSASSIN 
WE GO THROUGH JACK'S THOUGHT PROCESS AS HE FIRST OF ALL THE PRESENCE OF THIS MAN AND THEN WORKS OUT HOW HE'S GOING TO FOIL THE ATTACK WITHOUT GETTING INJURED HIMSELF AND AFTERWARDS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MAN ACTUALLY ATTACKING HIM MIGHT BE FOR HIS OWN FAMILY 
SO ALL OF THE ACTION SEQUENCES TRY AND REVEAL JACK RYAN'S CHARACTER 
PATRIOT MAKES ITS EXPLOSIVE DEBUT ON JUNE FIFTH IN THEATERS THROUGHOUT THE U. S. AND CANADA
