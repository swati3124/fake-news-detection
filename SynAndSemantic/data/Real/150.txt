SOMETIMES THE MOST AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN THAT YOU DON'T EXPECT 
RECENTLY ONE OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY THS CAMERA CREWS WAS AT A HOSPITAL PREPARING A PIECE ON HEART DISEASE WHEN A YOUNG CHILD WAS RUSHED IN IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
HE HAD SUSTAINED A SEVERE HEAD INJURY AND YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MORE CHILDREN DIE FROM HEAD INJURIES THAN FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE 
AND WE THEN WATCHED ANXIOUSLY AS THIS DRAMA UNFOLDED RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND WE DOUBT YOU'VE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
FOLLOW DOCTOR TIMOTHY JOHNSON THROUGH THIS MINUTE BY MINUTE ACCOUNT AS WE LEARN HOW AN EMERGENCY ROOM TEAM SPRINGS INTO ACTION TO SAVE THE LIFE OF ONE LITTLE BOY 
AT SIX FIFTY P. M. ON THURSDAY MARCH ELEVENTH AN AMBULANCE BROUGHT SIX YEAR OLD CRAIG TO THIS SUBURBAN CHICAGO EMERGENCY ROOM 
CRAIG'S PARENTS ARE OUT OF TOWN SO HIS AUNT AND UNCLE CALLED AN AMBULANCE AFTER CRAIG FELL ON HIS HEAD AND LOST CONSCIOUSNESS 
CRAIG'S FATE IS UNCERTAIN 
HE IS STILL UNCONSCIOUS 
HE COULD DIE WITHIN MINUTES OR HE MIGHT LIVE BUT NEVER COME OUT OF THE COMA 
CRAIG IS NOT BREATHING ON HIS OWN SO DOCTORS AT CHRIST HOSPITAL ARE BREATHING FOR HIM WITH THIS BLUE BAG KNOWN AND AN BAG 
RIGHT AWAY DOCTOR LEIF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RESIDENT IN HIS SECOND YEAR OF TRAINING NEEDS SOME ANSWERS 
FOR EXAMPLE DID THE FALL NOT ONLY INJURE CRAIG'S BRAIN BUT ALSO BREAK HIS NECK 
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HE ORDERS X. RAYS OF THE CERVICAL SPINE 
CAN WE SHOOT A C. SPINE SOMETIME 
WHILE THE X. RAY MACHINE IS POSITIONED ANOTHER RESIDENT TRIES TO SEE IF CRAIG WILL RESPOND 
HEY CRAIG 
CRAIG 
THERE IS NO RESPONSE 
A VENTILATOR THAT WILL SUPPLY OXYGEN MORE EFFICIENTLY IS QUICKLY BROUGHT TO THE ROOM 
AT SEVEN TEN SUDDENLY THERE IS A NEW PROBLEM 
CRAIG IS HAVING A SEIZURE 
AND HE'S GOT FACIAL AND JERKING OF ALL SORTS FROM THIS 
IF IT CONTINUES THE SEIZURE COULD CAUSE MORE BRAIN DAMAGE SO DOCTOR QUICKLY ORDERS TO STOP THE SEIZURE 
AFTER THE X. RAY IS TAKEN DOCTOR ER WITH DOCTOR MICHAEL LAMBERT THE SENIOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIAN AND ONE OF THE HOSPITAL REVEREND 
AS HE CALLS CRAIG'S PARENTS LONG DISTANCE ALL DOCTOR KNOWS IS THAT CRAIG FELL WHILE HE WAS PLAYING IN HIS BASEMENT WHEN HE AUNT WAS UPSTAIRS 
MA'AM I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT OKAY 
THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO MISLEAD YOU AND TELL YOU HE'S OKAY RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE I THINK HE'S IN SERIOUS CONDITION 
BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME UNTIL I SEE EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING I CAN'T TELL YOU A WHOLE LOT MORE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT 
DOCTOR HAS FEW ANSWERS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A CAT SCAN OF CRAIG'S BRAIN A VITAL PIECE OF INFORMATION IN HEAD INJURY CASES 
IT IS NOW SEVEN EIGHTEEN 
AS CRAIG IS WHEELED TOWARD THE SCAN ROOM DOCTOR VOICES SOME FRUSTRATION 
DO WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
THE SCAN IS CRITICAL 
IT WILL TELL DOCTORS WHETHER CRAIG NEEDS EMERGENCY SURGERY TO STOP ANY BLEEDING IN HIS BRAIN OR WHETHER ANY BLEEDING IS SO BAD IT COULDN'T BE CORRECTED WITH SURGERY 
IF THERE IS BLEEDING CRAIG COULD DIE OR BE IN A VEGETATIVE STATE THE REST OF HIS LIFE OR FACE DANGEROUS SURGERY ON HIS BRAIN 
LIKE MANY HEAD INJURY CASES AT THIS POINT THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS 
SEVEN TWENTY SIX NOW THAT THEY KNOW CRAIG'S NECK IS NOT BROKEN DOCTORS MOVE TO GET THE SCAN QUICKLY 
CRAIG IS HOOKED UP TO SEVERAL INTRAVENOUS TUBES AND THE VENTILATOR SO HE HAS TO BE MOVED CAREFULLY TO THE TABLE 
BLOOD STUDIES IMPORTANT STUDIES IN HEAD INJURIES SUGGEST CRAIG WAS NOT BREATHING FOR SOME TIME AFTER HE FELL SO GIVING OXYGEN IS VITAL 
THE TUBE WHICH WAS INSERTED DOWN INTO CRAIG'S BREATHING SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL TO SUPPLYING HIM WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OXYGEN 
IF THE TUBE IS NOT PLACED PROPERLY HE COULD GET INADEQUATE OXYGEN 
HOW FAR DO THEY PULL BACK THE TUBE 
THREE OR FOUR CENTIMETERS 
DID YOU PULL IT BACK AND GIVE HIM THIS 
I PULLED BACK YEAH A REALLY GOOD WAYS 
CAUSE HE HAS A PO TWO OF SIXTY ON THAT LAST GAS 
OKAY LOOK 
HERE LOOK 
TAKE A 
NO IT'S FINE 
I MEAN IS HE WELL WHEN YOU LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES 
I DIDN'T RELY LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES 
LET'S LISTEN AGAIN AND JUST MAKE SURE 
THE FACES OF THE DOCTORS NURSES AND TECHNICIANS 
THEY ARE CLEARLY WORRIED ABOUT CRAIG 
AT FIRST SOME GOOD NEWS 
THE SCANS INDICATE THAT SURGERY BECAUSE THERE IS NO BLEEDING THAT CAN BE CORRECTED 
BUT THEN SOME FRIGHTENING PICTURES THAT APPEAR TO SHAKE DOCTOR 
THE SCANS SUGGEST A HORRIBLE POSSIBILITY A MASSIVE BLEEDING THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN TISSUE ITSELF 
IF THAT'S HAPPENED SURGERY CAN'T HELP AND CRAIG'S PROGNOSIS IS GRIM 
THIS KIND OF BLEEDING IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS 
IT'S INTERESTING THOUGH 
IT'S ALL 
NOW DOCTOR MUST WAIT 
THE ACTUAL SCANS HAVE TO BE PRINTED OUT 
HE REPORTS THE RESULTS OF THE INITIAL SCAN READING TO DOCTOR LAMBERT AND THEN GOES BACK TO THE GET THE ACTUAL SCANS 
AFTER A BRIEF CHECK DOCTOR WALKS ANXIOUSLY TO RADIOLOGY FOR A CONSULTATION 
AS HE LOOKS AT THE SCANS DOCTOR SEES A THAT COULD BE BLOOD IN THE BRAIN TISSUE BUT NOW HE HAS DOUBTS 
WE GOT A LITTLE GUY A SEVEN YEAR OLD TOOK A FALL OF A WAS SWINGING ON A POLE AND FELL DOWN AND IS UNRESPONSIVE OVER THERE 
WHEN DOCTOR CATHERINE BRYAN CAREFULLY EXAMINES THE SCANS PARTICULARLY THE THAT APPEARED TO BE BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN SHE REACHES A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION 
SHE SAYS THE IS JUST THE COVERING OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE 
IT'S WHAT THEY WERE CALLING AN BLEED OVER HERE 
WHERE 
WHO 
JUST WHEN THEY WERE SKIPPING THROUGH IT THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE OVER THERE WITH SOME LIGHT 
NUMBER 
I THINK THAT'S JUST THE 
FURTHER EXAMINATION OF ADDITIONAL CANS CONFIRMS DOCTOR BRYAN'S CONCLUSION NO BLEEDING 
OKAY GREAT 
IT IS SEVEN FORTY JUST FIFTY MINUTES AFTER CRAIG ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL 
HE HAS PASSED ONE HURDLE HE WILL NOT NEED SURGERY BUT ANOTHER CRITICAL QUESTION REMAINS 
WILL HE EVER WAKE UP 
EVEN WITHOUT BLEEDING THE VITAL CENTERS IN THIS BRAIN MAY HAVE BEEN SO SEVERELY DAMAGED THAT HE MIGHT REMAIN IN A PERMANENT COMA 
THE NEXT DAY CRAIG'S UNCLE AND HIS PARENTS WHO HAD RUSHED BACK FROM OUT OF TOWN COME TO SEE CRAIG AND DOCTOR DAVID 
CRAIG STILL IS UNCONSCIOUS 
HE'S IN CRITICAL CONDITION AND THERE YOU KNOW UNTIL WE SEE THAT THE TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT HIS BRAIN IS FUNCTIONING ADEQUATE WE WILL HAVE TO CALL HIM CRITICAL 
WHEN CRAIG WAS LAYING IN THE BED HE WASN'T RESPONDING 
I WAS SAYING BABY I MOMMY LOVES YOU YOU KNOW GOD LOVES YOU AND HE JUST WAS LIKE HE WASN'T THERE 
COME ON CRAIG 
COME ON BACK TO US HONEY 
AND I'M LIKE GOD I ASK YOU WHEN I PRAY TO BRING HIM BACK AND BRING HIM BACK WITH HIS MIND AND BRING HIM BACK WITH EVERYTHING ALL HIS FUNCTIONS AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW JUST LIKE HE WAS 
BUT I LOOKING AT HIM AND HE WASN'T YOU KNOW HE WASN'T RESPONDING AT ALL 
TRY REAL HARD CRAIG 
TRY REAL HARD TO OPEN YOUR EYES SO YOU CAN SEE US 
TRY REAL HARD 
MR I KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE US 'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN US SINCE WEDNESDAY 
COME ON 
I SAW HIM AND I SAID YOU KNOW GOD THIS IS MY SON LAYING HERE WITH ALL THESE TUBES AND EVERYTHING DOWN HIS THROAT 
AND HE WASN'T BREATHING ON HIS OWN 
AT THIS POINT DOCTORS DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT HE APPARENTLY STUNNED HIS BRAIN AND SUFFERED A SEVERE 
DAY TWO TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER HERE IN THE PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT CRAIG WAS TAKEN OFF THE VENTILATOR 
HE COULD BREATHE ON HIS OWN 
DURING THE NIGHT HE STARTED SHOWING SIGNS OF COMING OUT OF THE COMA 
FOR EXAMPLE HE BECAME AGITATED STARTED MOVING HIS ARMS AND LEGS 
AND AT THREE O'CLOCK A. M. THIRTY FOUR HOURS AFTER HE FELL HIS NURSE WAS FINALLY ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH TO HIM 
I'D ASKED HIM HIS NAME 
HE WASN'T RESPONDING 
HE WAS STARTING TO MOVE AROUND MORE AND I KEPT CONCENTRATING LOOKING AT HIM SAYING WHAT IS YOUR NAME 
HOW OLD ARE YOU 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID I LOVE YOU 
AND I REPEATED THE QUESTIONS 
HE CONTINUED TO MOVE AROUND MORE 
HE WAS FOLLOWING MY EYE CONTACT AND JUST REPEATED AGAIN I LOVE YOU 
WASN'T THAT A LITTLE UNUSUAL 
YES 
YES IT WAS 
IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE UNIT AT THE TIME 
HE WOKE UP AND AT THAT MOMENT WE HE WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HIS MOTHER INTERMITTENTLY NOT CONSTANTLY AND SO WE KNEW THAT HIS HEAD INJURY ALBEIT IT HAD BEEN SEVERE WAS MOST LIKELY GOING TO IMPROVE 
ON DAY FOUR CRAIG WAS MOVED OUT OF THE PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SO HE COULD BEGIN THE LONG AND CRITICAL PROCESS OF REHABILITATION MUCH OF IT TO HAPPEN RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM 
BUT AS HE BEGAN DOCTORS WARNED THAT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS STARTING TO TOOK PRETTY GOOD HE STILL FACED A VERY UNCERTAIN ROAD BACK FROM THE EFFECTS OF SUCH A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY 
DAY EIGHT CRAIG WAS WELL ENOUGH TO TALK TO HIS PARENTS AND HIS UNCLE 
CAN YOU TELL YOUR DADDY DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED 
I WAS IN THE BASEMENT 
I WAS SWINGING ON THE POLE AND I FELL AND HIT MY HEAD 
CRAIG IS QUITE WELL WITH US YET HE'S NOT NORMAL BY ANY MEANS AT THIS POINT 
CRAIG'S THINKING IS NOT NORMAL 
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER AS WELL 
AND JUST WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR SO HAS HE BEGUN TO REMEMBER FROM DAY TO DAY 
HIS ABILITY TO LEARN HIS ABILITY TO INTERACT SOCIALLY WITH HIS FRIENDS WITH HIS PARENTS IS NOT NORMAL YET 
CAN YOU SWING AROUND HERE 
DAY TWELVE CRAIG SEEMS TO HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS 
HE IS TALKING AND MOVING AROUND 
HIS THINKING MEMORY AND PHYSICAL SKILLS ARE IMPROVING 
HIS PARENTS SAY HE IS PRACTICALLY BACK TO NORMAL 
BUT THE REHABILITATION SPECIALIST CAN SEE THAT CRAIG STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS 
OKAY WALK THE SAME SPEED AS ME 
CRAIG'S PARENTS SAY HE WAS VERY ATHLETIC 
IN SUMMER CAMP HE WOULD ALWAYS WIN THE RACES AND HE COULD BY AGE FOUR 
FIRST REHABILITATION SPECIALIST AND GO FORWARD ON THE BALANCE BEAM 
BUT THIS BOY WHO ALSO EXCELLED AT GYMNASTICS STILL NEEDS ASSISTANCE TO JUST WALK ON THE BALANCE BEAM 
HE OFTEN STUMBLES 
FIRST REHABILITATION SPECIALIST 
GREAT 
OKAY PUT YOUR RIGHT FOOT 
AND WHEN ASKED TO HOP ON ONE FOOT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE INJURY AFFECTED ONE SIDE MORE THAN THE OTHER 
OKAY 
NOW TRY TO HOP THREE TIMES IN A ROW 
ONE TWO THREE 
GOOD GOOD JOB 
NOW TRY IT WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT 
I THINK WE CAN SEE CRAIG WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER ALL THIS STUFF DO THE JUMPING TOGETHER AND THE HOPPING IT GETS A LOT HARDER TO DO IT ALL TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME AND DO IT RIGHT 
BUT WE'RE REAL GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING BETTER 
HIS MENTAL DEFICITS ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN SIMPLE EVERYDAY TASKS 
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ASKED TO WASH HIS HANDS HE HAS TROUBLE WITH THE SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS 
HE THE TOWEL FIRST 
NO I DON'T THINK WE DO THAT 
NO LET'S TRY AGAIN 
YOU NEED TO RIGHT 
DO YOU NEED SOME SOAP 
NONE OF THIS SURPRISES THE DOCTORS 
IT IS TYPICAL FOR SERIOUS HEAD INJURY PATIENTS TO HAVE A LONG PERIOD OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DEFICIENCY THOUGH THE YOUNGER THE PATIENT USUALLY THE QUICKER THE RECOVERY 
RIGHT NOW CRAIG IS PROBABLY FUNCTIONING AT ABOUT ONE YEAR LESS THAN HIS CHRONOLOGICAL AGE IN TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO REMEMBER TO THINK TO REASON 
AND DOCTOR ADAIR SAYS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS FOR CHILDREN WITH HEAD INJURIES IS THAT THEY LOOK NORMAL BUT THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT 
THEREFORE UNDERSTANDING IS CRITICAL 
WHEN EVERYBODY AROUND HIM SAYS CRAIG YOU LOOK SO WONDERFUL YOU LOOK SO GREAT YOU LOOK NORMAL AND CRAIG KNOWS HE'S NOT HE'LL BE PUT IN A POSITION OF SOMETIMES FEELING LIKE HE HAS TO DEFEND THAT HE'S NOT OKAY WHICH IS A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT POSITION FOR A CHILD TO BE MUCH LESS AN ADULT 
DAY FIFTEEN CRAIG LEAVES CHRIST HOSPITAL 
HE HAD ENTERED IN A COMA POSSIBLY CLOSE TO DEATH BUT NOW BECAUSE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE SOME HE SAW SOME HE DIDN'T A FAMILY'S PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED 
OH WHAT A MIRACLE OR SO IT SEEMS 
HOW WILL CRAIG DO 
WILL HE MAKE A FULL RECOVERY 
HE'S ALREADY MADE A FULL RECOVERY PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HE'S MAKING IMPROVEMENTS 
HE RETURNED TO SCHOOL THIS WEEK PART TIME BUT THAT WILL TAKE A WHILE LONGER 
IT'S HARD TO SAY 
TIM YOU WERE AN ACTIVE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN WEREN'T YOU IN THE SEVENTIES 
RIGHT 
HOW DIFFERENT IS IT 
WELL THE BIG DIFFERENCE AS WE SEE IN THIS PIECE FROM WHAT WE HAD BACK IN THE SEVENTIES IS THE READY AVAILABILITY OF THE CAT SCAN TO GET A PICTURE OF THE BRAIN WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES SO YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND WHETHER SURGERY IS NEEDED 
I THINK THAT'S THE HUGE DIFFERENCE TODAY 
THIS CHILD MIGHT HAVE DIED 
COULD HAVE OR CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HANDLED AS WELL 
THAT'S A WONDERFUL TOOL 
WE CRITICIZE THE CAT SCAN A LOT BUT IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM HERE IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL 
AND TO SEE IT STEP BY STEP AS WE DID BECAUSE OUR CAMERAS WERE THERE FASCINATING 
THANK YOU 
YOU'RE WELCOME 
WELL NEXT SHE PREACHES TO THE RICH AND FAMOUS AND THE DOWN AND OUT 
AND IF SHE'S NOT SAYING ANYTHING NEW THEN WHY ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LISTENING TO MARIANNE WILLIAMSON
