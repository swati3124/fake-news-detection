THE FIRE SEASON IS JUST BEGINNING IN THE WESTERN U. S. ALREADY FIRE CREWS ARE IN A PITCHED BATTLE AGAINST NATURE 
A WILD FIRE IN WASHINGTON STATE IS BEARING DOWN ON A RESORT COMMUNITY 
RUSTY DORNIN JOINS US NOW LIVE WITH THE LATEST 
RUSTY 
WELL JOE JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO SEVERAL CREWS CAME RUNNING OUT AND JUMPED ON THE TRUCKS 
THERE ARE FIVE APPARENTLY STRIKE FORCES HERE THAT ARE HEADING OUT FOR SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE PROTECTION NEAR LEAVENWORTH 
YOU CAN'T TELL BUT SURROUNDING US IN THIS HUGE FIRE CAMP NEAR LEAVENWORTH ARE MOUNTAINS 
AND THOSE MOUNTAINS THERE ARE SEVERAL FIRES BURNING IN THESE MOUNTAINS ALL AROUND US 
YOU CAN'T SEE IT BECAUSE THE SMOKE IS SO THICK IT BLANKETS THE ENTIRE REGION OF NORTH CENTRAL WASHINGTON 
IT STRETCHES FOR MILES 
NOW COMBINED WITH THE FIRE AND LEAVENWORTH OVER ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND ACRES HAVE BURNED SO FAR 
BUT TROUBLE SPOTS KEEP SHIFTING LIKE THE WIND AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEKEND 
THE BLAZE NEAR LEAVENWORTH WASHINGTON TOOK OFF LIKE A FLASH OVER THE WEEKEND MORE THAN DOUBLING IN SIZE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
IN SOME SPOTS FIREFIGHTERS SAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPTION 
I THINK IT JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN EXPLODED AND THERE WASN'T MUCH YOU COULD DO EXCEPT FOR RUN 
THIS HOUSE SURVIVED A NEAR FIRESTORM WHEN THE BLAZE ROARED THROUGH THE VALLEY AND JUMPED A HIGHWAY 
AWESOME 
IT WAS AWESOME 
THE WINDS THAT THE FIRE CREATED TO KEEP ITSELF GOING WAS JUST UNREAL 
I WAS SCARED VERY SCARED 
WIND WHIPPED BLAZES NEAR HERE HAVE CREWS CHASING THE FIRE IN HEAVILY AREAS FILLED WITH HOMES 
WE'RE CANYON AGAIN SIR WE'RE BACK UP TO LEVEL TWO 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT QUICK BUT WE NEED TO GO IN AND CHECK ON A FEW THINGS AND WE'LL GET IN AND GET OUT 
HAULING WHATEVER THEY COULD FIT IN THE CAR HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS CONTINUED TO EVACUATE NEVER KNOWING WHAT THEY WOULD COME BACK TO IF ANYTHING 
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE EFFORTS THAT'S BEING MADE 
REALLY PLEASED WITH THE EFFORT THAT EVERYBODY'S MAKING 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO YOU KNOW IT'S IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HANDS NOT OURS 
MOST OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS TOWN OF FIVE THOUSAND HAVE SHUT THEIR DOORS 
THE TOURISTS HAVE GONE HOME AND THE RESIDENTS CAN ONLY WATCH AND WAIT 
FORTY MILES AWAY FIREFIGHTERS STEERED THE HUGE BLAZE THAT HAS ALREADY CONSUMED MORE THAN NINETY THOUSAND ACRES AWAY FROM THE RESORT TOWN OF 
WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST NEAR LEAVENWORTH THE LAST COUNT WAS FOURTEEN BUT CREWS CAN'T GET BACK IN TO MANY OF THESE HOT SPOTS AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
WE DO KNOW THAT THIS MORNING THERE WERE FIRE CREWS UP USING EXPLOSIVES TO BLAST FIRE LINES 
AND ALSO NOW ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S SO SMOKY HERE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE'S NO WIND TO BLOW OUT ANY OF THE SMOKE 
ALSO THE TEMPERATURE HAS DROPPED QUITE A BIT MAYBE TWENTY DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON 
NOW THAT'S GOOD NEWS 
THE HUMIDITY SEEMS TO BE RISING AS WELL 
IF THIS WEATHER CAN HOLD I THINK THE FIREFIGHTERS HOPEFULLY MAYBE CAN GET A HANDLE ON THIS FIRE 
REPORTING LIVE FROM LEAVENWORTH WASHINGTON RUSTY DORNIN 
RUSTY YOU MENTIONED THE HOMES LOST WHAT ABOUT THE FRUIT INDUSTRY WHICH IN PARTICULAR THE APPLE AND PEAR ORCHARDS THAT PROVIDE THE BACKBONE OF THAT AREA 
HOW HAS IT FARED 
WELL JOE THIS AREA IS COVERED WITH APPLE AND PEAR ORCHARDS THAT HAVE FRUIT ON THEM 
THEY'RE BEING HEAVILY THEY'RE FULL OF WATER IT'S BEEN A LIFE FOR MANY OF THESE REGIONS BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRES COME DOWN THE ORCHARDS WILL ACT AS A BARRIER AND ACTUALLY HALT THE ADVANCE OF THE FIRE 
IT MAY COME IN ONE ROW MAYBE TWO ROWS BUT NO FARTHER 
SO IN MANY WAYS THE APPLE ORCHARDS ARE NOT ONLY AN ECONOMIC LIFE BUT A LIFE FOR PROPERTY AS WELL
