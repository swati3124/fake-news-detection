THE SHOW IS OVER AND ITS TIME FOR THE ANALYSIS TO BEGIN 
ASTRONOMERS WILL BE STUDYING THOUSANDS OF IMAGES OF THE COMET BOMBARDMENT OF JUPITER 
SCIENTISTS HAVE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF PHOTOS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD NOT TO MENTION AMATEUR PICTURES 
C. N. N.'S MILES O'BRIEN REPORTS 
THIS IS NOT THE DARKEST 
BIGGEST DARK REGION ON JUPITER 
IMAGE BY IMAGE THE SCREENS IN THE CONTROL ROOM FOR THE HUBBELL SPACE TELESCOPE HAVE BECOME WINDOWS TO A DISTANT DISASTER 
FOR ASTRONOMERS LIKE JOHN CLARK IT IS COMPELLING VIEWING 
YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT ON THE NEXT IMAGE 
IT'S VERY EXCITING IT'S IT'S RIVETING 
THIS WAS THE SCENE IN THIS ROOM A WEEK AGO WHEN THE FIRST IMAGE OF A BRUISED AND BATTERED JUPITER FILLED THE COMPUTER SCREENS HERE AT THE SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE 
TODAY THAT CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE IS A CHERISHED MEMENTO IN ASTRONOMER MELISSA OFFICE 
ONCE THE FIRST IMPACT WAS OVER AND WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A SPECTACULAR EVENT AND SO WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO SEE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM THEN WE GOT SERIOUS 
DID THEY EVER 
WORKING FRANTICALLY AROUND THE CLOCK ASTRONOMERS HERE PULLED DOWN NO LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED IMAGES OF THE TURBULENT TRAIL OF THE KAMIKAZE COMET SHOEMAKER LEVY NINE THE LATEST SHOWING TIME ANIMATION OF THE HUGE MUSHROOM CLOUDS AND THE WIND DRIVEN MOVEMENT OF MATERIAL FROM THE IMPACT ZONES 
I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER A COHERENT STORY ABOUT WHAT IT WAS THAT HAPPENED ON JUPITER THIS PAST WEEK 
DAZZLING IMAGES FROM GROUND BASED ARE OFFERING THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL PIECES TO THE COMPLEX PUZZLE 
EVEN AMATEUR ASTRONOMERS RECORDED THE DARK COMET STORM ON JUPITER 
ASTRONOMERS SAY THEIR COMPUTERS ARE SWOLLEN WITH IMAGES AND ELECTRONIC MAIL FROM COLLEAGUES OFFERING NEW THEORIES 
IT'S SORT OF LIKE A TIDAL WAVE THAT'S OVERWHELMED US ALL AND WE'RE SORT OF TUMBLING THROUGH LOOKING AT BITS AND PIECES 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE BEFORE WE LOOK AT IT ALL 
BY THE END OF AUGUST NEW IMAGES OF JUPITER WILL STOP FILLING THE SCREENS HERE AT THE HUBBELL CONTROL ROOM 
THE PLANET WILL HAVE MOVED TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN FOR VIEWING BY THE SPACE TELESCOPE 
ASTRONOMERS WON'T GET ANOTHER LOOK UNTIL JANUARY 
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK FROM JUPITER AND REJOIN THE REAL WORLD FOR A WHILE 
SURE COMET CO DAVID LEVY AND GENE AND CAROLYN SHOEMAKER WILL WATCH WHAT HAPPENS ON JUPITER WITH INTEREST 
BUT NOW THAT THEIR STRING OF PEARLS BABY HAS GONE OUT WITH SEVERAL IT'S TIME AGAIN TO SCAN THE HEAVENS 
IF THE SOLAR SYSTEM HAS THAT SORT OF SURPRISE FOR US WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NEXT ONE WILL BE AND I HOPE TO BE IN ON THAT TOO 
SO BACK TO THE TELESCOPE THEY WILL GO MEMORIES OF THE WEEK WE ALL BECAME STRUCK BY A COMET
