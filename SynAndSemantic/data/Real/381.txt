THERE'S A NEW ART EXHIBIT IN NEW YORK CITY THAT YOU WON'T FIND INDOORS 
IT'S ART THAT WILL ONE DAY BE EATEN AND CAN BE ONLY PROPERLY SEEN FROM THE AIR 
THE STORY FROM C. N. N.'S JEANNE MOOS 
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE SPROUTING ON A ONE ACRE LOT ON MANHATTAN'S WEST SIDE 
PEOPLE IN OVERLOOKING THE SITE WERE LEFT HANGING 
WE ALL PUZZLED HERE HAVING OUR ON THE PORCH THINKING WHAT COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE 
AFTER ALL NEW YORKERS DON'T FARM 
WHY IN NEW YORK THE WORD HOE IS SLANG FOR PROSTITUTE 
I THINK I'LL CREATE A LITTLE BIT 
STAN HERD SPECIALIZES IN CROP ART 
YOU USUALLY SEE HIS CREATIONS OUT IN THE ROLLING FIELDS OF THE MIDWEST OR IN HIS BOOK 
WELL NOW THIS KANSAS BOY HAS COME TO MANHATTAN 
HERD CONVINCED DONALD TRUMP TO LOAN HIM A LOT AND THIS SUMMER HE'S BEEN PLANTING CROPS THAT TEND TO GROW ON YOU 
THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN HAUNTING ME AND I JUST HAD TO GET IT ON THE GROUND SOMEPLACE 
IT IS SLOWLY COMING ALONG THOUGH AT FIRST INSTEAD OF TREE GINNY THOUGHT SHE WAS LOOKING AT A MAP OF THE WORLD 
WE SORT OF THOUGHT IT WAS ITALY 
WE THOUGHT THAT PART OF THE TREE WAS ITALY 
THE IMAGE CONSISTS MOSTLY OF SQUASH AND WATERMELON AND SOYBEANS 
THERE ARE WOOD CHIPS WORKED IN AS WELL AS MARBLE CHIPS 
HERD HAS A FULL TIME ASSISTANT WORKING ON THE PIECE AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF HOMELESS MEN WHO LIVE NEARBY 
THIS GUY CALLS HIMSELF LONE WOLF 
I COME EVERYDAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THESE PLANTS NEED ATTENTION 
THIS IS REALLY THIS IS ONE BIG GARDEN 
THE TRICKIEST PART IS CHECKING YOUR WORK 
AFTER ALL YOU CAN'T JUST STEP BACK 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT REACHES THIS STAGE I LIKE TO SEE IT FROM STRAIGHT UP 
THAT MEANS A RIDE IN A HELICOPTER 
KEEPS YOUR EYES PEELED THE NEXT TIME YOU FLY OVER MANHATTAN FOR A BIRD'S EYE VIEW 
HERD IS KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR NEW YORK WILDLIFE 
RATS 
I DON'T KNOW 
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT THEY'LL COME AND EAT THAT STUFF 
THE FIELD STARTED LIKE THIS 
A MONTH OR SO LATER IT LOOKS LIKE THIS 
HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION CREWS WORKING NEARBY GIVE HERD ADVICE AND TEASE THE COUNTRY BOY 
I WANT TO KNOW IF HE'S CLICKING HIS HEELS TO GET BACK TO KANSAS 
AND EVEN BALCONY OBSERVERS OFFER THEIR ADVICE 
WHY NOT HAVE ALL FLOWERS 
EVERY MOVE IS SCRUTINIZED 
HE'S NOT AS GOOD AT THE LITTLE THING 
THIS ONE ACRE PIECE IS SMALLEST WORK 
OUT IN THE MIDWEST THEY GROW AS BIG AS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ACRES 
SO HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE FIELD ALTERED OR VANDALIZED OR CHANGED IN ANY WAY 
I HAVEN'T HAD THAT HAPPEN YET TO MY KNOWLEDGE 
WANNA BET
