THIS IS KATIE DAVIS 
COMING UP ON ALL THINGS CONSIDERED MANY AMERICANS ARE GETTING NEW JOBS BUT THEY'RE ONLY TEMPORARY 
SOME SAY THAT HURTS MORALE 
TAPPING FOR RUBBER IN THE AMAZON IT STILL GOES ON BUT THERE ARE FEWER BUYERS NOW 
AND THE POET GIVES A VOICE TO THE OLD GODS OF MEXICO 
THAT'S COMING UP SO STAY TUNED 
A GROWING NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS ARE FINDING THEY CAN RUN THEIR COMPANIES JUST AS EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYEES FULL TIME EMPLOYEES THAT IS 
THESE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE TURNING TO EMPLOYEE LEASING FIRMS OUTSIDE COMPANIES THAT TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING FROM PAYROLL CHECKS TO THE COMPANY PICNIC 
LEASING COMPANIES TOUT THE BENEFITS OF THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT FOR MANAGERS AND WORKERS ALIKE 
SOME EXPERTS THOUGH ARE WARNING OF PITFALLS FOR BUSINESS OWNERS 
NPR'S ELAINE KORRY REPORTS FROM SAN FRANCISCO 
ONTARIO FOR A DAY OF CAR RENTAL LET'S SEE WHAT DATE WERE WE TALKING ABOUT 
CARRIE OWNS THIS SMALL TRAVEL AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA THIRTY MILES EAST OF SAN FRANCISCO 
LIKE OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SHE HAS THE SATISFACTION OF BEING HER OWN BOSS AND WATCHING HER ENTERPRISE GROW 
BUT AS A SMALL EMPLOYER ALSO HAS HAD HER SHARE OF FRUSTRATIONS 
HER BREAKING POINT CAME ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO ON THE EVE OF A LONG AWAITED VACATION 
I WAS HERE AT OFFICE IT WAS ABOUT FOUR IN THE MORNING AND I WAS WRITING PAYROLL CHECKS 
AND I WAS TRYING TO GUESS HOW MANY HOURS THE EMPLOYEES WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK WHILE I WAS GONE BECAUSE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHILE I WAS GONE 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE INSANE THAT I WAS TRYING TO DO THIS 
WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM VACATION CALLED NATIONAL STAFF NETWORK AN EMPLOYEE LEASING COMPANY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
CARRIE EFFECTIVELY FIRED ALL HER EMPLOYEES 
THE SAME DAY THEY WERE HIRED BY THE NETWORK AND ASSIGNED TO CONTINUE WORKING AT THEIR FORMER JOBS 
EMPLOYEE LEASING MEANS CAN CONCENTRATE ON WHAT SHE'S GOOD AT SERVING HER CUSTOMERS RATHER THAN WASTING VALUABLE TIME ON PERSONNEL MATTERS 
IT ELIMINATES PROBABLY TWENTY HOURS A MONTH THAT I'M NOT WORKING ON PAYROLL RECORDS NOT HAVING TO FILE FORMS NOT HAVING TO MAKE PAYROLL TAX DEPOSITS WHICH ALL YOU HAVE TO IS FORGET ONCE YOU'VE GOT PENALTIES YOU'VE GOT EXTRA FORMS TO FILE 
YOU'VE GOT TO RECONCILE EVERYTHING 
IT'S A MAJOR HEADACHE 
SAYS SHE'S PLEASED WITH HER NEW LEASING ARRANGEMENT 
AS FOR HER EMPLOYEES WELL THEY SAY CHANGED EXCEPT THE PAYCHECKS ARE ALWAYS THERE ON TIME 
AND LONGTIME STAFFER LAURIE FORD SAYS SINCE THE EMPLOYEES WENT ON THE NETWORK'S PAYROLL THEY HAVE ACCESS TO BETTER BENEFITS 
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY OFFER AS FAR AS YOU KNOW PROFIT SHARING AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE DENTAL INSURANCE AND LIFE INSURANCE AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE NORMALLY ON A SMALL BUSINESS TYPE BASIS 
EMPLOYEE LEASING COMPANIES SAY THE ARRANGEMENT SUITS EVERYONE 
EMPLOYEES HAVE GREATER JOB SECURITY AND MORE CHOICE ABOUT BENEFITS 
AND FOR A FEE TO THE COMPANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN ESCAPE THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS PAPERWORK 
AS THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD THE LEASING COMPANY ASSUMES THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF MANAGING THE WORK FORCE 
AND THAT INCLUDES ANOTHER FOR BUSINESS OWNERS THE PROMISE OF LEGAL PROTECTION 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE AN EMPLOYER WITH ALL THE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT LAWSUITS 
I MEAN WE SAY THERE'S TWO KINDS OF EMPLOYERS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN SUED AND THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO BE SUED 
ERIC IS THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR NATIONAL STAFF NETWORK WHICH PROVIDES EMPLOYEES IN SOME TWENTY SIX STATES 
HE'S SAYS WHEN CLIENTS BUY THE NETWORK SERVICES THEY CAN STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE SMALL EMPLOYER'S GREATEST FEAR AN EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING LAWSUIT 
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A CASE IN MICHIGAN WHERE THE EMPLOYEE FELT THEY HAD BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND THEY IMMEDIATELY NAMED THE CLIENT AS THE DEFENDANT 
WE MOVED IN AND THE AGENCY TO REMOVE THE CLIENT AS THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE WE WERE THE LEGAL EMPLOYER 
AND IF THERE WAS ANY DISCRIMINATION WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LEGALLY LIABLE 
EMPLOYEE LEASING MAY SEEM LIKE A PERFECT SOLUTION FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS 
BUT RICHARD BELLOWS A LABOR ECONOMIST IN WASHINGTON FEARS WHAT THE RAPID GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY WILL MEAN ESPECIALLY FOR WORKERS 
THERE ARE MANY EMPLOYEE LEASING FIRMS OUT THERE WHICH ARE HONEST AND UPHOLD THE LETTER OF THE LAW 
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ALSO OUT THERE ENGAGED IN EMPLOYEE LEASING WHICH HAVE BEEN HIGHLY FRAUDULENT HAVE SAID THEY'RE PAYING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS WHEN THEY'RE NOT AND HAVE VIOLATED OTHER FORMS OF OUR LABOR LAWS 
BELLOWS SAYS EVEN LEGITIMATE LEASING COMPANIES POSE A THREAT TO THE WORK FORCE 
HE'S BEEN STUDYING GROWING RELIANCE ON SO CALLED CONTINGENT WORKERS PART TIMERS TEMPORARIES 
BELLOWS VIEWS EMPLOYEE LEASING AS ONE MORE STRATEGY TO CUT COSTS AND BOOST EFFICIENCY AT THE EXPENSE OF EMPLOYEES 
ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS BEHIND EMPLOYEE LEASING IS BECAUSE YOU IS THE DESIRE OF EMPLOYERS TO SEGMENT THEIR WORK FORCE TO PERHAPS GIVE ONE LEVEL OF BENEFITS TO CERTAIN WORKERS AND LESS BENEFITS TO OTHER WORKERS OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF BENEFITS 
ALTHOUGH LEASING CAN SAVE SOME EMPLOYERS TIME AND MONEY THE ARRANGEMENT MAY ALSO BRING HIDDEN COSTS 
EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES RESENT BEING FIRED AND THEN REHIRED BY AN OUTSIDE COMPANY OFTEN WITH HEADQUARTERS IN ANOTHER STATE 
ATTORNEY MARVIN GOLDSTEIN WHO REPRESENTS BUSINESS OWNERS SAYS WHEN THE OLD EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP IS GONE WORK FORCE MORALE CAN SUFFER 
LOYALTY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE PAST IS OFTEN EVAPORATED 
ARGUABLY YOU WILL LOSE THE DEDICATION OF THESE EMPLOYEES 
QUESTIONS OF POOR QUALITY COME INTO PLAY 
THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF POTENTIAL 
GOLDSTEIN ADVISES HIS CLIENTS TO WEIGH THE BEFORE THEY LEASE EMPLOYEES 
HE SAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT LEGAL LIABILITY IN THE WORKPLACE ARE FAR FROM SETTLED 
AND ACCORDING TO GOLDSTEIN BUSINESS OWNERS WHO THINK THEY CAN AVOID THE PERILS OF BEING AN EMPLOYER ARE JUST BEING NAIVE
