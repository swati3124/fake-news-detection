THANKS FOR JOINING US 
BERNARD SHAW IS OFF TODAY 
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON WAS ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY TELLING LAW MAKERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S HEALTH CARE REFORM PLAN 
SHE'S PROVEN SHE CAN FIELD MORE THAT SOFT BALL QUESTIONS BUT DID SHE HIT ANY HOME RUNS 
C. N. N.'S BOB FRANKEN HAS BEEN COVERING HER CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY ALL DAY 
HE JOINS US NOW FROM CAPITOL HILL 
BOB 
WELL JUDY FIRST OF ALL I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT MRS. CLINTON HAS ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS UP HERE WITH HER HUGE GRASP OF THE DETAILS 
IT WAS THAT WAY TODAY 
THERE WAS NOBODY SITTING AT HER TABLE NOBODY HANDING HER NOTES 
BUT AS FOR THE QUESTIONS THEY WERE AS YOU DESCRIBED THEM FOR THE MOST PART SOFT BALL QUESTIONS 
NOW YOU MENTIONED PERSONAL REFERENCE AND MY REFERENCE IS MY MOM 
WHAT CAN YOU ADD TO REASSURE MOTHER 
WELL LET ME START I HAVE A MOTHER TOO MR. STARK SO IF WE CAN'T PASS THE MOTHER TEST WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCEED ARE WE 
WE'RE IN TROUBLE 
WE CAN REDUCE THE RATE OF INCREASE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WITHOUT IN ANY WAY UNDERMINING QUALITY 
NOW IF ALL WE WERE TO DO THOUGH IS TO SAY GO OUT AND REDUCE IT WITHOUT ON THE PRIVATE SIDE TRYING TO MAKE SOME OF THESE CHARGES WHICH THE MEDICARE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INITIATE AND TO REWARD 
I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE TELLING MY MOTHER THAT THE KIND OF CARE THAT I WANT HER TO HAVE CAN BE DELIVERED IN A COST EFFECTIVE HIGH QUALITY WAY AND THERE ARE MANY PLACES AROUND THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE DOING A BETTER JOB 
CAN YOU JOIN ME TODAY IN PROMISING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT NO NEW BENEFITS WILL BE ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED UNTIL AFTER REAL AND SUFFICIENT SAVINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED 
WE THINK MR. THOMAS THE SAVINGS GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE BENEFITS 
UNDER THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN THE REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF INCREASE IN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WOULD BE USED IN PART TO FUND NEW BENEFITS NAMELY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR THE ELDERLY AND A BEGINNING ON A LONG TERM CARE PROPOSAL 
THEY GO HAND IN HAND 
ONE DOESN'T PRECEDE OR FOLLOWING THE OTHER 
IF REVENUES FROM TAXING CIGARETTES DECLINE DO YOU THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD CONSIDER TAKING OTHER LIKE SUBSTANCES LIKE CAFFEINE CHOLESTEROL SALT SUGAR ALCOHOL AND PUTTING A TAX ON THOSE LIKE SUBSTANCES 
WELL MR. FIRST OF ALL THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH IN THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN 
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE FREE EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE PAYING SOMETHING 
EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICAID NOW WILL BE PAYING SOMETHING IF THEY WORK UNLIKE TODAY 
IF THERE IS WAY THAT YOU CAN EVER COME UP WITH TAX SUBSTANCES LIKE THE ONES YOU'VE JUST NAMED WE'LL BE GLAD TO LOOK AT IT 
I'VE NOT SEEN ANY THAT WOULD BE REALISTICALLY IMPLEMENTED 
MY COMPLIMENTS TO YOU MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM AND I HOPE THAT BY THE END OF THIS CONGRESS IT WILL BE ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK YOU STANDING AT HIS SIDE FOR SIGNATURE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US MRS. CLINTON 
THE REACTION OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE THIS MORNING FOR MRS. CLINTON BORDERED ON ECSTASY 
IT WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE RESERVED THIS AFTERNOON WHEN SHE TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE 
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BE INSURED OR WHO GET GOOD RATES FOR INSURANCE ARE YOUNG PREDOMINANTLY SINGLE HEALTHY AMERICANS AND THEY RIGHT NOW ARE EITHER PAYING LESS THAN THE REST OF US BECAUSE THEY ARE YOUNG AND HEALTHY OR ARE CHOOSING NOT TO BE INSURED 
THEY ARE AMONG THE CATEGORIES OF AMERICANS AND WE ESTIMATE THIS IS ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE PERCENT OF AMERICANS WHO WILL PAY MORE FOR ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF BENEFITS 
MRS. CLINTON TOMORROW MOVES OVER TO THE SENATE SIDE WHERE SHE STARTS THE DAY TESTIFYING BEFORE THE SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY 
I THINK IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT JUDY TO SAY THAT SO FAR SO GOOD FOR MRS. CLINTON 
THANKS BOB 
TOMORROW I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT SITTING ON THE TABLE WITH HER
