AFTER LEAVING PHILADELPHIA THE PRESIDENT WAS ON HIS WAY TO IOWA TO SURVEY THE FLOOD DAMAGE THERE ALONG THE SWOLLEN MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
ALL WEEK LONG THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN FORCED FROM THEIR HOMES BY THE WORST FLOODING IN THE UPPER MIDWEST IN NEARLY THIRTY YEARS 
DESPITE PREDICTIONS THE WORST WAS OVER THE MISSISSIPPI TODAY WAS CRESTING IN RIVERSIDE CITIES AND TOWNS FROM MINNESOTA TO MISSOURI 
A. B. C.'S KATHY WOLFF REPORTS 
BUFFALO IOWA POPULATION ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
ONE THIRD OF THE HOMES ARE IN WATER AS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER HIT A CREST TODAY AT A NEAR RECORD OF TWENTY TWO FEET 
BUT PEOPLE HERE ARE CELEBRATING THE FOURTH OF JULY WITH FAITH 
SOME MEMBERS OF THIS QUAKER CHURCH LOST THEIR HOMES TO THE FLOOD BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE IT IN STRIDE 
GLEN AND GINA MILLER WON'T SLEEP IN THEIR HOUSE AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME 
WE WERE IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY AND THERE WAS TWENTY TWO AND ONE HALF INCHES OF WATER IN THE FROM THE FLOOR TO THE TOP OF THE WATER YESTERDAY 
THAT WAS PRETTY DEPRESSING 
WE DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET WATER IN THE UPSTAIRS 
BUT IT HAPPENED AND I GUESS THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU LIVE ALONG THE RIVER 
THE CAN'T EVEN REACH THEIR HOME NOW 
THEY CAN ONLY SEE IT FROM A DISTANCE 
THEY'RE HAVING A QUIET HOLIDAY IN TEMPORARY HOUSING 
AT BUFFALO CITY HALL FOOD WAS BEING SERVED TODAY TO VOLUNTEERS AND ANYONE WHO NEEDED A MEAL 
NORMALLY THE WHOLE TOWN WOULD BE ANTICIPATING THE FIREWORKS ON THE RIVER BUT TO SOME THE SPIRIT OF HELPING FRIENDS BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE COUNTRY 
YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO HAVE THE FIREWORKS AND STUFF BUT THAT'S JUST TRAPPINGS 
WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT 
THIS IS THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WORKING WITH PEOPLE 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
AND THERE IS LOTS MORE WORK TO DO 
IT WILL BE TWO TO THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE WATER RECEDES 
AND EVEN THOUGH THE RIVER IS HITTING ITS HIGH WATER MARK NOW THE WEATHER SERVICE WARNS THE PROCESS COULD BE PROLONGED BY MORE RAIN
