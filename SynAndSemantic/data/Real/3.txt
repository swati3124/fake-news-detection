TODAY IS MAY DAY 
FOR DECADES ON THIS DAY RED SQUARE WAS FILLED WITH BANNERS FLAGS MILITARY HARDWARE A LINEUP OF COMMUNIST LEADERS AND THE COMMUNIST WORKING MASSES 
NOT ANY MORE 
HERE'S C. N. N.'S EILEEN O'CONNOR 
NO IT ISN'T MARX AND LENIN THIS MAY DAY IT WAS KING MOUSE AND GRANDMA RED SQUARE CELEBRATING SPRING 
FORGETTING ALL THE WORK AHEAD ON WHAT WAS WORKER'S DAY 
GONE WERE THE REGIMENTAL DANCING THE REQUISITE CHANTING 
IT'S NOW BASICALLY A CELEBRATION SAYS THE DOG 
IN THE PAST WE DRANK 
NOW WE HAVE FUN KING MOUSE ADDS 
LIFE'S A LITTLE TENSE SAYS GRANNY BUT WE BELIEVE EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY 
THAT IS NOT A VIEW SHARED BY ALL 
WHAT'S THERE TO CELEBRATE SAY MANY OF THESE COMMUNISTS CRITICIZING THE YELTSIN GOVERNMENT 
THEY RIDICULED THE ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD AROUND RED SQUARE TO BANK ROLL THE FESTIVITIES 
WHEN AM I EVER GOING TO GO THE CANARY ISLANDS OLGA 
IT'S A MOCKERY TO OUR POOR PEOPLE 
FREEDOM FOR HER SAYS WE'RE JUST GETTING RIPPED OFF 
CLEARLY THE BIG RED SQUARE SELL OFF WAS NOT A HUGE SUCCESS 
EVEN WESTERN BUSINESSES COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ONE DAY OFFER OF USING THE FORMER SEED OF COMMUNISM AS ONE BIG CAPITALIST BILLBOARD A MADISON AVENUE DREAM BUT A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE FEW AD AGENCIES COULD OVERCOME IN TIME 
STILL IT DIDN'T MATTER AS PEOPLE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ANY EXCUSE TO FORGET THE DAY TO DAY AND TANGO WITH THE TUBA
