THE SUMMER IN THE U. S. IS MAKING LIFE MISERABLE THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY 
CORRESPONDENT DEBORAH POTTER HAS MORE FROM WASHINGTON 
FROM THE NATION'S CAPITOL UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST IT WAS HARD TO FIND ANYONE WHO WASN'T HOT 
ADD IN THE HUMIDITY AND YOU'RE TALKING MISERY 
THE WEATHER SERVICE CALLS IT THE HEAT INDEX 
WE'RE TRYING TO DEFINE WITH AN APPARENT TEMPERATURE IF YOU WILL THE TEMPERATURE YOUR BODY FEELS IT IS 
AT MID DAY IN WASHINGTON THE INDEX HIT ONE HUNDRED SEVEN HIGH ENOUGH TO BE A HEALTH RISK ESPECIALLY FOR THE ELDERLY 
IT MEANS STAY INSIDE PREFERABLY IN AN AIR CONDITIONED SPACE AVOID ANY STRENUOUS EXERCISE OUTSIDE AND TO DRINK PLENTY OF FLUID 
IN NEW YORK SOME ELDERLY RESIDENTS TOOK THE ADVICE AND CROWDED INTO A SENIOR CENTER 
FOR SOME WHO HAD TO WORK STAYING COOL WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 
BUT AT THE MIDWEST ICE COMPANY IN DETROIT THE COOLEST PLACE TO BE WAS ON THE JOB 
I WAS SWEATIN' LIKE A DOG BEFORE I CAME IN AND YOU KNOW WE AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' BUT FANS AT HOME SO I'M GLAD TO BE UP IN HERE NOW 
I'M COOL VERY COOL WHILE Y'ALL OUT THERE SWEATIN' I'M IN HERE OUT REAL NICE 
OUTSIDE THE ANSWER SEEMED TO BE WATER GET NEAR IT OR IN IT OR GET IT IN YOU 
ICE CREAM TODAY 'CAUSE IT'S EVERYWHERE SO NO ONE WANTS TO BUY IT 
IS THERE ANY RELIEF IN SIGHT 
THE MAPS SAY NO 
WE'VE HAD A STAGNANT WEATHER SITUATION 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE AIR MOTION OUTSIDE SO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES AND THE EASTERN SEABOARD ARE IN FOR A HEAT WAVE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT WEEK 
SOME AT LEAST AREN'T BY THE FORECAST 
HEAT AND COLD AFFECTS THE BODY BUT THE SOUL IS UNAFFECTED BY THESE THINGS 
SO THAT'S WHY WE COME OUT EITHER WAY
