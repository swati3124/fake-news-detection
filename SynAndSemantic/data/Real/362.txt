THE LURE OF QUICK MONEY DRAWS MILLIONS OF TOURISTS TO LAS VEGAS BUT IT ALSO DRAWS THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT INCLUDING ROBBERS WHO PREY ON CASINOS 
NOW POLICE HAVE A NEW WEAPON IN THEIR WAR AGAINST THE CASINO BANDITS 
THE STORY FROM C. N. N.'S ROBERT VITO 
THIS TAKE OVER ROBBERY MAY LOOK REAL BUT IT'S NOT 
IT IS A SEGMENT OF A JUST COMPLETED POLICE TRAINING TAPE IN WHICH ALL THE ACTORS ARE COPS 
THIS TAKE OVER ROBBERY OF A LAS VEGAS ROBBERY IS THE REAL THING 
IT'S ONE OF EIGHT CASINO IN THE CITY IN THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ROBBERIES LIKE THIS WERE MORE RARE THAN A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR WINNER 
OFFICIALS WORRY ABOUT VISITORS GETTING HURT OR KILLED DURING A TAKE OVER 
THEY KNOW THAT WOULD DRIVE AWAY TOURISM AND DEVASTATE THE ECONOMY OF THE CITY 
OUR CONCERN IS LET'S STOP IT BEFORE THAT DOES HAPPEN 
A NUMBER OF STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAKE CASINOS MORE ROBBERY PROOF 
INDEED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND CASINO OFFICIALS IN MEETINGS LIKE THIS ARE WORKING HAND IN HAND TO MAKE CASINOS AN PLACE FOR BANDITS 
WATCH FOR THE UNUSUAL AND DO WHAT YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO DO 
WE RODE ALONG THE VEGAS STRIP WITH VETERAN F. B. I. AGENT BURT SMITH 
HE SAYS LOS ANGELES GANGS FIGURE INTO THE CASINO ROBBERY PROBLEM BUT THEY'RE NOT THE TOTAL PROBLEM 
MORE LIKELY IT SEEMS TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR SOMETIMES JUST ONE GUY DECIDES HE NEEDS SOME MONEY HE WANTS IT NOW AND THIS IS WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO 
THREE MEN ACCUSED OF TAKING PART IN THIS LAS VEGAS HAVE BEEN INDICTED ON FEDERAL CHARGES OF INTERFERING WITH COMMERCE BY VIOLENCE 
SMITH SAYS CHARGING THEM WITH FEDERAL CRIMES IS A WAY OF SENDING A MESSAGE TO OTHER WOULD BE CASINO ROBBERS 
DO THE CRIME DO THE TIME AND NO EARLY PAROLE 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUR GUEST FOR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS 
MOST OF THE ROBBERS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THESE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND ARE AWAITING TRIAL 
ESSENTIALLY IT'S OUR PLAN AGAINST THEIRS AND SO FAR OUR PLAN HAS BEEN BETTER 
AND SMITH SAYS THE ODDS ARE GROWING IN FAVOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
