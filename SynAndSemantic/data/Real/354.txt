THE DICTIONARY SEEMS TO BE VERY CLEAR ON THE POINT 
A VIRGIN IS A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE 
SO WHY IS THE SCHOOL BOARD COMMITTEE IN NEW YORK RECOMMENDING THE DEFINITION BE EXPANDED 
YOU WANT ANSWERS YOU ASK C. N. N.'S JEANNE MOOS 
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER VIRGIN TERRITORY WHERE YOU CAN VERGE ON BEING A VIRGIN 
ABSOLUTELY 
THERE'S SECONDARY 
SECONDARY IS A CONCEPT 
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY TRYING TO START THIS SECONDARY VIRGIN THINGS IT AIN'T GONNA BE 
OH IT'S HAPPENING ALL RIGHT IN SCHOOL CURRICULA AIMED AT REACHING KIDS WHO HAVE ALREADY HAD SEX 
THEY WANT TO CALL IT SECONDARY MEANING THAT THEY WANT US TO STOP HAVING SEX IF WE ARE 
IN THESE DAYS OF SAFER SEX AND DANCING CONDOMS SECONDARY IS HARD TO FORGET 
I DON'T KNOW WHO CREATED IT 
I JUST PICKED IT UP FROM THE ABSTINENCE CROWD THAT I MIX WITH 
TO GET KIDS TO ABSTAIN FROM SEX DOCTOR INTRODUCED THE PHRASE SECONDARY TO MEMBERS OF NEW YORK'S BOARD OF EDUCATION H. I. V. SLASH AIDS COUNCIL 
IT'S NOT THAT IT RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY IT'S JUST SILLY AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT 
TERI LEWIS RECENTLY QUIT THE H. I. V. SLASH AIDS COUNCIL IN DISGUST OVER WHAT SHE VIEWED AS ITS CONSERVATIVE TILT 
WHAT'S NEXT AFTER SECONDARY 
LIKE TERTIARY 
THE NEW YORK H. I. V. SLASH AIDS COUNCIL VOTED TO RECOMMEND THAT THE PHRASE SECONDARY BE INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTH CURRICULUM AS IT ALREADY HAS BEEN BY A NUMBER OF OTHER SCHOOLS DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
BUT CAN BE BORN AGAIN 
AFTER ALL WEBSTER'S DEFINES A VIRGIN AS ONE WHO HAS NEVER HAD SEX 
AND HOW ABOUT THIS TERM SECONDARY 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING 
ONCE YOU'RE NOT A VIRGIN THAT'S IT 
STUPID 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN SEW YOURSELF BACK TOGETHER 
DON'T MAKE SENSE 
BUT DOCTOR SAYS THAT'S MISSING THE POINT 
THE POINT IS THAT EVEN AFTER TEENAGERS HAVE STARTED HAVING SEX THEY CAN HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS AND STOP 
THE WORD SECONDARY IS JUST A NICE WAY TO PUT IT 
MAYBE IT WOULD NICE TO FLY SECONDARY VIRGIN AIRWAYS OR VISIT THE SECONDARY VIRGIN ISLANDS OR MEET SECONDARY VIRGINIANS OR HEAR MADONNA SING LIKE A SECONDARY VIRGIN OR MAYBE ALL THAT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU HAVE AN AVERSION TO VIRGINS
