THE REUTERS NEWS SERVICE REPORTS THAT THERE WAS HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND UNITA REBELS IN ANGOLA THIS WEEKEND JUST SIXTY MILES FROM THE CAPITAL LUANDA 
PEACE TALKS ARE UNDERWAY BUT REACHED AN IMPASSE LAST WEEK WHEN THE REBELS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF TRYING TO ASSASSINATE THEIR LEADER JONAS SAVIMBI 
THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WAR RESUMED MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AND AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED OF STARVATION DISEASE AND WAR INJURIES DURING THAT TIME 
CINDY OF AFRICAN NEWS SERVICE RECENTLY VISITED A BESIEGED CITY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AND REPORTS ON THE CHILDREN ORPHANED BY THE ANGOLAN WAR 
THE CITY OF RESTS BETWEEN ROLLING GREEN HILLS IN NORTHERN ANGOLA 
DOWNTOWN AN OUTDOOR MARKET SELLS WHISKEY AND WINE THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON HERE CAN HARDLY AFFORD 
A BARBER SHOP STANDS AS ONE OF THE FEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE REOPENED 
IT'S A STRANGE SIGHT IN A TOWN POPULATED MAINLY BY REFUGEES WHO CAN RARELY AFFORD A MEAL LET ALONE A HAIRCUT 
THE POVERTY IS REFLECTED MOST VIVIDLY IN THE CHILDREN 
THEY WANDER THE STREETS ROOTING THROUGH PILES OF GARBAGE FOR FOOD 
MANY HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED BY MALNUTRITION AND CRAWL ON ALL FOURS 
SOME OF THE LUCKY CHILDREN GET MEALS AT FEEDING CENTERS LIKE THIS ONE RUN BY FOREIGN RELIEF GROUPS 
SEAN LEE WORKS IN WITH THE IRISH BASED AID GROUP CONCERN WHICH RUNS THE FEEDING CENTERS FROM A SEMINARY WAREHOUSE AND SCHOOLS 
WELL A LOT OF THE CASES SEEM TO BE THE CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG CHILDREN THEIR MOTHERS HAVE GONE OUT TO THE COUNTRY TO GET FOOD AND HAVE BEEN EITHER KILLED OR BLOWN UP BY MINES AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE CASES 
RELIEF WORKERS ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE UP TO TEN THOUSAND ORPHANS IN 
LIKE LEE SAYS MANY OF THEIR PARENTS HAVE BEEN KILLED WHEN THEY VENTURE INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE LOOKING FOR A ROOT THAT GROWS WIDELY HERE AND HAS HELPED KEEP MANY PEOPLE ALIVE 
IF ADULTS AREN'T KILLED BY THE LAND MINES THEY RISK BEING SHOT BY UNITA REBELS OR BY GOVERNMENT TROOPS 
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED LEFT BEHIND CHILDREN LIKE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 
HE LIVES AT THE SEMINARY WHICH SERVES AS ONE OF THE LOCAL FEEDING CENTERS 
IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THAT HOUSES HOMELESS CHILDREN 
I WAS ORPHANED BY MY PARENTS 
MY FATHER GOT SICK AND DIED AND MY MOTHER DIED OF AN INJURY 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COME TO THE FEEDING CENTERS EVERY DAY TO RECEIVE RATIONS OF A YELLOW HIGH PROTEIN 
TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MARIA JOSE IS AMONG THEM 
TWO OF HER CHILDREN WERE KILLED BY REBELS OUTSIDE OF 
THE THREE REMAINING TODDLERS WERE ON THE VERGE OF STARVING TO DEATH UNTIL FOOD AID ARRIVED IN SEPTEMBER 
WE LOST EVERYTHING 
WE WERE WITHOUT A HOUSE WITHOUT A PLACE TO STAY 
SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED WHEN THEY ATTACKED AT MIDNIGHT 
MY CHILDREN WEREN'T ABLE TO ESCAPE AND MY HUSBAND WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SOME CHILDREN INJURED IN THE WAR END UP IN HOSPITAL 
A QUICK TOUR REVEALS A AND EMACIATED FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHOSE LEG IS FROM MALNUTRITION 
SHE SHIFTS CONSTANTLY UNDER HER SHEET AND SPEAKS IN HALTING WORDS THROUGH SURGES OF PAIN 
MEDICINE AT THE HOSPITAL IS OFTEN STOLEN AND CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED AT THE DOWNTOWN MARKET 
A GOVERNMENT HEALTH OFFICIAL IN SAYS THREE TO FOUR CHILDREN DIE AT THE HOSPITAL EACH DAY 
ANGOLA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE THE HIGHEST INFANT MORTALITY RATE IN THE WORLD 
IN OCTOBER ALONE SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN DIED OF MALNUTRITION IN 
DOCTOR IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CITY'S HOSPITAL 
THE PROBLEM WITH MALNUTRITION ONLY BEGAN THIS YEAR 
THIS PROVINCE IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AGRICULTURAL AND WE NEVER HAD THIS SITUATION 
THIS BEGAN WHEN THE WAR RESUMED IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR 
THAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE TIME TO USHER DEMOCRACY INTO THIS FORMER COLONY 
ELECTIONS HAD JUST BEEN HELD IN LINE WITH PEACE ACCORDS THAT HAD ENDED SIXTEEN YEARS OF WAR 
BUT UNITA REFUSED TO ACCEPT ITS DEFEAT IN THE ELECTIONS AND FIGHTING ERUPTED AGAIN 
THE WAR SWITCHED FROM RURAL BATTLES TO URBAN CREATING MINI THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
DESPITE A RECENT LULL IN THE FIGHTING IS STILL SURROUNDED BY UNITA 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM SENDS FOOD TO ON TWO FLIGHTS A DAY BUT IT ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST SEVEN FLIGHTS ARE NEEDED DAILY 
THE U. N. RELIEF COORDINATOR IN ANGOLA MANUEL DA SILVA SAYS THE SITUATION IN REFLECTS THE PROBLEMS PLAGUING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY 
HE SAYS THAT THE U. N. HAS RECEIVED LESS THAN HALF OF THE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT ASKED FOR EARLIER THIS YEAR 
OUR APPEAL IN GENEVA GOT TO A MOMENT WHERE THERE WAS OTHER PRIORITIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND BASICALLY BOSNIA AND SOMALIA WERE GETTING ALL THE MASS MEDIA ATTENTION 
THIS IS NOT A VERY POPULAR WAR 
THE WAR ISN'T HIGH PROFILE BUT IT IS PARTICULARLY BLOODY 
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS DESCRIBED THE ANGOLAN WAR AS THE WORLD'S WORST CONFLICT WITH AS MANY AS ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING DAILY 
BUT AN END TO THE WAR MIGHT BE IN SIGHT 
PEACE TALKS BETWEEN UNITA AND THE GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS 
THE TWO SIDES HAVE AGREED ON STEPS TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING A CEASE FIRE 
BUT WITH EIGHTEEN YEARS OF MISTRUST BEHIND THEM OBSERVERS SAY IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE ANGOLA CEASES TO BE A BATTLEFIELD 
BACK IN THE CHILDREN LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET INTO THE FEEDING CENTERS WAIT FOR THE POLITICIANS TO MAKE PEACE 
BUT EVEN WHEN THE WAR DOES END IT WILL BE DECADES BEFORE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO PUT THE ATROCITIES AND LOSSES BEHIND THEM
