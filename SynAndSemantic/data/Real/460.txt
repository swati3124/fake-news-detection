THIS IS ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
I'M NOAH ADAMS 
GENERAL MOTORS AND FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE WORKED OUT A DEAL WHICH A LEGAL SHOWDOWN OVER THE PROPOSED RECALL OF MILLIONS OF GENERAL MOTORS PICK UP TRUCKS 
THE VEHICLES IN QUESTION FEATURE THE SO CALLED SIDE SADDLE FUEL TANKS WHICH CRITICS SAY MAKES THE TRUCKS PRONE TO CATCH FIRE IN CERTAIN KINDS OF ACCIDENTS 
G. M. HAS ALWAYS SAID THE TRUCKS ARE SAFE 
THIS AFTERNOON TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY FEDERICO PENA ANNOUNCED THAT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE ALLEGED DEFECTS IN THE TRUCKS HAS ENDED 
IN EXCHANGE G. M. HAS PROMISED TO SPEND MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF FEDERAL AUTO SAFETY PROGRAMS 
DON GONYEA REPORTS FROM DETROIT 
THE SETTLEMENT COMES JUST DAYS BEFORE THE START OF A PUBLIC HEARING IN WASHINGTON THAT WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON THE SAFETY OF THE G. M. FULL SIZED TRUCKS BUILT FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
THAT HEARING PROMISED TO BE A PUBLIC RELATIONS NIGHTMARE FOR G. M. IN THAT AMONG THOSE SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY WERE BURN VICTIMS AND RELATIVES OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN FIERY CRASHES IN G. M. TRUCKS 
IT WAS TWO MONTHS AGO THAT TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY PENA CALLED FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING 
AT THE TIME HE SAID THE TRUCKS POSED AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF FIRE AND HE CRITICIZED THE COMPANY FOR KNOWINGLY PRODUCING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE 
G. M. COUNTERED WITH EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT THE OVERALL FATALITY RATE WAS COMPARABLE TO OTHER TRUCKS AND FAR BETTER THAN MOST CARS ON THE ROAD 
FURTHER G. M. SAID THE TRUCKS MET ALL FEDERAL STANDARDS WHEN THEY WERE BUILT 
G. M. PROMISED TO FIGHT ANY RECALL ATTEMPT IN COURT 
WITH A LENGTHY LEGAL BATTLE INEVITABLE COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT OWN TECHNICAL ADVISERS RECOMMENDED AGAINST A RECALL THE SECRETARY LOOKED FOR A WAY TO SETTLE THE MATTER 
TODAY HE ANNOUNCED A DEAL SAYING MORE LIVES WOULD BE SAVED IF G. M. AGREES TO FUND SAFETY RESEARCH AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAN IF THE SIX MILLION OR SO TRUCKS STILL ON THE ROAD HAD BEEN RECALLED 
I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS CASE HAS BEEN FOR ME 
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO OPTIONS THAT I'VE HAD AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THESE TRUCKS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON OUR HIGHWAYS WHILE THIS LITIGATION WAS PROCEEDING AND THE OPTION THAT WE HAVE TODAY WHICH IS TO DO SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY TO SAVE MANY MORE LIVES AND THOUSANDS OF INJURIES THIS IS THE ONE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT AND I THINK HAS A BROADER POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE AMERICAN TRAVELING PUBLIC 
THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT I HAVE BEFORE ME AND I THINK I HAVE MADE THE ONE THE BEST POSSIBLE INTEREST 
G. M. OFFICIALS CALLED THE SETTLEMENT A GOOD ONE THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVEN SAFER CARS AND TRUCKS BUT CONSUMER GROUPS SAID THE DEAL AMOUNTED TO LITTLE MORE THAN A BRIBE WITH G. M. BUYING OFF FEDERAL OFFICIALS BY PROMISING TO FUND PROGRAMS 
HERE'S JOHN CLAYBROOK OF PUBLIC CITIZEN 
WE'RE VERY DISTURBED THAT THIS DECISION HAS BEEN MADE 
WE THINK THAT THE SECRETARY HAD NO REASON TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION BEFORE THE PUBLIC HEARING BEFORE ALLOWING THE PUBLIC AS THE STATUTE PROVIDES TO HAVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK 
AND I THINK THAT THE REASON THAT GENERAL MOTORS WANTED TO DO THIS IS BECAUSE THE THE SHINING LIGHT OF PUBLICITY WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEM AND FOR THEIR THEIR CUSTOMERS 
THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LAWSUITS PENDING AGAINST G. M. RELATING TO THE TRUCKS BUT ANALYSTS POINT OUT THAT A RECALL ORDER WOULD HAVE LED TO EVEN MORE SUITS BEING FILED AGAINST THE AUTO MAKER
