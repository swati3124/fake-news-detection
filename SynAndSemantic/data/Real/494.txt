THE ARMY IS ON MANEUVERS IN MICHIGAN'S NORTHERN WOODS BUT IT'S NOT THE U. S. MILITARY 
THIS ONE IS PRIVATE 
THEY'RE ARMED THEY SAY THEY'RE PATRIOTS AND THEY'LL FIGHT IF NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES FROM WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE THE ABUSES OF EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT 
THE MEN CALL THEMSELVES THE NORTHERN MICHIGAN REGIONAL MILITIA 
THEY CLAIM TO HAVE TWELVE THOUSAND MEMBERS 
RECENT GUN CONTROL LAWS HAVE FUELED THEIR ANGER 
CONCERNED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY SIMILAR CITIZEN MILITIAS HAVE POPPED IN MORE THAN TWO DOZEN STATES 
MICHELLE OF PUBLIC RADIO ATTENDED A RECENT ASSEMBLY OF THE MICHIGAN MILITIA AND HAS THIS REPORT 
ON A FARM OUTSIDE A TOWN CALLED SEVENTY FIVE MEN AND WOMEN PATRIOTS OF THE NORTHERN MICHIGAN REGIONAL MILITIA STAND AT EASE 
ALL OF THEM ARE DRESSED IN CAMOUFLAGE FATIGUES INCLUDING THE CHAPLAIN WHO BEGINS THE DAY WITH A SPIRITUAL MESSAGE 
A ROW OF SEMI AUTOMATIC AND BOLT ACTION RIFLES IS PROPPED UP BEHIND HIM 
WE NEED TO KNOW COLLECTIVELY THAT WE'RE RIGHT 
AND THEN WHEN OUR OWN ARMY AND NAVY DECIDES TO STAND AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE'LL CALL IN A HIGHER COURT 
THIS MILITIA WAS FORMED LAST APRIL 
THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER TELLS THE PATRIOTS THEY ARE NOW THOUSANDS STRONG IN THE MILITIA MOVEMENT IN SIXTY FIVE MICHIGAN COUNTIES 
MICHIGAN HAS THE LARGEST STANDING UNORGANIZED WELL REGULATED MILITIA IN THE WORLD TODAY 
AND I DARESAY THAT WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WE'LL HAVE THE LARGEST STANDING MILITIA OUR U. S. ARMY AND WITHIN A YEAR WE'LL OUTNUMBER ALL THE ARMIES IN THE WORLD 
ON THIS DAY ABOUT EIGHT NEW MEMBERS ARE SWORN IN ON THE SPOT 
THAT I WILL OBEY 
I WILL OBEY 
THE ORDERS OF THOSE 
THE ORDERS OF THOSE 
APPOINTED OVER ME 
APPOINTED OVER ME 
FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE 
FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE 
SO HELP ME GOD 
SO HELP ME GOD 
WHY DID YOU JOIN UP TODAY WITH THE NORTHERN MICHIGAN REGIONAL MILITIA 
WELL I SPENT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN THE MARINE CORPS SO I STILL FEEL LIKE I CAN DEFEND MY COUNTRY 
AND WITH SOME OF THE STUFF GOING ON TODAY I DON'T THINK 
ANDREWS OF 
WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I WASN'T REALLY READY TO JOIN TODAY BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT I GOT KIND OF SWEPT BY IT 
LIKE THOSE WHO JOINED MILITIAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THESE MEN AND WOMEN SAY THEY OBJECT TO U. S. GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER THEIR LIVES 
THEY DENOUNCE RECENT GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION AND SEE THE UNITED NATIONS AS A SERIOUS THREAT TO U. S. SOVEREIGNTY 
INFORMATION OFFICER RAY IS MARRIED WITH THREE CHILDREN 
HE USED TO BE A NURSE AND IS NOW A REAL ESTATE AGENT 
HE SAYS HE LOST HIS LAST JOB BECAUSE OF HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE MILITIA 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED OF CITIZENS WITH WEAPONS AND I GUESS I KEEP ASKING THE NEWS MEDIA SHOW ME ONE EXAMPLE IN AMERICA WHERE SOMEBODY IN CAMOUFLAGE HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT HAS FRIGHTENED OR HARMED CITIZENS 
WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT PARAMILITARY GROUPS 
TELL ME WHERE THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM IN AMERICA 
THESE ARE CITIZENS JOINING AND PARTICIPATING IN A CONSTITUTIONAL MILITIA TO STAND UP AGAINST WHAT PATRICK HENRY KNEW WOULD OCCUR TYRANNY 
IN THE COLD MORNING DRIZZLE BESIDE A HIGHWAY THE MILITIAMEN SPREAD OUT INTO TWO LINES AS PART OF A SEARCH AND RESCUE EXERCISE 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A FICTITIOUS BOY WITH A BROKEN LEG 
WELL IF YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR COURSE AT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY YOU'RE GOING TO STAY ON THAT COURSE FOR TEN MINUTES FOR A TEN MINUTE WALK O. K. LOOKING FOR 
LATER THE MILITIA WILL FIRE WEAPONS DURING TARGET PRACTICE ON THE PRIVATE PROPERTY 
SAYS THEY'RE PREPARING FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO 
IT'S A DEFENSIVE SITUATION WHERE WE MAY HAVE TO GO TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOME TO HELP THEM DEFEND THEIR HOME 
AGAINST WHOM 
TYRANTS 
AND WHO WOULD YOU DEFINE AS TYRANTS 
ALL RIGHT 
IF YOU SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION AND I SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION ANYONE THAT WOULD BREAK THAT CONSTITUTION WOULD BE A 
YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT ASSEMBLY WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS 
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DETERIORATION OF THAT CONSTITUTION AND WE'RE HERE TO DEFEND IT 
SUCH TALK HAS LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES KEEPING AN EYE ON THE MICHIGAN MILITIA 
BUT OFFICIALS SAY THERE'S LITTLE THEY CAN DO AS LONG AS THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES REMAIN LEGAL 
THE U. S. ATTORNEY FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN MICHAEL SAYS HIS BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED STATEWIDE 
HE'S WATCHING TO SEE HOW THE GROUP EVOLVES 
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES DO THEY MOVE FROM A PROTEST MOVEMENT FROM DISSENT TO EXTREMISM TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
AND MOVING FROM DOMESTIC DISSENT TO EXTREMISM THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT 
THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WHEN THEY MOVE FROM EXTREMISM TO TERRORISM 
HISTORY TELLS US THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE TYPES OF GROUPS 
KLAN WATCH IN MONTGOMERY ALABAMA IS ALSO MONITORING THE GROWING MILITIA MOVEMENT AND SUGGESTS THERE MAY BE LINKS BETWEEN SUCH GROUPS AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS A CHARGE THAT THE MICHIGAN MILITIA DENIES 
THEY SAY THEIR PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AGAINST GOVERNMENT TYRANNY 
THEY USE THE FEDERAL SIEGE OF THE BRANCH DAVIDIAN COMPOUND IN WACO TEXAS AS THEIR RALLYING CRY 
GIVES A MORE RECENT EXAMPLE OF A MICHIGAN MAN WHO BROKE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS BY PUTTING IN PONDS ON HIS WETLANDS AND WAS CONFRONTED BY ARMED AUTHORITIES 
IF THAT OCCURS AGAIN AND HE WOULD CONTACT THE MILITIA THERE WOULD BE AN ALERT THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE STATE THAT THERE'S AN ARMED ASSAULT ON A CITIZEN'S HOME AND LET THE CONSCIENCE BE THEIR GUIDE 
THE MILITIA WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT THEM BUT THEY ALSO LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDER FOR ANYONE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THEIR OPERATIONS 
FORTY EIGHT YEAR OLD NORM OLSON IS A BAPTIST MINISTER AND STATE COMMANDER OF THE MICHIGAN MILITIA CORPS 
HE'S CONVINCED THAT SOME DAY THE AUTHORITIES WILL LURE THE MILITIA INTO BATTLE SIMILAR TO WACO 
WE SEE A CONSPIRACY HERE A TWO PRONG CONSPIRACY EITHER TO BRING US INTO A FIRE FIGHT TO DESTROY US THAT WAY OR TO DESTROY US BY LEGISLATION TO MAKE US ILLEGAL 
A DON'T TREAD ON ME FLAG FLIES OUT FRONT A SPORT SHOP ON THE FARM WHERE THE PATRIOTS ARE TRAINING 
OLSON SAYS THE NORTHERN MICHIGAN REGIONAL MILITIA WILL OPPOSE FORCES DESIGNED TO DESTROY THEM 
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY 
THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP US
