ONE OF THE MANY CONFLICTS THE UNITED NATIONS IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO MEDIATE TOOK A DRAMATIC TURN TODAY 
IN THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA SEPARATIST REBELS IN THE NORTHWESTERN REGION OF ABKHAZIA CAPTURED THE CAPITAL 
THE GUERRILLAS WHO WANT AN INDEPENDENT STATE IN ABKHAZIA TOOK THE CITY AFTER AN ELEVEN DAY SIEGE 
GEORGIA'S LEADER EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE REMAINED IN THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE BUT TODAY HE REPORTEDLY LEFT THE CITY 
FROM MOSCOW NPR'S MIKE SHUSTER HAS MORE 
SHEVARDNADZE REMAINED AS CLOSE TO THE FIGHTING IN AS HE COULD WITHOUT PUTTING HIMSELF DIRECTLY UNDER THE FALLING SHELLS 
ONLY WHEN IT SEEMED TODAY THAT THE GEORGIAN TROOPS FIGHTING TO HOLD ONTO THE CITY'S CENTER WERE GOING TO CRACK DID SHEVARDNADZE LEAVE HIS HEADQUARTERS FOR A SAFER POSITION BELIEVED TO BE LOCATED A FEW MILES SOUTH OF THE CITY 
SHEVARDNADZE ISSUED A BITTER STATEMENT THROUGH IS OFFICE IN GEORGIA'S CAPITAL BLAMING RUSSIA FOR THE GEORGIAN DEFEAT 
RUSSIA HAD PLEDGED TO GUARANTEE A CEASE FIRE BOTH SIDES SIGNED IN LATE JULY BUT THEN THE SEPARATISTS BROKE THE CEASE FIRE NEARLY TWO WEEKS AGO AND BEGAN THE SIEGE OF RUSSIA DID NOTHING AND CONTINUED TO DO NOTHING THROUGHOUT THE BATTLE 
DURING THE YEAR LONG WAR RUSSIA OR AT LEAST LOCAL RUSSIAN COMMANDERS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF GIVING THE REBELS MILITARY SUPPORT 
GEORGIA WAS PRACTICALLY ON ITS KNEES THE STATEMENT SAID FROM SHEVARDNADZE BUT EVEN THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RUSSIA 
STATEMENT ACCUSED THE OF ACTIONS AND SAID THAT HUNDRED OF PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE BATTLE AND MANY BUILDINGS DESTROYED 
ONE WESTERN CORRESPONDENT WHO LEFT THE CITY ON SATURDAY REPORTED THAT ITS COASTLINE WAS LIGHTED BY FIRES 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE FLED 
TODAY RUSSIAN SHIPS OFF THE COAST WERE REPORTED TO HAVE EVACUATED SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FROM THE CITY 
OFFICIALS OF THE SEPARATISTS SAID THEIR TROOPS WERE NOT ATTACKING THE RETREATING GEORGIAN FORCES 
THE SEPARATISTS ALSO PLEDGED TO PERMIT SHEVARDNADZE TO LEAVE THE AREA UNHARMED 
EARLIER RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN OFFERED TO ASSIST IN GETTING SHEVARDNADZE OUT BUT THE GEORGIAN LEADER REFUSED 
THE WAR FOR ABKHAZIA BROKE OUT IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR AND IN SPORADIC FIGHTING HAS LEFT AN ESTIMATED TWO THOUSAND DEAD 
BUT THE TWO SIDES HAD FOUGHT TO A STANDSTILL THIS PAST JULY WITH THE IN CONTROL OF MOST OF THE PROVINCE BUT THE GEORGIANS HOLDING 
SO THEY SIGNED A CEASE FIRE AND THERE WAS MUCH HOPE A PEACE COULD BE ARRANGED 
SHEVARDNADZE TOOK THE CEASE FIRE SERIOUSLY AND ORDERED HEAVY WEAPONS REMOVED FROM THE CITY 
WHEN THE BROKE THE CEASE FIRE THE GEORGIANS WERE EXPOSED AND NEARLY HELPLESS 
WHERE THIS LEAVES GEORGIA'S BATTERED GOVERNMENT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR 
THE CONTROL MOST OF THE PROVINCE INCLUDING ITS MOST IMPORTANT CITIES 
TODAY THEY OFFERED TO BEGIN PEACE TALKS IN GENEVA LATER THIS WEEK 
ASSUMING SHEVARDNADZE IS SAFE IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WILL SURVIVE POLITICALLY AFTER THIS DEFEAT 
A SPOKESMAN IN SAID HE WOULD REMAIN NEAR THE CITY TO OVERSEE THE EVACUATION OF REFUGEES 
TODAY IN THE STATEMENT HE RELEASED HE SOUNDED SADDENED AND SOBER 
GOD KNOWS I DID ALL I COULD SO THAT THIS TERRIBLE DAY WOULD NEVER COME THE STATEMENT READ 
MAY I BE FORGIVEN IT CONTINUED BY MY CONTEMPORARIES AND THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME
