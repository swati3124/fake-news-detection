A SENSITIVITY TO WHEAT CAN CAUSE SOME MAJOR EATING PROBLEMS AND C. N. N.'S FOOD AND HEALTH CORRESPONDENT CAROLYN O'NEIL REPORTS 
AT THE POTTS FAMILY FARM IN OREGON CITY HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN SO EASY 
WHEN HARVEY POTTS WAS A SEVEN YEAR OLD HE DEVELOPED A SENSITIVITY TO WHEAT 
THAT MEANT MOST CEREALS CRACKERS AND COOKIES WERE OFF LIMITS 
IN SOME WAYS IT WAS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE OTHERS COULDN'T REALLY RELATE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ALLERGIES 
PHYLLIS POTTS HAS A SENSITIVITY TO WHEAT TOO 
A TRUE ALLERGY TO WHEAT IS RARE AND CAN BE LIFE THREATENING BUT PHYLLIS POTTS SAYS SHE'S CONVINCED IN HER CASE AND HER SON'S TO BLAME FOR A VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS 
I HAVE A LOT OF DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS I'LL FEEL A LITTLE IRRITABLE I'LL FEEL TIRED VERY TIRED 
SO IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL BETTER TO AVOID IT 
THAT'S WHY PHYLLIS SET OUT TO FIND WHEAT FREE RECIPES 
BUT PHYLLIS POTTS COULDN'T FIND A COOKBOOK OF WHEAT FREE RECIPES SO SHE WROTE ONE HERSELF RIGHT HERE 
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF DESKTOP PUBLISHING WELL THIS IS MORE LIKE DINING ROOM PUBLISHING 
OVER THE COURSE OF FIFTEEN YEARS PHYLLIS HAS REWORKED HUNDREDS OF WHEAT FREE RECIPES AND NOW SHE'S PUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OF THEM INTO HER OWN COOKBOOK GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN 
RECIPES RANGE FROM EMILY DELICATE RICE CAKE TO CHOCOLATE TO A BACON QUICHE 
EVEN TOUGHEST CRITICS GIVE THUMBS UP 
IT USED TO BE THAT SHE WOULD TELL ME SHE'S MAKING WHEAT FREE AND I WOULDN'T LIKE THEM 
AND NOW IT'S SHE DOESN'T EVEN TELL ME AND JUST MAKES THEM YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN HARDLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE 
BUT WHEN THE WHEAT HAS TO GO SOMETHING ELSE HAS TO WORK 
PHYLLIS SAYS HER SECRET IS A COMBINATION OF RICE CHICK PEA OR BEAN FLOWERS 
THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO MAKES A REALLY NICE COOKIE MAKES PRETTY GOOD BREAD MAKES A VERY NICE PIE CRUST 
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A BEST SELLER THE RESPONSE TO THE BOOK SHOWS THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SHARE THE NEED FOR WHEAT FREE RECIPES 
SO FAR SHE'S SOLD ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED COPIES 
A LOAF OF BREAD IS STILL A LITTLE BIT ELUSIVE 
I DO MAKE BREAD BUT I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS THE PERFECT BREAD YET 
BUT AS PHYLLIS CONTINUES TO EXPERIMENT IN HER FARMHOUSE KITCHEN THAT ELUSIVE LOAF OF WHEAT FREE BREAD IS ALMOST READY THANKS TO A GRAIN CALLED 
AND SINCE MORE AND MORE RECIPES ARE PILING UP ON HER DINING ROOM TABLE BOOK NUMBER TWO IS WELL UNDERWAY
