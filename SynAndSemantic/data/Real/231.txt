IN RUSSIA BORIS YELTSIN DECLARED THIS A DAY OF NATIONAL MOURNING FOR THOSE WHO WERE KILLED IN THE UPRISING 
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT NOW PUTS THE FIGURE AT ONE EIGHTY SEVEN PEOPLE KILLED 
WE MUST ALL MAKE SURE MR. YELTSIN SAID THIS TRAGEDY CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN. MR. YELTSIN ALSO SPENT ANOTHER DAY GOING AFTER HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES 
HE SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WHICH HAD TRIED TO STOP HIM FROM PARLIAMENT 
MR. YELTSIN'S NEXT POLITICAL TARGETS ARE OUTSIDE MOSCOW 
THEY'RE CALLED LOCAL COUNCILS FROM THE DAYS OF COMMUNIST RULE 
THERE ARE EIGHTY EIGHT OF THEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY HALF OF THEM SIDED WITH MR. YELTSIN'S RIVALS IN THE PARLIAMENT INCLUDING ONE IN THE REGION 
AND THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S JIM LAURIE 
THEY'RE POLITICIANS ON THE ROPES 
ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM MOSCOW MEMBERS OF THE REGIONAL SOVIET OR LOCAL COUNCIL 
TWO WEEKS AGO THEY REFUSED TO SUPPORT BORIS YELTSIN BACKING THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT INSTEAD 
NOW THEY'RE BACK AS FAST AS THEY CAN SAYING THEY MADE A MISTAKE BY SUPPORTING RUTSKOI AND KHASBULATOV THE JAILED REBEL LEADERS 
I FEEL HURT BETRAYED BY THEM 
WE FAVORED COMPROMISE NOT CONFRONTATION 
YELTSIN WANTS LOCAL COUNCILS LIKE THIS ONE TO A MOVE MANY HERE SUPPORT 
WE HAVE JUST A BUNCH OF COMMUNISTS ON OUR LOCAL COUNCIL 
THEY'RE ALWAYS SITTING ON THE NECK OF THE PEOPLE 
BUT WITH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS SET FOR DECEMBER YELTSIN WILL NEED TO DO MORE THAN CRACK DOWN ON COMMUNISTS TO WIN SUPPORT 
WHATEVER THE THOUGHTS ABOUT YELTSIN'S CRACK DOWN THEY ARE OVERSHADOWED IN REGIONS LIKE THIS ONE BY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
YELTSIN'S LOCAL CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS A WORRIED MAN 
WE'VE GOT GREAT PROBLEMS 
MANY HERE WHO BACKED US IN THE PAST NOW OPPOSE US 
THEY HAVE THEIR REASONS 
EARNS JUST TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH IN THIS AUTO PARTS FACTORY WHICH OFTEN PRODUCTION FOR DAYS AT A TIME 
YELTSIN'S WORD SOUNDED GOOD IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN WE ELECTED HIM BUT HIS DEEDS SINCE DO NOT JUSTIFY OUR CONFIDENCE 
FACTORIES WERE ONCE AT THE HEART OF THE SOVIET MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX 
THIS IS NOW A PLACE OF THE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDERPAID FACING EVER RISING PRICES 
THE BATTLE IN MOSCOW YELTSIN SAYS WAS FOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF RAPID ECONOMIC REFORM 
NOW THE BATTLE IS TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT RUSSIA THAT REFORM IS REALLY GOOD FOR THEM 
JIM LAURIE A. B. C. NEWS RUSSIA 
WE HAVE ONE LAST ITEM FROM OVERSEAS 
THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF PAKISTAN BHUTTO MAY SOON BE PRIME MINISTER AGAIN 
THREE YEARS AFTER SHE WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE MS. BHUTTO'S PARTY WON THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SEATS IN YESTERDAY'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS 
SHE WILL NOW TRY TO FORM A GOVERNING COALITION 
AND IF SHE SUCCEEDS SHE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A STUNNING COMEBACK 
WHEN WE COME BACK GANG VIOLENCE HOW ONE CITY HAS TRIED TO SILENCE THE GUNS
