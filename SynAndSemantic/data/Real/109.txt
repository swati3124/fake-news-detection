THE FIRST LADY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON 
AMERICANS GENERALLY LIKE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON BUT ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL THEY'RE NOT FOND OF HER MAIDEN NAME 
SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED WANT HER TO DROP IT 
ELIZABETH NOW WHAT ABOUT THIS NAME THING 
HILLARY USED HER MAIDEN NAME FOR YEARS BUT DROPPED IT WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR 
NOW SHE'S BACK 
WHY THE CHANGE AND WHY IS IT CONTROVERSIAL 
WELL YOU KNOW SHAKESPEARE SAID A ROSE BY ANY NAME SMELLS JUST AS SWEET 
AND I THINK THAT THE NAME CONTROVERSY WILL BLOW OVER AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHE CAN MAKE AS A VERY WELL EDUCATED LAWYER AND SOMEONE WHO'S HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE 
THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT HER IN CHARGE OF THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS ON THE AMERICAN AGENDA AND ON HIS AGENDA AND THAT'S HEALTH CARE POLICY 
AND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HER MIDDLE NAME THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHETHER SHE CAN PRODUCE IN THIS AREA PRODUCE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PACKAGE 
WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN THIS COUNTRY 
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS HEALTH CARE COSTS THAT ARE NOT BEING COVERED 
WE HAVE KIDS WHO ARE NOT BEING 
WE HAVE EPIDEMICS OF TUBERCULOSIS MEASLES AND THE LIKE 
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AND GET OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM UNDER CONTROL 
LIZ I AGREE WITH YOU 
IN FACT AS YOU AS WE ALL WELL KNOW THE PRESIDENT CHANGED HIS NAME TO WILLIAM J. I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT ABOUT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S NAME 
IT MAY BE ONE ABOUT HER ROLE 
I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DEFINED A ROLE FOR HER 
I WOULD ONLY HOPE QUITE FRANKLY THAT HE WOULD DEFINE A ROLE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT A MAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECTED 
YOU KNOW WHAT NAME HILLARY USES IS THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT THING THAT HAPPENED ALL WEEK 
LET ME COMMENT THOUGH ON WHAT WAS SAID A LITTLE EARLIER ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
YOU KNOW THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN TOLERANT AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SO MANY PRO CHOICE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN OUR ELECTED AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WITHIN OUR PARTY 
ALSO YOU SEE GAYS 
THANK YOU BAY 
I TAKE THAT AS A GREAT SUPPORT 
YOU SEE GAYS INVOLVED IN THE PARTY 
THE PROBLEM IS WE DO HAVE CERTAIN PRINCIPLES 
PEOPLE JOIN OUR PARTY BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTION WE'RE TAKING THE COUNTRY 
THEY MAY DISAGREE WITH PARTS OF IT BUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WE NEED TO COMPROMISE WE NEED TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE 
YOU DON'T BREAK YOUR PRINCIPLES 
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU COMPROMISE 
YOU COMPROMISE ON POLICIES WITH COMING IN AN ADMINISTRATION 
THE PARTY CANNOT WALK AWAY FROM ITS PRINCIPLES WHETHER THEY BE SMALL BUSINESS ORIENTED ECONOMIC LIMITED GOVERNMENT POLICIES OR TRADITIONAL VALUE POLICIES 
BAY LET ME INTERRUPT THERE 
DO YOU SEE HILLARY AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY 
IT DEPENDS ON HOW IN HOW SHE WORKS OUT 
I THINK SHE COULD BE A GREAT ASSET TO THE PRESIDENT BUT I'LL TELL YOU IN THE ROLE SHE'S IN RIGHT NOW AS COMPETENT AS SHE DEFINITELY IS WHEN SHE COMES OUT WITH A SPECIFIC POLICY IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT POLICY YOU CAN'T EXACTLY CUT YOUR LOSSES AND PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN THERE 
YOU CAN'T THROW OUT THE FIRST LADY 
SO THERE'S GOING BE REAL PROBLEMS RESULTING AS A RESULT OF HER TAKING A POLICY POSITION BUT THAT'S ONE THAT THEY'VE AGREED TO TO GO THROUGH WITH AND MORE POWER TO THEM 
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
PERHAPS IN THE WORDS OF ONE OBSERVERS IN TWENTY YEARS WE WON'T THINK TWICE 
I'D LIKE TO THANK TODAY'S GUESTS 
WELL SHE'S SHE'LL BE A TARGET
