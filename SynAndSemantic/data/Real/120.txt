IT'S ALL THINGS CONSIDERED 
I'M LINDA WERTHEIMER 
AND I'M NOAH ADAMS 
ZAIRE'S REGULAR ARMY TROOPS TOOK CONTROL OF TWO KEY MILITARY BASES IN THE CAPITAL OF KINSHASA TODAY AND TURNED BACK LEAD FORCES LOYAL TO PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
THE REBELLION WHICH BEGAN WITH RIOTING LAST WEEK APPEARS TO BE THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT TO THIRTY TWO YEAR RULE 
TODAY'S FIGHTING COMES AFTER FRANCE BELGIUM AND THE UNITED STATES ISSUED A JOINT DECLARATION YESTERDAY IN BRUSSELS CALLING FOR MOBUTU TO STEP DOWN 
NPR'S SUNNI KHALID REPORTS ON U. S. REACTION TO EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN NATION 
TIME MAY FINALLY BE RUNNING OUT ON THE LONG REIGN OF ZAIRE'S EMBATTLED PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
AS MANY AS ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE REPORTEDLY DIED IN WEEK LONG BLOODSHED IN ZAIRE'S CAPITAL OF KINSHASA THIS WEEK WHERE TROOPS HAVE APPARENTLY GAINED THE UPPER HAND 
THEY'VE BEEN BATTLING SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL DIVISION KNOWN IN ZAIRE AS THE D. S. P. RECRUITED FROM OWN ETHNIC GROUP AND PAID DIRECTLY BY HIM THE D. S. P. HAS KEPT MOBUTU IN POWER 
BUT THIS WEEK THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONTAIN REGULAR TROOPS WHO THIS WEEK AFTER PAID WITH WORTHLESS MONEY PRINTED BY MOBUTU 
STEVE WEISSMAN A FORMER STAFF DIRECTOR OF THE HOUSE AFRICA SUB COMMITTEE SAYS THE APPARENT D. S. P. SETBACKS THREATEN SURVIVAL 
THE ARMY ITSELF HAS VERY LITTLE POWER EXCEPT FOR THE D. S. P. 
THE D. S. P. HAS BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE GROUP OF FORCES 
IT'S BEEN THE SUPPORTER OF POWER AND IF THE D. S. P. IS FADING THEN MOBUTU IS FADING 
TWO YEARS AGO MOBUTU WAS PRESSURED BY HIS MAIN FOREIGN DONORS THE UNITED STATES BELGIUM AND FRANCE TO ALLOW THE FORMATION OF OPPOSITION PARTIES AND THOSE PARTIES HAVE FORMED A TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT LED BY 
BUT MOBUTU HAS THWARTED THEIR ATTEMPTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE ECONOMY 
ONCE REGARDED AS AN ALLY DURING THE COLD WAR WESTERN POWERS HELPED MOBUTU SEIZE POWER TWICE IN MILITARY COUPS BUT THE ZAIREAN LEADER'S DICTATORIAL RULE HAS GRADUALLY FORCED THEM TO WITHDRAW ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT 
MICHAEL A SCHOLAR ON ZAIRE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN AT MADISON SAYS THE FORMAL WESTERN ABANDONMENT FROM MOBUTU IS SIGNIFICANT 
IT'S THOSE STATES WHICH HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE IN LARGE MEASURE FOR KEEPING HIM IN POWER OVER THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS THE UNITED STATES BELGIUM AND FRANCE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TOLD MOBUTU THAT THE GAME IS OVER THAT IT'S TIME THAT HE THINK ABOUT DEPARTING FROM THE POLITICAL SCENE 
THAT REALLY HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE 
THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF DISCONTENT BUT THE VOICES PUBLICLY HAVE BEEN MUTED 
THIS TIME THEY ARE NOT MUTED 
OPPONENTS REPEATED CALLS THIS WEEK FOR A FOREIGN MILITARY INTERVENTION TO OVERTHROW HIM BUT THAT APPEARS UNLIKELY 
HOWEVER FORMER WESTERN SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE A MORE POWERFUL THREAT CONTROL OVER THE ZAIREAN LEADER'S CONSIDERABLE WEALTH 
MOBUTU OWNS SEVERAL LARGE FOREIGN AND HAS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FOREIGN BANKS 
IF MOBUTU DOES NOT AGREE TO STEP ASIDE HIS FORMER WESTERN BANKERS ARE CONSIDERING PLACING A FREEZE ON HIS ASSETS AND EXPELLING ZAIREAN AMBASSADORS 
SOME ANALYSTS LIKE ROBERT CUMMINGS FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AFRICAN STUDIES AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON SAY ZAIRE MAY BECOME ANOTHER LIBERIA IF MOBUTU IGNORES CALLS TO GIVE UP POWER 
THE QUESTION FOR ME THOUGH IS WHETHER OR NOT HE SEES THAT PRESSURE AS IMMINENTLY AS WE WANT TO SEE IT FROM THIS SIDE 
I REMEMBER THE CASE OF SAM DO OVER IN LIBERIA WHO WAS AT A SIMILAR PLACE IN HIS OWN HISTORICAL LIBERIAN PERIOD AND TOO HE FAILED TO SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL SO MUCH SO THAT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE IN THE LIBERIAN CASE AND I'M HOPING THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN WITH MOBUTU 
MEANWHILE MOBUTU HAS SO FAR REMAINED FAR AWAY FROM THE TURMOIL 
FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS HE'S LIVED ON A YACHT SAILING UP AND DOWN THE ZAIRE RIVER OR AT A PRESIDENTIAL PALACE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CAPITAL WHERE HE RARELY SETS FOOT
