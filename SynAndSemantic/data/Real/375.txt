C. N. N.'S TONY CLARK REPORTS THE FRUSTRATION OF FREEWAY GRIDLOCK COULD BE BY THE FREEDOM OF FLIGHT 
DID YOU EVER GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND WISH YOU COULD TURN YOUR CAR INTO A PLANE AND JUST FLY ABOVE IT ALL 
TEXAS ENGINEER KEN HAS 
WHEN MY I HAD MY CHILDREN I'D BE GOING DOWN THE ROAD ON A TRIP YOU KNOW OUT ON THE HIGHWAY AND I WOULD ALWAYS TEASE THEM THAT PULL BACK ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OFF AND FLY ON OUR TRIP 
AND I WOULD ALWAYS DO THAT 
NOW IS TRYING TO TURN THAT DREAM INTO A REALITY 
THIS IS THE PROTOTYPE OF HIS AIR CAR 
WE START THE AIR CAR JUST LIKE YOU START YOUR CAR WITH A KEY IN THE IGNITION SWITCH 
IS THE DESIGNER OF A TILT ROTOR AIRPLANE AND WAS THE LEAD ENGINE AT BELL HELICOPTER BEFORE TAKING EARLY RETIREMENT 
HE PROBABLY HAS A GOOD CHANCE OF MAKING THIS THING WORK 
HE'S A GOOD PRACTICAL ENGINEER 
THE IDEA FOR A FLYING CAR HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF AIRPLANES 
THIS NINETEEN SEVENTEEN ISSUE OF SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FEATURES ONE MAN'S ATTEMPT 
IT FLEW BUT NOT VERY WELL 
IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OTHER TRIES 
ONE OF THEM WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PRODUCED OUT IN SAN DIEGO BY THE CORPORATION AND THEY WERE WELL INTO PROJECTING UPWARD OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR 
BUT THE MARKET DID NOT MATERIALIZE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO 
THE KEY TO DESIGN IS A SINGLE LIGHTWEIGHT ENGINE AND WINGS COMPACT ENOUGH TO ALLOW IT TO TRAVEL IN A SINGLE LANE OF TRAFFIC 
HAS FLOWN RADIO CONTROLLED MODELS OF HIS AIR CAR AND HAS CONDUCTED WIND TUNNEL TESTS 
HIS CURRENT FULL SIZED CAN OPERATE LIKE A CAR 
THE NEXT STEP IS TO BUILD A FULL SIZED PROTOTYPE THAT WILL FLY

AND THAT'S THE REAL PRACTICAL THING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AIR CAR 
THE AIR CAR IS FEATURED ON THE COVER OF POPULAR MECHANICS MAGAZINE AND IS A FINALIST FOR DISCOVER MAGAZINE'S TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS AWARD 
THE CHALLENGE FACING KEN THOUGH IS TO PERFECT THE AIR CAR SO IT IS FEATURED IN PARKING LOTS
