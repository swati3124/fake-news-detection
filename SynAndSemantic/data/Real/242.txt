ARE A DISTINCTLY AMERICAN CULTURAL PHENOMENON A PLACE WHERE IF IT'S A REAL DINER YOU JUST DROP IN GET A CUP OF COFFEE A PIECE OF PIE AND SOME CONVERSATION 
SOME SAY ARE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK BUT OTHERS SAY THEY NEVER REALLY WENT ANYWHERE 
C. N. N.'S CAROLYN O'NEIL TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF AN AMERICAN ICON 
WHEN YOU THINK DINER THE FIFTIES COME TO MIND A PLACE TO HANG OUT BET A BURGER AND A SHAKE AND LISTEN TO THE BOX 
BUT THE ROOTS GO WAY BACK TO THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 
STARTED OUT AS HORSE DRAWN LUNCH WAGON IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHICH CAME OUT AFTER OTHER RESTAURANTS CLOSED FOR THE EVENING 
AND WHEN AMERICANS HIT THE ROAD THE SOON FOLLOWED 
THE POST WORLD WAR TWO PERIOD WAS REALLY THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE DINER 
BUT IT'S THE FIFTIES THEME THAT LIVES ON WITH EVERYTHING FROM NEON SIGNS TO GUM SMACKING WAITRESSES 
SOME SAY THE DINER IS MAKING A NOSTALGIC COMEBACK WHILE OTHERS SAY THE DINER NEVER LEFT 
THE FACT IS THERE'S A VARIATION ON THE THEME IN JUST ABOUT EVERY U. S. CITY 
IN CHICAGO ED DINER IS A CRAZY CARICATURE OF A FIFTIES DINER WHERE THE BURGERS AND ARE ALMOST AS POPULAR AS WAIT STAFF 
WE WANTED TO BRING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T GET ANYMORE AND THAT WAS SIMPLE BASIC DOWN HOME AMERICAN FOOD 
THEN THERE'S THE UPSCALE DINER 
THIS IS LIKE AN ELEGANT RAILROAD CAR TO ME YOU KNOW THAT YOU SEE ON THE EXPRESS 
DINER GOERS MAY NOT EXPECT BOOTHS AND ITALIAN MARBLE FLOORS BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY GET AT THE DINER IN ATLANTA 
WELL I LIKE IT BRINGS BACK MY CHILDHOOD DAYS THE THIRTIES FORTIES FIFTIES 
BUT THE MENU IS ALL NINETIES 
HOW ABOUT A SALMON LETTUCE AND TOMATO SANDWICH OR WITH VEAL AND WILD MUSHROOMS 
IT IS COMFORT FOODS 
IT IS A NEW TWIST TO IT IT IS SOMEWHAT UPSCALE 
IT FITS WITHIN THE NEW EATING HABITS AS WELL AS HAS THE OLD FAVORITES INVOLVED 
AND FOLKS AT THE SILVER DINER IN ROCKVILLE MARYLAND GET A LITTLE PHILOSOPHICAL 
IT'S A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET A PIECE OF PIE AND A CUP OF COFFEE 
THE PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETHING HOMEMADE SOMETHING THAT TASTES GOOD AND IS GOOD FOR YOU 
ACTUALLY THIS IS A BIT OF AMERICAN RIGHT HERE SO I ENJOY IT 
IT'S A GATHERING PLACE AND IT'S COMING BACK WITHOUT THE HORSE 
MAY CHANGE WITH THE TIMES BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAN A MENU HERE SOMETHING THAT'S A TASTE OF NOSTALGIA CUSTOMERS REALLY CRAVE
