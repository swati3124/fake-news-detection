THE TREASURES OF KING ARE ON DISPLAY AT THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IN CAIRO BUT NOW YOU CAN GET A LOOK AT WHAT THE BOY KING'S TOMB MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE WHEN HE WAS FIRST BURIED 
C. N. N.'S GAYLE YOUNG REPORTS 
WELCOME TO THE TREASURES OF KING TOMB THE MAGNIFICENT PRICELESS OBJECTS NEEDED BY THE BOY PHARAOH IN HIS AFTERLIFE 
BUT WAIT THIS STUFF IS WELL CERTAINLY NOT PRICELESS 
AND THESE CRAFTSMEN CERTAINLY AREN'T ANXIOUS 
IT'S ALL PART OF A SCHEME BY AN EGYPTIAN ENTREPRENEUR TO RECREATE AN EXACT REPLICA OF TOMB JUST AS IT WAS DISCOVERED IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO 
THE FOUR ROOMS OF THE TOMB WERE FILLED FROM BOTTOM TO CEILING WITH GLITTERING GOLD WITH STATUES WITH MANY MANY VALUABLE THINGS 
DOCTOR STARTED HIS PROJECT THREE YEARS AGO REMAKE EVERY ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF ITEMS DISCOVERED IN FAMOUS TOMB 
IT TOOK LESS TIME THAN IT TOOK BUT THEN THESE MODERN DAY TOMB WORKERS HAD A FEW MODERN INVENTIONS TO HELP THEM OUT 
NOT TO MENTION A FEW MODERN 
THEY ALSO CHEATED A BIT 
THAT'S PLASTIC NOT IVORY INTO THOSE CHAIRS 
AND THIS SOLID GOLD SARCOPHAGUS IT ISN'T 
OF COURSE

AT HIS TOURIST VILLAGE ACTORS RECREATE SCENES FROM THE TIME OF THE AND HE'S BANKING THE TOURISTS WOULD LIKE TO SEE KING TOMB JUST AS IT WAS OR PERHAPS AS HIS HERO WALT DISNEY OF DISNEYWORLD WOULD HAVE IMAGINED
