FEWER PEOPLE IN BRITAIN ARE BUYING RINGSIDE SEATS TO THE BIG TOP 
ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS AND THE RECESSION HAVE BATTERED BRITAIN'S CIRCUS INDUSTRY BUT AS C. N. N.'S JIM CLANCY REPORTS THE SHOW GOES ON 
CENTURIES OF ENTERTAINMENT TRADITIONS ARE UNDER INCREASED PRESSURE IN BRITAIN 
CIRCUSES ARE BATTLING TO SURVIVE AGAINST THE RECESSION WHILE ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS ACCUSE PATRONS OF HELPING TO SPONSOR CRUELTY AGAINST THE REAL STARS OF THE SHOW 
IN RESPONSE MANY CITY COUNCILS HAVE ADOPTED A BAN ON CIRCUSES WITH ANIMALS IN BRITAIN FORCING THE BIG TOPS TO SET UP MILES OUTSIDE OF TOWN 
IT'S ADDING TO ECONOMIC PRESSURE THAT'S ALREADY CHANGED THE BUSINESS 
IT HAS CHANGED ENORMOUSLY 
WE HAD TO PULL OURSELVES UP BY THE REALLY AND ABANDON A LOT OF THE OLD TRADITIONAL WAYS OF GOING ABOUT THE BUSINESS 
THE DAYS WHEN A FEW POSTERS IN TOWN WOULD BRING IN THE PUBLIC ARE GONE 
NOW THE PERFORMERS COLLECT TICKETS AND SELL PROGRAMS AT THE DOOR 
THE CLOWNS MAN THE SOUVENIR SHOP 
EVERYBODY 
I DO THE WITH A COUPLE OF THE OTHER AND SHOP 
THAT'S HELPED THIS CIRCUS SURVIVED WHILE MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FOLD THEIR TENTS IN BRITAIN FOR GOOD 
BEHIND THE BIG TOP AND OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHTS THE PERFORMERS WHO BRING THE CIRCUS TO LIFE DISAGREE WITH ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND INSIST THAT DESPITE HARD ECONOMIC TIMES THE SHOW WILL GO ON 
IT WILL GO ON 
IT'S GONE ON FOR GENERATIONS NOW ALREADY 
MY MOTHER COMES FROM GENERATION THAT IS SIXTY TO SEVENTY YEARS OF CIRCUS 
THIS CIRCUS HAS OPENED UP ITS GROUNDS FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE HOW THE ANIMALS ARE WELL TREATED 
IT'S ONE WAY OF FIGHTING TO KEEP THE CIRCUS WHAT IT IS 
I THINK PEOPLE COME TO SEE THE CIRCUS TO SEE THE CLOWNS AND THE ANIMALS 
THAT'S HOW CIRCUSES STARTED OFF WITH CLOWNS AND ANIMALS AND I THINK IF THERE'S NO ANIMALS IN CIRCUSES THERE WON'T BE ANY CIRCUSES 
IT'S AN OPINION SHARED BY PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE 
I LIKE THE ELEPHANT 
I LIKE THE ELEPHANT 
I LIKE TRICKS THAT DID 
BRITAIN'S OLDEST SURVIVING FAMILY CIRCUS IS DOING WELL BECAUSE IT HAS CHANGED ALONG WITH THE BUSINESS AND ATTITUDES ON ANIMAL RIGHTS 
IT MUST CHANGE IF THE CIRCUS IS TO REMAIN THE SAME
