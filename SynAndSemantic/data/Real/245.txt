IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE P. L. O. AND ISRAEL SAY THEY WILL BE READY FOR A MID DECEMBER TRANSITION OF POWER IN JERICHO AND THE GAZA STRIP 
WEDNESDAY THEY GOT DOWN TO THEIR FIRST SESSION OF DETAILED TALKS ON HOW THEY'LL DO THAT 
C. N. N.'S BILL DELANEY REPORTS A LOT STILL NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT 
ON THE DAY THE ISRAEL P. L. O. AGREEMENTS OF A MONTH AGO OFFICIALLY WENT INTO EFFECT IN THE EGYPTIAN RESORT TOWN OF ON THE ISRAELI BORDER ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATORS NEEDED TO NAIL DOWN THE NUANCES OF PALESTINIAN SELF RULE IN JERICHO AND THE GAZA STRIP 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE FUTURE THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF PEACE 
WITH SELF RULE FOR GAZA AND JERICHO AS CLOSE AS MID DECEMBER WHAT MUST BE DECIDED BY THEN INCLUDES WHEN EXACTLY AND TO WHERE EXACTLY WILL ISRAELI TROOPS WITHDRAW 
WITH THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS SIGNED UP FOR TRAINING AS POLICE IN GAZA AND JERICHO WHAT WILL THEY BE ALLOWED TO DO AND NOT DO AND TO WHOM 
AND WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE LITERALLY 
HOW TO DETERMINE WHO CAN COME AND GO AND HOW BETWEEN ISRAEL AND GAZA AND JERICHO 
IN CAIRO MEANWHILE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN MINISTERS CONVENE TO OVERSEE WORKING COMMITTEES LIKE THE ONE IN 
THE MINISTERS DECLARED DECISIONS FOR JERICHO AND GAZA SHOULD BE WRAPPED UP IN EVEN LESS THAN THE PLANNED TWO MONTHS 
WE HAVE AGREED ON SOMETHING WHICH IS BOTH HISTORIC AND REALISTIC AND MATERIAL 
AND WE SHOULD NOT SPARE TO SHOW TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT WE WERE MEANING REALLY TO CREATE A NEW REALITY FOR THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE 
THIS IS OUR INTENTIONS AND WE SHALL HANDLE IT 
IT IS NOT COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT IT IS A HISTORIC AGREEMENT 
IN THAT HISTORY MUST BE MADE PRACTICAL FOR GAZA AND JERICHO HARD BY HORDES OF SUN WORSHIPERS WHO'VE SLIPPED THE REAL WORLD FOR A FEW PRECIOUS DAYS LEAVING BEHIND THOSE UNFORESEEN COMPLICATIONS THAT HAVE A WAY OF REVISING EVEN THE BEST LAID PLANS 
AFTER THE CAMP DAVID AGREEMENTS OF NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE ISRAEL AND EGYPT COULDN'T AGREE ON WHAT TO DO WITH ONE PLACE 
THEY ENDED UP ARGUING ABOUT IT FOR TEN YEARS 
NEGOTIATORS HERE HOPE THAT'S NOT AN OMEN FOR WHAT THEY HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH IN TWO MONTHS
