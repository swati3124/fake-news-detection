IS PICKING UP THE PIECES OF HER LIFE FOR A SECOND TIME 
AN JET BOMBED HER HOME THE NIGHT BEFORE 
THE FAMILY HAD BEEN UPROOTED ONCE BEFORE AND FLED THE CAPITAL WHEN THE DISPUTE OVER KARABAKH FIRST ERUPTED 
FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE BOMBING HERE IN HER HUSBAND DREAMED IT MIGHT HAPPEN AND MOVED HER AND THE CHILDREN INTO A NEARBY VILLAGE 
AS BAD AS THINGS WERE WE NEVER IMAGINED THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING WHILE CHILDREN SLEPT IN THEIR BEDS THAT SUCH THINGS COULD FALL OUT OF THE SKY 
UNDER THAT RUBBLE WAS THE FAMILY BEDROOM 
WE WEREN'T HOME 
I LOOK AT THAT I SEE THAT AND I THANK GREAT GOD THAT HE SAVED US 
GIVEN THE DESTRUCTION AND CARNAGE IN KARABAKH IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE OPTIMISM OF THE ARMENIAN PRESIDENT 
OF COURSE IF YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY OUR ARMENIAN FATE APPEARS TRAGIC BUT YOU MUST LOOK TO THE FUTURE 
CERTAINLY OUR PRESENT IS IN NO WAY ANALOGOUS TO OUR PAST 
THAT PAST INCLUDES THE TURKS IN HAVING TAKEN AWAY MUCH THAT WAS TRADITIONALLY ARMENIAN TERRITORY 
THAT'S MOUNT SYMBOL OF THE ARMENIAN NATION 
IT SITS IN TURKEY AND THE ARMENIANS DON'T HAVE THE FORCE TO TAKE IT BACK 
BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION LIES KARABAKH INSIDE MODERN DAY AZERBAIJAN AND THE GOVERNMENT FIGURES THOSE TURKS DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO HOLD ONTO TO THAT PART OF THE ARMENIAN HOMELAND 
BUT IN ATTEMPTING TO REGAIN KARABAKH THE ARMENIANS HAVE NEARLY DESTROYED THEIR OWN ECONOMY 
THE RAIL YARDS ARE SILENT IN THEY WERE BUSY BEFORE THE WAR TRANSPORTING GOODS THROUGH AZERBAIJAN 
NOT THE LINES ARE 
THIS NUCLEAR REACTOR NOT FAR OUTSIDE WAS SHUT DOWN A YEAR AGO 
THE PEOPLE PRESIDENT TER AT THE HEAD FEARED ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE COULD CAUSE A NUCLEAR DISASTER 
IT MAY SOON REOPEN 
MUCH OF THE COUNTRY GOES WITHOUT ELECTRICITY NOW FOR LONG PERIODS 
IRONIC THAT THE SAME SORT OF PRAGMATISM THAT LED THE SOVIETS TO BUILD THE PLANT HERE IN THE FIRST IS NOW PUSHING THE INDEPENDENT ARMENIANS TO OPEN IT 
IT'S BEEN STAFFED THROUGHOUT THE CLOSING WORKERS PAID BUT NOT LABORING 
BUT FOR REFUGEES LIKE THE WAR MUST GO ON TO SAVE KARABAKH 
THE FIGHT SHE SAYS IS WORTH THE SUFFERING 
OF COURSE IT IS OF COURSE 
IT WAS ALL STARTED BY THE 
THE ARMENIANS RAISED THEIR HANDS TO VOTE THE RAISED AND AXES OVER OUR HEADS OVER THE HEADS OF CHILDREN 
THAT'S NOT RIGHT 
BUT AT RISK IN THIS HORRENDOUS INTRACTABLE FEUD IS A WHOLE GENERATION OF YOUNGSTERS
