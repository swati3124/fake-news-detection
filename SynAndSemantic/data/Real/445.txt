WELL SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN ARTHUR LEVITT TODAY TOOK HIS ARGUMENTS TO THE HOUSE SAYING THE SENATE BY REFUSING TO PASS A BILL TO FUND THE S. E. C. IS COSTING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND LEVITT SAYS THE LOSS OF FILING FEES FROM BIG CORPORATIONS WILL HIT TEN MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF THIS WEEK 
MYRON KANDEL JOINS ME NOW AND HE IS REALLY STEAMED AT WHAT HE CALLS THE SENATE STUPIDITY 
STRONG WORDS MYRON 
NOT STRONG ENOUGH LOU 
NOT ONLY ARE THOSE IN THE U. S. SENATE UP THE WORK OF THE S. E. C. BUT THEY'RE NOW TAKING MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKETS 
THAT'S BECAUSE BY BLOCKING S. E. C. FUNDING THEY'RE COSTING THE U. S. TREASURY MEANING EVENTUALLY ALL OF US TAXPAYERS BIG BUCKS 
S. E. C. CHAIRMAN ARTHUR LEVITT TELLS ME THAT YESTERDAY ALONE THE LOST FEES TOTALED FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS 
IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED BUT STICK WITH ME 
THE FUNDING BILL FOR LAST YEAR RAISED THE FEE FOR FILING NEW SECURITIES ISSUES TO ONE TWENTY NINTH OF ONE PERCENT 
BUT WITHOUT A NEW BILL THE FEE TO THE OLD ONE FIFTY TH OF ONE PERCENT AS OF MONDAY 
SMALL POTATOES 
NO WAY 
NOBODY WANTS TO PAY MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO SO COMPANIES ARE RUSHING TO REGISTER SECURITIES AT THE LOWER RATE 
IS IT WORTH THE RUSH 
CHRYSLER FINANCIAL REGISTERED EIGHTEEN BILLION WORTH AND SAVED A NEAT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS 
ITS SAVINGS OUR LOSS 
WHY COULDN'T THE S. E. C. JUST HOLD OFF APPROVALS UNTIL THE OLD FEES WERE BACK IN PLACE 
I RAISED THAT QUESTION WITH LEVITT WHO RESPONDED THE LAST THING I WOULD EVER DO HE SAID IS TAMPER WITH A CAPITAL FORMATION SYSTEM THAT'S SUCH A VITAL CORNERSTONE OF OUR UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S SOMETHING MEMBERS OF THE U. S. SENATE DON'T SEEM TO WORRY ABOUT 
SHAME ON THEM LOU 
ANY SIGN OF A QUICK RESOLUTION 
NUMBER
