CHAIRMAN MAO ONCE WROTE A REVOLUTION IS NOT A TEA PARTY 
IT IS AN ACT OF VIOLENCE 
TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE SYMBOLS OF MAO'S COMMUNIST REVOLUTION STILL DOMINATE CHINA'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THE COUNTRY HIS SUCCESSORS DEFIANTLY HAILED AS THE LAST TRUE OF SOCIALISM IS UNDERGOING A NON VIOLENT REVOLUTION PERHAPS MORE PROFOUND THAN THAT WHICH MAO HIMSELF INSPIRED 
IN THE VANGUARD OF THIS REVOLUTION CARRYING NOT A GUN BUT A PORTABLE TELEPHONE IS TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD BING 
BING IS A PRIVATE ENTREPRENEUR A NEW BREED OF CHINESE STYLE CAPITALIST AND DEALING TO DRUM UP BUSINESS FOR HIS CHAIN OF CLOTHING STORES IN BEIJING 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS GETTING THE DEAL DONE 
CHINA HAS ONE POINT TWO BILLION PEOPLE 
THERE IS NO LIMIT TO HOW MUCH MONEY I CAN MAKE 
SUCCESS HASN'T COME EASILY TO BING 
MR. WHEN I FIRST STARTED PEOPLE LOOKED DOWN ON ME BUT PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN CAN HELP FILL THE HOLES IN A STATE RUN ECONOMY 
BACK THEN GOVERNMENT RUN STORES ONLY SOLD CLOTHES IN BLUE GREEN AND GRAY SO WHEN I WENT INTO BUSINESS I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH COMPETITION 
TODAY BING RUNS FIVE STORES IN BEIJING 
HE HAS AMBITIOUS EXPANSION PLANS 
HE IS GETTING RICH AND ALL ACROSS CHINA THERE ARE MILLIONS MORE LIKE HIM 
DESPITE CRACKDOWN IN TIANANMEN SQUARE DESPITE THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM ALMOST EVERYWHERE ELSE INDEED IN PART BECAUSE OF IT CHINA'S PARAMOUNT LEADER DENG XIAOPING HAS SOUGHT NOT TO STIFLE BUT TO ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE MARKET ORIENTED REFORMS HERE 
WE SAY IN CHINA WE NEED TO LIBERATE OUR THINKING 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN 
IT MEANS ESCAPING FROM A PLANNED ECONOMY AND NO LONGER USING MARXIST THEORIES 
NOWHERE HAVE THE RESULTS BEEN MORE STRIKING THAN ON THE CHINA COAST THE ORIGINAL LABORATORY FOR THE COUNTRY'S EXPERIMENT WITH CAPITALIST TYPE MECHANISMS A DOZEN YEARS AGO 
TODAY THIS AREA OF CHINA HAS THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY ON EARTH ITS SUCCESSES AND PROBLEMS MIRRORING THOSE OF ITS CAPITALIST NEIGHBORS TAIWAN AND HONG KONG 
FREED FROM THE MARXIST THE PROVINCES OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN CHINA ARE NOW HOME TO TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT 
THEY PRODUCE A HUGE PROPORTION OF THE WORLD'S TOYS CLOTHES SHOES AND OTHER GOODS 
THEY HOST CHINA'S TWO STOCK MARKETS WHICH HAVE BEEN DRAWING FUNDS FROM INVESTORS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY AND IN A NATION WHERE OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS YEAR IS PROJECTED TO BE AN ASTONISHING TWELVE PERCENT THEIR CITIZENS PEOPLE LIKE ENGINEER ZHANG ENJOY CHINA'S HIGHEST STANDARD OF LIVING 
I HAVE A T. V. A V. C. R. A STEREO AND A COMPACT DISC PLAYER 
WE HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY TO SPEND 
OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS MUCH BETTER 
THE ECONOMIC BOOM HAS HARDLY BEEN WITHOUT PROBLEMS 
IN AUGUST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF APPLICATIONS TO BUY SHARES 
THE RIOT WAS PART OF AN EPIDEMIC OF SMUGGLING AND CORRUPTION WHICH HAS UNDERMINED ATTEMPTS TO A MARKET STYLE SYSTEM 
THAT'S NOT ALL 
THERE ARE PEDDLERS OPENLY SELLING MADE IN TAIWAN PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO TAPES 
THERE ARE REGULAR ROUND UPS OF THE THOUSANDS OF PROSTITUTES OFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO WEALTHY LOCAL CHINESE AND VISITING BUSINESSMEN 
THERE ARE DRUG ADDICTS AND AIDS CARRIERS 
NONETHELESS EARLIER THIS YEAR DENG XIAOPING EMERGED FROM THE INTO WHICH HE RETIRED SHORTLY AFTER THE TIANANMEN SQUARE CRACKDOWN AND MADE A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED TOUR OF SOUTHERN CHINA 
HIS MESSAGE CAPITALISM IS OKAY 
HIS GOAL THE FATE OF SOVIET COMMUNISM VERY MUCH ON HIS MIND TO USE CAPITALISM TO SAVE THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY 
WE WILL USE MANY PARTS OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM 
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE TO USE AND WE WILL USE THEM 
THIS IS TRUE SOCIALISM 
WHATEVER THE LABEL DENG WAS TAKING A CAREFULLY CALCULATED RISK 
THE CHINESE LEADERS ARE GAMBLING THAT IF THEY GIVE THE CHINESE CITIZENS ENOUGH TO EAT AND ENOUGH GOOD LIVING THAT THEY WON'T DEMAND POLITICAL FREEDOM 
FOR NOW THAT GAMBLE SEEMS TO BE PAYING OFF 
PEOPLE LIKE BING ARE FAR TOO BUSY GETTING RICH TO WORRY ABOUT POLITICS 
MR. I JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO BUSINESSMEN 
MAKING MONEY THAT'S MY GOAL 
BUT IN A NATION WHERE BARELY A DECADE AGO REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY WAS EVERYTHING THAT ATTITUDE ITSELF REPRESENTS A PROFOUND CHANGE 
ECONOMIC REFORM IS THE WAY FOR THE AS A SUBVERSIVE ASSAULT AGAINST THEIR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN A SINGLE PARTY IDEOLOGICAL TYPE OF GOVERNMENT 
THIS IS THE BEIJING SKATEBOARD CLUB THE FIRST AND ONLY SUCH ORGANIZATION IN CHINA COMPOSED OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY IS THE LAST THING ON THEIR MINDS 
I SLEEP ALL MORNING 
THEN I GO OUT AND SKATE 
MY WORK IS 
MANY OF BEIJING'S GATHER AT THIS SHOP WHERE SPEND UP TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS U. S. ON IMPORTED AMERICAN AND WHERE THE MANAGER HAS BUT ONE THING ON HIS MIND 
WE REALLY DIG THOSE AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL 
THIS WAS NOT WHAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE DEMOCRACY MARCHERS HAD IN MIND WHEN THEY USED THE TERM TAKING TO THE STREETS BUT EVEN TIANANMEN SQUARE VETERANS AGREE THESE KINDS OF CHANGES IN ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR ARE HAVING A REVOLUTIONARY IMPACT 
ECONOMIC REFORMS RESULT IN RISING LIVING STANDARDS 
PEOPLE WILL NO LONGER BE CONCERNED WITH JUST EATING BETTER AND DRESSING BETTER 
IT'S INEVITABLE THEY'LL WANT DEMOCRACY 
ALREADY IT IS CLEAR THAT ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION HAS REMOVED THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM DAY TO DAY CONTROL OVER THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF ORDINARY CHINESE AND WITH THE BOOM ALONG THE CHINA COAST GIVEN THE MOST REFORM ORIENTED PROVINCES AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FREEDOM TO MANAGE THEIR AFFAIRS INDEPENDENT OF THE ONCE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING 
YOU CAN'T COME TO CHINA AND NOT SEE THE PROCESS OF POLITICAL CHANGE ALREADY TAKING PLACE 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU NO LONGER HAVE A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THAT ESSENTIALLY HAS TIGHT CONTROL OVER THE COUNTRY 
IN TYPICALLY CHINESE FASHION EVEN THE MOST ARDENT REFORMERS ARE RELUCTANT TO ADMIT PUBLICLY THAT CHINA FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES ABANDONING SOCIALISM BUT CHAIRMAN MAO'S LEGACY IS UNQUESTIONABLY BEING AWAY 
IT HAS NOT HOWEVER ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
