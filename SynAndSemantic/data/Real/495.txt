AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING IN A LITTLE OVER THREE HOURS PRESIDENT CLINTON PRESENTS CONGRESS TO HIS PROPOSED NINETEEN NINETY SIX FEDERAL BUDGET 
BUT THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT CONGRESS MR. CLINTON IS DEALING WITH SINCE LAST ELECTION 
JOINING US TO DISCUSS THE BUDGET AND OTHER ISSUES REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN HALEY BARBOUR AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY STRATEGIST PAUL BEGALA 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH 
GOOD MORNING BOB 
MORNING 
MR. BEGALA LET ME TURN TO YOU FIRST AND ASK YOU WHY KNOWING THE REPUBLICANS WERE GOING AFTER THE BUDGET WITH A MEAT AXE DID THE PRESIDENT GO AFTER IT WITH A SCALPEL 
WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION BOB 
THIS PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY CUT THE BUDGET BY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLION WITHOUT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTE 
THIS BUDGET CONTINUES THAT WORK CUTTING THE BUDGET AGAIN BY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOLLAR BILLION 
THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET TODAY CUTS THE DEFICIT CUTS SPENDING AND CUTS TAXES FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS 
BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO IS JUST AS IMPORTANT 
IT DOES NOT CUT MEDICARE IN ORDER TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON THE VERY RICH 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MR. PARTY AND THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO DO 
AS SOON AS THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON THIS BUDGET THEY'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT AFTER MEDICARE 
AND THIS PRESIDENT CUTS THE DEFICIT WITHOUT CUTTING INTO MEDICARE SO THAT SO THAT THE REPUBLICANS WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE THEIR CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUTS TO THE VERY RICH 
ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING TO DO THAT MR. BARBOUR 
OF COURSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS BOB IN THIS BUDGET THE DEFICIT'S GOING TO GO UP 
AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLION FOR THE NEXT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS 
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE 
BUT I WANT JUST START OFF BY SAYING WE DO NOT DISMISS THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET OUT OF HAND 
IT'S NOT DEAD ON ARRIVAL AS THEY USED TO SAY ABOUT GEORGE BUSH'S BUDGET OR RONALD REAGAN'S BUDGET WHEN IT WENT BEFORE THE DEMOCRAT CONGRESS 
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION THAT IT DESERVES 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THOUGH EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT IT DOESN'T DO ENOUGH 
WE'LL WE'RE DETERMINED TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWO 
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S BUDGET DOES NOT DO THAT 
WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING IN FACT PRESIDENT CLINTON NOT ONLY DIDN'T BITE THE BULLET HE DIDN'T EVEN BITE THE B. B. 
HOW ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE MR. BARBOUR 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TOSSED THAT BALL IN YOUR COURT NOW 
WELL PRESIDENT CLINTON WANTS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS AN HOUR 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING THAT DESTROYS JOBS OR IS ANTI YOUNG OR ANTI POOR 
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE LAST TIME THAT WE RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE IT DID HURT JOBS PARTICULARLY AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE WHOSE WAGES WENT WHOSE JOB LOSS WENT UP UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WENT UP THIRTY PERCENT 
THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE WHEN IT WAS CONTROLLED BY THE DEMOCRATS SAID A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD COST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS 
AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE 
SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO EARN THE MINIMUM WAGE ARE PART TIME WORKERS 
A MILLION OF THEM ARE TEENAGERS WHO COME FROM FAMILIES THAT HAVE FAMILY INCOME OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
ONLY EIGHT PERCENT OF OF HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD EARNED A MINIMUM WAGE AND MANY OF THEM ARE NOT POOR 
SO THERE IS NO CASE FOR THIS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE JOB LOSS AND HOW ANTI SMALL BUSINESS IT IS THE CASE AGAINST IT IS OVERWHELMING 
MR. BEGALA DO YOU EXPECT ANY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE TO ACTUALLY SURVIVE CONGRESS 
WELL I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT ONE 
THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER WHETHER OR NOT THEY DELIVER ONE 
YOU CAN'T RAISE A FAMILY ON THE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS OR NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE PROVIDES 
IT I I CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH THOUGH BOB TO HEAR HALEY BARBOUR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW WITH NEW FOUND WORDS ABOUT TEENAGERS AND POOR PEOPLE AND MINORITIES 
THIS IS A PARTY THE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE GOING TO TRY TO GO AFTER STUDENT LOANS THAT HELP YOUNG PEOPLE TRY TO GO AFTER MEDICARE THAT HELPS ELDERLY PEOPLE TRY TO GO AFTER PEOPLE THAT CAN RAISE PEOPLE UP OUT OF POVERTY AND INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND HELP TO RAISE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS UP INTO PROSPERITY 
THAT'S THE TARGET THAT THEY HAVE SET IN THEIR BUDGET 
IT'S WHY THEY OPPOSE A MINIMUM WAGE WHICH IS JUST FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS FOR WORKING PEOPLE 
AND YET THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO CUT MEDICARE IN ORDER TO GIVE A TAX BREAK TO THE VERY RICH 
LET'S TALK ABOUT 
LET ME JUST MENTION BOB 
ALL RIGHT BRIEFLY 
BILL CLINTON'S BUDGET CUT MEDICARE FIFTY SIX DOLLAR BILLION TWO YEARS AGO 
IN THE CLINTON TAX BILL MEDICARE WAS CUT FIFTY SIX DOLLAR BILLION 
ALL THIS IDEA THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO CUT MEDICARE YOU KNOW LET'S GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT ABOUT WHO'S ALREADY CUT MEDICARE 
WITHOUT AS PAUL SAID WITHOUT ONE SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTING FOR IT 
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT FIRST THE MEDICARE CUTS IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET WERE FIFTY SIX DOLLAR BILLION OF CUTS ON PROVIDERS THAT IS THE PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS THAT PROVIDE IT 
AND THAT IS ENOUGH CUTS ALREADY 
IF YOU GO BEYOND THAT YOU START TO CUT SENIOR CITIZENS 
I WANT TO ASK THE CHAIRMAN HERE IF HE'LL GIVE A PLEDGE THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL NOT CUT MEDICARE ANY FARTHER 
WELL THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS PRESIDENT CLINTON WHO WHO HIMSELF APPOINTED AN ENTITLEMENTS COMMISSION TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS THE FACT THAT MEDICARE IS GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY AND HE APPOINTED A COMMISSION WHICH MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO HIM BUT HE JUST IGNORED HIM 
HE WON'T STAND UP AND EVEN SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS HIS OWN COMMISSION SAID HAD TO BE TENDED TO 
HE AND SO BUT WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE AND WHO'S JUST GOING TO TAKE THE POLITICAL EASY WAY OUT 
O. K. WELL I'D LIKE TO RUN DOWN THAT TRAIL FURTHER BUT BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS LET'S TURN TO A COUPLE OF ISSUES 
DOCTOR HENRY FOSTER THE PRESIDENT'S CHOICE TO BE SURGEON GENERAL MR. BARBOUR TWO KEY REPUBLICANS BOTH DOLE AND LOTT SAY IT IS IN TROUBLE 
IS HE GOING TO GET THROUGH CONGRESS 
WELL I THINK A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON HIS TESTIMONY 
AND I DON'T WANT TO PREJUDGE HIM BUT HE HAS BEEN A ON THE BOARD OF A GROUP THAT ADVOCATED GIVING CONDOMS TO ALL PEOPLE ALL CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS TO TEACH TO PEOPLE IN KINDERGARTEN 
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF HE SHARES THOSE VIEWS OR NOT 
BUT CERTAINLY THAT RAISES RED FLAGS 
THE QUESTION OF ABORTION I MEAN DOES IS HE FOR ABORTION ON DEMAND AT ANY TIME AND PREGNANCY FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON 
OR DOES HE FAVOR SOME LIMITATIONS 
THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO COME OUT OF THESE HEARINGS 
PAUL BEGALA THE REPUBLICANS ARE APPARENTLY CONSIDERING PULLING BACK BACKING OFF AT LEAST SOME AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS 
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT 
WE'LL LET THE REPUBLICANS STATE THEIR POSITIONS FOR THEMSELVES 
BOB I WANT TO JUMP IN TO DEFEND THE RECORD OF DOCTOR FOSTER 
HE HAS FOR EXAMPLE BEEN ENDORSED BY BILL WHO IS A NEW REPUBLICAN SENATOR VERY CONSERVATIVE 
HE'S THE SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE 
HE HAS BEEN A PHYSICIAN BY TRAINING AND HE HAS WORKED WITH DOCTOR FOSTER AND HE ENDORSES HIM 
LAMAR ALEXANDER WHO VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT BUT WAS THE GOVERNOR OF WHICH IS WHERE DOCTOR FOSTER'S FROM HE HAS ENDORSED THIS MAN 
THE GROUP THAT HE'S BEEN ON THE BOARD OF IS CALLED PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND IT WAS FOUNDED MANY YEARS AGO BY THE FATHER OF GEORGE BUSH 
SO I DON'T THINK EXACTLY THIS IS A RADICAL NOMINATION IT'S JUST THE REPUBLICANS AGAIN TRYING TO DIVIDE PEOPLE 
AND DOCTOR FOSTER'S A MAN WHO BUILT HIS CAREER ON DELIVERING BABIES BUT ALSO TRYING TO PREVENT TEENAGE PREGNANCY 
AND HE'S HAD REMARKABLE SUCCESS WITH THAT IN TENNESSEE AS EVEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS IN HIS STATE WILL TELL YOU 
ALL RIGHT MR. BARBOUR BEFORE YOU FOLKS GET AWAY I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT SENATOR STROM THURMOND 
REPORTS CIRCULATING NOW THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMS SERVICES COMMITTEE WHO IS NOW NINETY TWO YEARS OLD MAY NOT BE UP TO THE JOB 
THAT HE HAS APPARENTLY HAD SOME DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING IN SOME RECENT MEETINGS AND CONTEXTS 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HIS PROSPECTS FOR CONTINUING AS CHAIRMAN 
I WOULD SAY HIS PROSPECTS ARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BOB 
STROM A REMARKABLE MAN 
AND I I I HAPPEN TO BE WITH HIM ABOUT ONE ONCE A WEEK AT A LUNCHEON WHERE HE SPEAKS 
AND HE'S REMARKABLE 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING I HAVEN'T HEARD THESE REPORTS LET ME SAY THAT FIRST OF ALL AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO IT AT ALL 
I THINK SENATOR THURMOND WHO DID A SPECTACULAR JOB AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY PREVIOUSLY WILL DO JUST AS GOOD A JOB AS CHAIRMAN OF ARMED SERVICES
