I GUESS A LOT OF YOU ARE AWARE OF SOME OF THESE THE PROBLEMS THAT THE CABLE COMPANIES HAVE HAD 
CABLE COMPANIES NOW ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR SERVICES OR EQUIPMENT NOT REQUESTED BY YOU THE CUSTOMER 
THE F. C. C. MUST ENSURE REASONABLE PRICES FOR INSTALLATION AND EQUIPMENT 
SERVICE STANDARDS MUST BE SET TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST CHRONIC OUTAGES 
DO YOU EVER SIT THERE AND WATCH A TELEVISION SHOW AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CABLE GOES OFF FOR HOURS 
SOMETIMES A DAY OR SO 
PROTECT AGAINST BILLING REFUNDS SERVICE PROGRAMS 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN ALSO SET SOME ADDITIONAL STANDARDS 
LET'S GO TO YOUR PHONE CALLS 
PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN GET TO A LOT OF CALLS 
YOUR FIRST CALL IS FROM ILLINOIS 
HELLO 
ILLINOIS HELLO 
HELLO 
YES GO AHEAD 
THE REASON WHY I'M CALLING IS I THINK THAT WE'RE FORGETTING THE BASIC ISSUE HERE IS THAT CABLE SUBSCRIPTION IS A NOT A NECESSITY IT'S A LUXURY AND IF THE MARKET'S NOT GOING TO BEAR THE PRICE THEN SUBSCRIPTION COUNTS WOULD GO DOWN 
AND CABLE COMPANY SUBSCRIPTION COUNTS ARE GOING UP 
THEREFORE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE RATES AREN'T THAT OUTRAGEOUS AND IF PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE RATES THEN THEY JUST DON'T HAVE TO PAY IT 
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT 
AND LET ME ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CABLE RATE INCREASE HAS BEEN TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT SINCE THE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
NEARLY FIFTY SIX MILLION HOUSEHOLDS NOW HAVE CABLE AND SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WITH TELEVISION HAVE CABLE RIGHT NOW 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT NOT EVERYBODY IT IS A LUXURY NOT EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD IT AND IF THE RATES KEEP GOING UP PEOPLE WON'T 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
OUR NEXT CALL IS IN WASHINGTON 
HELLO 
HI BRIAN HOW ARE YOU DOING 
I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH MY CABLE 
I'VE HAD IT FOR MANY YEARS BUT I'M WONDERING WHY DO YOU HATE HOWARD STERN SO MUCH 
O. K. OUR NEXT CALL IS FROM KANSAS 
HELLO 
HI 
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THIS CABLE REGULATION BILL IS A REAL SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE CABLE INDUSTRY WHICH HAS REALLY ACHIEVED THIS WONDERFUL THING AGAINST ALL OF THE AGAINST ALL ODDS 
THE I'M A LIBERTARIAN AND I THINK THE LIBERTARIAN POSITION IS RIGHT 
THAT IS TO ELIMINATE REGULATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME ELIMINATE THE FRANCHISE RIGHTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE CREATED FOR THEMSELVES OUT OF THIN AIR 
THEN THERE WOULD BE NO EXCUSE FOR SAYING THAT THERE AREN'T OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPETITION 
BUT I THINK THE CABLE INDUSTRY IS REALLY DESERVES A PAT ON THE BACK FOR DOING A GREAT JOB AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL ONLY MAKE THINGS WORK 
O. K. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN WASHINGTON 
HELLO 
YES OH EXCUSE ME 
YES I WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR FIRST CALLER WHO SAID THAT CABLE IS JUST A LUXURY 
WHERE I LIVE AT WE ALL WE HAVE IS CABLE 
THERE ARE NO LOCAL BROADCAST STATIONS AND IF YOU WANT TO WATCH TELEVISION YOU MUST HAVE CABLE 
IF THIS BILL IS GOING TO CAUSE OUR CABLE RATES TO GO UP WE DON'T NEED IT BECAUSE WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT WHERE WE ARE NOW BECAUSE GET VERY LITTLE FOR WHAT WE PAY NOW ABOUT TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH FOR BASIC CABLE 
THAT'S RIDICULOUS 
WHAT PART OF WASHINGTON ARE YOU IN 
WASHINGTON UP IN THE FAR NORTH CORNER 
O. K. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CALL 
THANK YOU 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET BROADCAST TELEVISION OR SOME OF THE SIGNAL DOESN'T COME IN VERY CLEAR AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE IS CABLE 
IT'S A GOOD POINT 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN TEXAS 
HELLO 
HELLO 
HI 
BRIAN 
YES 
LOVE YOUR SHOW 
THANK YOU SIR 
HERE IN HOUSTON THE RATES HAVE GONE UP UNBELIEVABLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND I THINK THAT IT'S ABOUT TIME TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE RATES BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ON THE NEWS IN ANY TIME IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO AS FAR AS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THE OUTRAGEOUS RATES 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST CABLE COMPANIES AND WE HAVE NO ONE TO TURN TO AS FAR AS CONSUMERS 
GOOD POINT AND THAT'S WHAT THE MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS ARE TALKING ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY THIS APPARENTLY HAS PASSED 
WE THANK YOU 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN INDIANA 
HELLO 
HI 
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY IT'S A VICTORY FOR JOE AVERAGE AMERICA 
O. K. 
GOOD COMMENT 
THANK YOU 
LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALL IN CALIFORNIA 
HELLO 
YEAH I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY'S ADDRESSED HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WELL IT'S A GOOD POINT 
PRESIDENT 
HOW ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 
PRESIDENT BUSH 
PRESIDENT BUSH 
PRESIDENT BUSH SAYS THE BILL WOULD INCREASE YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENT 
HE SAYS THE LEGISLATION WOULD COST AMERICAN JOBS AND DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
NUMBER 
NO NO WAY 
O. K. 
IT'S GOING TO COST BIG GOVERNMENT THREE THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE F. C. C. A LOT MORE REGULATION LOT MORE AUDITS 
THE CABLE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO PASS THAT RIGHT ON TO US 
SO YOU SEE IT COMING NOT QUITE RIGHT AWAY BUT MAYBE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
ABSOLUTELY 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REBEL AGAIN ON IT 
IT'S JUST GOING TO MORE GOVERNMENT 
SO THE F. C. C. GETTING INVOLVED IS JUST GOING TO BOTCH THINGS UP 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
NO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BOTCH THINGS UP 
THEY'RE GOING TO DO THEIR JOB 
AND THEIR JOB IS TO ADMINISTER AND TO AUDIT AND TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CABLE RATES ARE GOING TO BE 
AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER FORCING THE CABLE COMPANIES TO DO AUDITS AND MAKING AND THAT THEIR RATES ARE FAIR 
O. K. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CALL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL OF YOU THAT WOULD TAKE THE TIME TO CALL US
