IT'S EASY TO ROMANTICIZE THE LIFE OF A WRITER 
TAKE DANIEL PINKWATER FOR EXAMPLE 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GET UP AND DRIVE TO AN OFFICE EVERY DAY 
HE JUST GETS OUT OF BED HAS A BREAKFAST AND THEN INTO THE NEXT ROOM TO WRITE 
IF HE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY THAT DAY GREAT 
IF NOT HE TAKES A WALK 
NOT BAD 
BUT PINKWATER TELLS US THE PRESSURE ON A WRITER CAN ACTUALLY BE TERRIBLE 
PROFESSOR GEORGE D. ROSE OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SENT ME E. MAIL TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS TIME I STOPPED AROUND AND WROTE SOMETHING REALLY SERIOUS 
YOU KNOW A BIG BOOK 
GEORGE IS ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS 
HE LOVES ME AND JUST WANTS TO BE MORE PROUD 
HE WANTS MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF UMBERTO AND TOM ROBBINS 
WE WERE EDUCATED TOGETHER AT A COLLEGE WHEREIN EVERY STUDENT WAS EXPECTED TO WRITE THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL OR DIE IN THE ATTEMPT 
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO GEORGE THAT I AM NOT EVEN TRYING TO WRITE THE GREAT AMERICAN PARAGRAPH 
BUT I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THE JOB I DID 
I WANT TO TRY AGAIN HERE 
IN NEW YORK AN ANTIQUE AND PICTURESQUE TOWN NOT FAR FROM WHERE I LIVE STANDS THE ARMS ADVERTISED AS THE OLDEST INN IN AMERICA AND RECENTLY WRITTEN UP AS ONE OF THE TEN BEST RESTAURANTS 
I HAVE EATEN THERE MANY A TIME AND IT'S REALLY GOOD 
ACROSS THE STREET IS ANOTHER RESTAURANT CALICO 
IT'S TINY 
THERE'S SPACE FOR JUST SIX TABLES AND A GLASS PASTRY CASE 
IT'S A CHARMING ROOM AND IT AFFORDS A VIEW OF THE STREET AND THE HANDSOME OLD INN 
A COUPLE RUNS IT 
HE COOKS 
SHE 
THE MENU IS SMALL 
ONE NIGHT I HAD THE PAN ROASTED BREAST OF DUCK WITH WILD RICE AND A CRANBERRY CHAMPAGNE SAUCE THAT I CAN'T QUIT THINKING ABOUT 
JILL HAD THE ROAST OF PORK INSERTED WITH HUDSON VALLEY APPLES AND SERVED WITH POTATO AND 
I JUDGE A MEAL BY WHAT IT DOES TO MY STATE OF MIND 
AFTER THAT VISIT TO CALICO OUR MOOD WAS TO SAY THE LEAST ELEVATED 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT PART OF OUR EUPHORIA RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE EXPERIENCE WOUND UP COSTING LESS THAN FORTY DOLLARS 
OF COURSE WE DIDN'T HAVE APPETIZERS 
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WITH CHEESE SERVED WITH A OF WILD MUSHROOMS OR THE STEAMED MANILA WITH INFUSED 
WE DID HAVE ASTONISHING FRENCH FOR DESSERT AND A PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE 
AFTER OUR MEAL WE STROLLED THE PERFECT STREETS OF TALKING QUIETLY FEELING PEACEFUL NOT BIG NOT PRESTIGIOUS OR ACCLAIMED JUST RIGHT 
GEORGE I CAN'T PROMISE I WILL EVER WRITE AN IMPORTANT BOOK 
BUT IF YOU'LL COME TO I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER
