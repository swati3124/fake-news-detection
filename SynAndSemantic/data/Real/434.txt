IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY COMING TO HAITI CAN BE SHOCKING 
BASICS THAT MANY TAKE FOR GRANTED SUCH AS COVERED SEWERS AND CLEAN WATER ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY 
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S RIGHT NOW GETTING THE HEALTH VOLUNTEER AGENCIES INTO THE COUNTRY BEING ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE SUPPLIES AND PROVISIONS TO THE POPULOUS 
I THINK THAT FOR PEOPLE I THINK THAT MY VISION IS THAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPEN MORE THESE HOSPITAL FOR THE COMMUNITY 
IF YOU ARE SEEING THE AREA WHERE ABOUT ONE MILLION PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE IS THE BIGGEST HOSPITAL IS PROBABLY THE ONLY FACILITY HEALTH FACILITY THAT THEY HAVE 
I AM A RELIGIOUS WOMAN AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT COME HERE STILL HAVE A LOT OF LIFE LEFT IN THEM 
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE REJECTED THEM AND SO WE MUST BE THEIR FAMILIES 
SO WE STAY HERE AND WE LOVE THEM AND WE LIVE AS A FAMILY 
I DON'T THINK WE CAN SEE THINGS TURN AROUND WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR EVEN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
IT WILL TAKE YEARS 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME THAT ANYONE SHOULD GIVE UP OR CALL IT A HOPELESS SITUATION
