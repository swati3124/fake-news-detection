WELCOME BACK 
ON INCOME TAX DAY TWO SENIOR CLINTON OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THE WAY TO FINANCE HEALTH CARE MIGHT BE A NATIONAL SALES TAX THE VAT OR VALUE ADDED TAX BUT OTHER TOP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOWNPLAYED THE LIKELIHOOD OF A VAT 
I THINK SOMEONE WAS CANDID AND SAID THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY OPTIONS THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED 
ARE THE WORKING GROUPS HAVE THEY EXAMINED THE POSSIBILITY OF A VAT 
YES THEY HAVE 
HAS IT BEEN PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT HAS HE MADE A DECISION 
NO HE HAS NOT 
REACTION ON CAPITOL HILL WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT VALUE ADDED OR SALES TAXES YOU'RE HURTING THE POOR PEOPLE AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
AT THE SAME TIME THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED COMPROMISE OF HIS ECONOMIC STIMULUS WAS REJECTED BY THE SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER 
IT COULDN'T BE WORSE TIMING 
WE'RE TRYING TO THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO TELL EVERYBODY WE NEED THIS STIMULUS PACKAGE AND THEN SOMEBODY DROPS A NEW TAX IDEA OUT THERE THAT'S GOT TO SCARE A LOT OF TAXPAYERS WHO ARE ALREADY FRIGHTENED BECAUSE OF THE OTHER BIG TAX PACKAGE 
MARK WHY IS BILL CLINTON FLOATING A VALUE ADDED TAX RIGHT NOW 
AL ENTERTAINMENT 
I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S DOING IT 
SURE THERE'S A COUPLE OF OBVIOUS REASONS ONE YOU TURN IT ON IT'S A SPIGOT FULL OF MONEY 
IT JUST PRODUCES A GREAT AMOUNT OF MONEY ONE HUNDRED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ONE ESTIMATE THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE CAME UP WITH 
EVEN IF YOU EXEMPTED FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HALF FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS JUST ABOUT THE PRICE AT LEAST A GOOD PART OF THE PRICE YOU NEED FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PLAN 
AL DANNY ROSTENKOWSKI THE CHAIRMAN OF THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IT'S A TAX THAT HITS NOT ON A FAIR BASIS IT HITS THE BOTTOM THE POOREST FIFTH OF AMERICANS 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME 
THE TOP FIFTH SITTING OVER HERE TO MY IMMEDIATE RIGHT IT WOULD TAKE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF HIS INCOME 
I THINK FOR ANY TAX TO WORK ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A DEMOCRATIC TAX IT'S SUCH A MAJOR CHANGE THERE HAS TO BE A SENSE OF FAIRNESS AND THAT'S MISSING 
I THINK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR FAR RIGHT MR. NOVAK 
MY FAR RIGHT EXCUSE ME 
BOB I WOULD THINK IF MARK'S RIGHT I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD LOVE THIS TAX 
YOU LOVE TAXES FOR THE POOR RATHER THAN WEALTHY PEOPLE 
IT IS 
AND ALSO IF IT WILL REPLACE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES AND CORPORATE TAXES WOULD YOU LIKE IT 
IT'S A TERRIBLE TAX AND IT'S NOT GOING TO REPLACE THE INCOME TAX AND CORPORATE GAIN TAX 
WE HAVE AN EMINENT MEMBER OF THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE 
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
THE TROUBLE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS IS THEY'RE UNREALISTIC 
THEY THINK THIS IS GOING TO GET THEM OFF THE HOOK FROM PAYING TAXES AND IT'S NOT 
THE BIG INDUSTRIAL AMERICAN INDUSTRIES ALSO THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A HELP FOR EXPORTS IT ISN'T 
WHAT IT'S REALLY GOING TO DO IT'S GOING IF IT CAME IN IT WOULD REALLY HURT ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT 
IT ISN'T SO BAD ON POOR PEOPLE AS IT IS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING BECAUSE WITH AN ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRM BECAUSE EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS OF A PRODUCT NOW GETS TAXED 
THIS IS JUST A TERRIBLE IDEA AND IT WAS DONNA SHALALA WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WASHINGTON ALICE RIVLIN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET BUREAU WHO SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WASHINGTON THEY JUST SEE ALL THOSE GREENBACKS AND GOT 
SANDY I THINK IT WAS LIKE WHEN THEY FLOATED THE COLA YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CLAMP DOWN ON COLA'S DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS 
I THINK IT WAS PUT OUT THERE SO WHAT THEY DO COME UP WITH WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO COME UP WITH WILL LOOK MORE REASONABLE 
I'M NOT SURE IT WAS A DELIBERATE TRIAL BALLOON 
A FEW MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS BEING CONSIDERED 
IT'S ONE OF NUMEROUS OPTIONS 
HERE'S THE DILEMMA IN A WORD 
THE CLINTONS ARE LEADING AN EFFORT FOR HEALTH REFORM 
WE NEED IT IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEED IT BADLY 
WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION UNINSURED 
IN ORDER TO CONTAIN COSTS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY IT'S BETTER TO GET EVERYBODY IN BUT IF YOU HAVE COST CONTAINMENT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK QUICKLY ENOUGH SO YOU RECAPTURE FROM THE SAVINGS ENOUGH TO SPREAD INSURANCE TO ALL THE UNINSURED 
SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT IN MY OWN VIEW I THINK THIS PROPOSAL WILL NOT SURVIVE 
AL GORE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN 
I THINK THERE'S NOT ONLY A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS THERE'S THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU CAN ADD A VERY SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL TAX AT THIS POINT EVEN FOR AS GOOD A CAUSE AS HEALTH CARE AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS YOU CAN'T DO IT 
THE EMPHASIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ON COST CONTAINMENT 
SO TO PARAPHRASE MARK THAT'S DEAD 
THAT'S RIGHT 
MONA BOB DOLE REJECTED THE STIMULUS THING 
BILL CLINTON IS UP IN PENNSYLVANIA TRYING TO PUT PRESSURE ON PEOPLE LIKE ARLEN SPECTER 
WILL THAT PRESSURE WORK ON ANY OF THOSE MODERATE REPUBLICANS FOR HIS ECONOMIC PACKAGE 
NO NO I DON'T THINK SO 
I THINK THAT BILL CLINTON HAS SUCCEEDED IN UNITING THE REPUBLICANS TO A REMARKABLE EXTENT AND REMINDING THEM OF WHAT IT IS THAT THEY OPPOSE 
BILL CLINTON BY PROPOSING THIS VAT AT LEAST FLOATING IT HAS SHOWN THAT HE BELIEVES THE TROUBLE WITH AMERICA IS THAT AMERICANS HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO TAKE MORE OF IT IN THE FORM OF B. T. U. TAXES INCOME TAXES AND NOW EVEN SALES TAXES WHICH IS WHAT A VAT IS A NATIONAL SALES TAX 
THEY ARE BY A LARGE DEGREE THE AMOUNT OF PATIENCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE WITH THIS AND IT COULD BE A POLITICAL KILLER 
IT'S NOT THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL 
TWO PEOPLE SAID IT'S BEING CONSIDERED BY A FIVE HUNDRED PERSON TASK FORCE 
WELL HE'S BACKING AWAY FROM IT NOW RIGHT 
HE DIDN'T PROPOSE IT 
SANDY I'LL GIVE YOU THAT NO DOUBT OF THAT BUT BOY THE LAST WEEK OR TWO THIS GUY BILL CLINTON WHO WAS MAGICAL JUST THREE WEEKS AGO LOOKS LIKE HE'S KIND OF BUMBLING LOOKS LIKE HE'S KIND OF BUMBLING IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE 
THIS WHOLE THING HASN'T BEEN HANDLED RIGHT 
IS THE MAGIC GONE 
I DON'T THINK THE MAGIC IS GONE 
I THINK IT'S HARD WORK TO GET THINGS DONE IN THIS COUNTRY 
PEOPLE WANTED CHANGE 
MY GUESS IS THERE WILL BE A STIMULUS PACKAGE 
I THINK PEOPLE REALIZE WE NEED TO STIMULATE JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE NEED TO TRY TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY RIGHT AWAY 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM SANDY IS WITH YOUR PRESIDENT AND THAT'S WHY HE'S 
HE'S YOURS TOO 
THE TROUBLE WITH AL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS 
HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT ALL THE GROWTH THAT YOU NEED IN THIS COUNTRY CAN BE GENERATED BY THE GOVERNMENT YOU CAN DO IT BY SPENDING BY PUTTING THESE SILLY MAKE WORK PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO TAX AND TAX AND TAX AND TAX 
THE STIMULUS PACKAGE GOES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR LIKE CONSTRUCTION JOBS 
LET'S LET 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
WHICH DON'T COME ON LINE FOR TWO YEARS 
THE CRITICISM 
MARK I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCURATE BUT 
NO IT ISN'T ACCURATE 
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THIS GUY IS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO CLINTON'S LASER BEAM APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY 
IT'S GOTTEN DISTRACTED 
IT'S BEEN OFF 
THERE WAS A BEAM IN HIS EYE 
I DON'T KNOW 
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT AL 
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT FROM BROTHER NOVAK 
I MEAN THE CRITICISM OF BILL CLINTON DURING THE CAMPAIGN WAS HE WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE BIG BUSINESS INTERESTS 
DID I SAY THAT 
DID I EVER SAY THAT 
WHEN DID YOU EVER 
IN ARKANSAS THE CHICKEN 
HEAR ME SAY THAT 
PRO BUSINESS DEMOCRAT 
LET'S SAY ONE THING HE GETS BACK ON MESSAGE AND HE BETTER DO IT IN A HURRY HE'LL PREVAIL
