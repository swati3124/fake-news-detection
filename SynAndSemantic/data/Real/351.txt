UNPRECEDENTED ELECTIONS MAY TOPPLE ONE OF AFRICA'S LAST DICTATORS 
THE NATION OF MALAWI IS HOLDING ITS FIRST DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS TODAY 
VOTERS ARE EXPECTED TO UNSEAT THEIR PRESIDENT FOR LIFE HASTINGS 
HELLO EVERYONE I'M BRIAN ANDREWS CASSANDRA HENDERSON IS ON ASSIGNMENT 
THIS IS A SPECIAL EDITION OF C. N. N. NEWSROOM 
MALAWI IS IN SOUTHEASTERN AFRICA 
IT IS A POOR NATION 
ON AVERAGE CITIZENS EARN JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR 
THE LAND HAS BEEN INHABITED BY SPEAKING PEOPLES FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE IT WAS MADE A BRITISH COLONY CALLED THE OF 
FOLLOWING A FREEDOM MOVEMENT BY HASTINGS THE BECAME INDEPENDENT IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
THE NAME WAS CHANGED TO MALAWI FROM THE MALAWI KINGDOM ESTABLISHED DURING THE FIFTEEN HUNDREDS 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY PROCLAIMED HIMSELF PRESIDENT FOR LIFE HOWEVER A REFERENDUM SHOWED THAT A MAJORITY OF VOTERS WANTED TO END ONE PARTY RULE 
WAS FORCED TO CALL ELECTIONS 
TODAY EIGHT PARTIES ARE GOING FOR ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN SEATS IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENCY 
BOB COEN HAS MORE ON THE HISTORIC MALAWI ELECTIONS 
ELECTION FEVER IS SWEEPING ACROSS THE SMALL AFRICAN COUNTRY OF MALAWI AS ITS PEOPLE PREPARE FOR THEIR FIRST EVER FREE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS 
OVERSHADOWED BY THE HISTORIC EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA THE CHANGES HERE ARE JUST AS SIGNIFICANT 
ARE NOT SEEKING CHANGE FROM WHITE DOMINATION BUT ONE OF THE CONTINENTS MOST OPPRESSIVE DICTATORS 
THE WORLD'S OLDEST LIVING RULER NINETY SIX YEAR OLD PRESIDENT DECLARING HIMSELF PRESIDENT FOR LIFE AFTER LEADING HIS COUNTRY TO INDEPENDENCE THIRTY YEARS AGO HE AND HIS MALAWI CONGRESS PARTY HAVE RULED MALAWI WITH AN IRON FIST 
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF DISAPPEARANCES AND KILLINGS IN THIS COUNTRY 
THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT 
WE WERE DEPRIVED OF SO MANY THINGS 
BOWING DOWN TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AND INTERNAL DESCENT PRESIDENT CONCEDED TO HOLDING THE FREE ELECTIONS FOLLOWING LAST YEAR'S REFERENDUM 
AFTER DECADES OF LIVING IN FEAR PEOPLE ARE NOW FREE TO SPEAK OPENLY 
THERE IS A FREE PRESS AND A TANGIBLE FEELING OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE ELECTIONS 
WHAT WE NEED YOU KNOW IS JUST A FREE COUNTRY FREE DEMOCRACY 
THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR ONE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A GOVERNMENT THAT WE WANT 
NOW HAVE EIGHT POLITICAL PARTIES TO CHOOSE FROM 
AND THE CAMPAIGNING FROM THE CITIES AND THE COUNTRYSIDE HAS BEEN GREETED WITH THE NEW FOUNDED ENTHUSIASM FOR POLITICS 
ALTHOUGH NEARING ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRESIDENT IS RUNNING AS HIS RULING PARTY'S CANDIDATE 
BUT HE HAS BEEN SEEN LESS AND LESS IN PUBLIC SINCE UNDERGOING BRAIN SURGERY LAST YEAR FAILING TO TURN UP AT SEVERAL CAMPAIGN EVENTS 
HE HAS BEEN CALLED THE INVISIBLE CANDIDATE OF THIS ELECTION 
AND ALTHOUGH TIME MAY BE FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH PRESIDENT HIS RULING PARTY IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE WITH OR WITHOUT HIM 
MEANWHILE THE OPPOSITION PARTIES RATHER THAN DEAL WITH REAL ISSUES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR CHANGE 
THERE HAS BEEN ONE PARTY FOR STATE FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS 
A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS BEEN VERY OPPRESSIVE VERY AND IT WAS NECESSARY THAT CHANGE COME ABOUT 
BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE CANNOT READ OR WRITE THE HOLDING OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT 
THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN MARKED BY INCIDENTS OF INTIMIDATION SUCH AS THE USE BY THE RULING PARTY OF TRADITIONAL DANCES WHO ARE MUCH FEARED FOR THEIR MAGICAL POWERS 
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION REAL CHANGE FOR A COUNTRY WITH NO EXPERIENCE OF DEMOCRACY WILL NOT BE EASY 
MANY ARE LOOKING TO EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA AS AN EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW 
MY PRAYER IS THAT IF THE COULD HAVE THE SPIRIT THE SOUTH AFRICANS HAVE ADOPTED TO FAR OF ACCEPTING EACH OTHER AND TO LIVE TOGETHER AND TO WORK TOGETHER IN A THEN THE RESULTS IN THIS COUNTRY WILL BE GREAT AND WE WILL BE PROSPEROUS 
FINALLY MALAWI SEEMS READY FOR THE DAWNING OF A NEW DEMOCRATIC ERA AND THE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH IT
