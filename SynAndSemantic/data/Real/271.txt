WELCOME BACK TO DIPLOMATIC LICENSE 
WHEN IMPORTANT DIGNITARIES ARRIVE AT THE UNITED NATIONS THERE COULD BE A MOTORCADE A HIGH LEVEL AT THE DOOR AND A LOT OF FANFARE 
OUR NEXT GUEST DIDN'T RECEIVE MUCH OF ANYTHING WHEN HE ARRIVED FOR A MEETING THERE THIS WEEK BUT DOCTOR LUC IS PERHAPS HE'S DUE MORE THAN MOST U. N. VISITORS 
HE IS CREDITED WITH DISCOVERING THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS 
DOCTOR WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM 
THANK YOU 
HAS THE U. N. DONE ENOUGH REGARDING AIDS 
WELL SOME UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE A LOT 
FOR EXAMPLE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS STARTED VERY SOON AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THIS NEW DISEASE AND THE VIRUS TO DO SOMETHING 
BUT I THINK NOW THE AIDS IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM 
THERE ARE SOCIAL ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY IN POOR COUNTRIES 
SO I THINK NOW THE U. N. SHOULD BE MORE INVOLVED THAN IT WAS BEFORE 
AFSANE 
DOCTOR COULD YOU EXPLAIN MORE 
I THINK FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT AIDS IS NO LONGER JUST THE MEDICAL PROBLEM 
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
YES 
SINCE THERE IS NO MEDICAL SOLUTION WE HAVE TO BE VERY FRANK NOW DESPITE ALL THE VERY IMPORTANT EFFORTS IN RESEARCH THE MASTER WORD IS PREVENTION EDUCATION 
SO WE HAVE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE HOW TO INFORM THEM HOW AIDS IS TRANSMITTED AND NOT TRANSMITTED 
AND THIS HAS TO BE DONE OF COURSE ACCORDING TO THE CULTURAL CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRIES 
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT IN AFRICA IN EUROPE YOU KNOW THE STATES IN EASTERN ASIA FOR INSTANCE 
BUT SINCE THE SITUATION IS SO DRAMATIC NOW THIS PREVENTION HAS NOT BEEN WORKING VERY WELL IN MANY COUNTRIES SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED 
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PERHAPS DOZENS OF MILLIONS INFECTED IN THE WORLD MOSTLY IN AFRICA MOSTLY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA NOW AND THOSE PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY HAVE AIDS IN THE COMING YEARS SO THEY WILL DISAPPEAR 
THERE WAS AN AIDS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK IN AFRICA 
THE PROBLEM IS THE WORST THERE RIGHT 
THEIR PROBLEM IS ONE OF THE WORST YES 
WHAT CAN THE U. N. DO 
IS THE U. N. DOING ENOUGH 
I MEAN WHY DID YOU COME TO THE U. N. THIS WEEK 
I THINK FOR INSTANCE EDUCATION SHOULD BE DONE IN A MUCH STRONGER WAY AND WHAT I AM PROPOSING NOW ACTUALLY IS TO TRY TO COORDINATE THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS OF THE U. N. ORGANIZATIONS THE WHO AND EVEN THE U. N. AS A WHOLE TO TRY TO SEND SOME GROUPS OF ACTIONS IN A COUNTRY WHO NEED THAT INCLUDING MEDICAL DOCTORS BUT ALSO EDUCATORS AND PEOPLE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THE ECONOMICAL PROBLEMS 
FOR INSTANCE IN UGANDA TAKING ONE EXAMPLE IN UGANDA THERE ARE ONE MILLION ORPHANS CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST ONE OF THEIR PARENTS AND THE AIDS IMPACT IS ECONOMICAL BECAUSE THOSE PARENTS WERE ACTIVE PEOPLE AND THEY DIED THEY JUST DISAPPEARED 
AND THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCE FOR THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY WHICH IS REALLY A VERY POOR COUNTRY 
PROFESSOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE CREDITED WITH IDENTIFYING THE AIDS VIRUS 
OF COURSE THE HOLY GRAIL IS A MEDICAL CURE FOR AIDS 
IS THAT POSSIBLE 
DO YOU THINK WE'RE EVER GOING TO FIND A MEDICAL CURE FOR AIDS 
I THINK WE EVENTUALLY WILL FIND SOMETHING 
OF COURSE IT'S NOT WILL BE A MIRACLE 
I THINK THIS WILL GO PROGRESSIVELY 
FOR INSTANCE WE ALREADY LEARNED A LOT FROM THE DISEASE AND THE VIRUS AND THIS HAS LED TO NEW TYPE TREATMENTS 
AND THERE WILL BE MORE TREATMENTS AND NEW WAYS OF TREATMENTS IN THE FUTURE 
ALSO THERE IS THE PROBLEM OF THE AIDS VACCINES WHICH IS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE BUT WE EVENTUALLY COULD SUCCEED IN THAT BUT THIS WILL TAKE TIME AND WE CANNOT WAIT 
SO THE PROBLEM IS NOW TO TRY TO AVOID THE SPREADING OF THE VIRUS BY EDUCATION 
I THINK THIS IS REALLY WE MUST AVOID 
YEAH YOU FACE A LOT OF OPPOSITION 
LET'S TALK ABOUT CONDOMS 
I MEAN THE VATICAN OPPOSES YOU ON THIS 
YOU'VE SPOKEN OUT FIRMLY ON THIS YET NO CHANGE TEN YEARS INTO THIS 
NO BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME CHANGE IN THE CONSENSUS OF PRIESTS OF SOME CATHOLIC PRIESTS AND WHAT I'M ASKING THE VATICAN IS NOT TO PROMOTE THE CONDOM IT IS JUST TO BE NEUTRAL AND NOT TO PREVENT THE CONDOM CAMPAIGNS 
I THINK WE COULD ACHIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY 
WELL GOOD LUCK IN YOUR EFFORTS 
DOCTOR LUC OF THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE ON DIPLOMATIC LICENSE 
THANK YOU 
AS WE SAID EARLIER DOCTOR WAS AT THE U. N. THIS WEEK 
SOMEONE WHO PASSED BY OUTSIDE THE U. N. WAS THE MAN WHO TOLD THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY A FEW MONTHS AGO JUST SAY NO A FEW TIMES 
OF COURSE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT PEACEKEEPING EFFORTS
