THE WORLD USED TO BE A PRETTY SIMPLE PLACE THERE WERE TWO SUPER POWERS EACH WITH ITS OWN DIFFERENT CIRCLE OF ALLIES AND THERE WAS EVERYBODY ELSE 
THE END OF THE COLD WAR ALSO ENDED THAT NEAT DIVISION OF WORLD POLITICS 
THE WAR IN BOSNIA HERCEGOVINA IS HIGHLIGHTING THE THAT REMAIN BETWEEN THE U. S. AND THE NATIONS THAT WERE ONCE ALLIED WITH THE SOVIET UNION 
A SUMMIT MEETING OF THE CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE IS UNDERWAY TODAY IN BUDAPEST HUNGARY 
MORE THAN FIFTY NATIONS BELONG TO THE ORGANIZATION WHICH HOPES TO FIND WAYS OF PREVENTING WARS LIKE THE ONE IN BOSNIA 
BUT NEITHER THE CSCE NOR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION IS HAVING ANY SUCCESS IN BOSNIA 
EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS MET WITH SERBIAN LEADERS IN BELGRADE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT HE CAN DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE FIGHTING 
BOSNIA SERB FORCES DID RELEASE SOME OF THE U. N. PEACEKEEPERS THEY HAD DETAINED BUT THEY SHOW NO SIGN OF EASING THEIR OFFENSIVE IN NORTHWESTERN BOSNIA 
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR HAS TODAY'S TOP STORY 
THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF FRANCE AND BRITAIN WENT TO BELGRADE TO BEND THE EAR OF THE SERBIAN PRESIDENT HOPING TO MAKE HIM TWIST THE ARM OF THE BOSNIAN SERBS 
THE U. S. SENT ITS SPECIAL ENVOY TO SARAJEVO TO SHOW THAT IT'S NOT AT CROSS PURPOSES WITH THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT 
THE AMERICAN POSITION AS YOU KNOW HASN'T CHANGED AND I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD IN THE PART OF THE LETTER THAT PRIME MINISTER READ ABOUT REAFFIRMATION 
LET ME BE CLEAR THE UNITED STATES REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE PRESERVATION OF BOSNIA HERCEGOVINA AS A SINGLE STATE WITHIN ITS EXISTING BORDERS 
UP IN HIS STRONGHOLD OF THE BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RADOVAN HAS BEEN REAFFIRMING HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS HARD LINE 
NO TO A BIHAC CEASEFIRE NO TO THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE PLAN AND ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN PROMISES TO RELEASE THE THREE HUNDRED OR SO U. N. HOSTAGES PROMPTING U. N. BRIEFERS THIS WEEK INTO OPEN FRUSTRATION 
THIS UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF BY THE BOSNIAN SERB PARTY IS CERTAINLY NOT MAKING OUR JOBS HERE ANY EASIER 
THE SERB MISSILE THREAT HAS SHUT DOWN THE HUMANITARIAN AIR LIFT FOR TWO WEEKS AND NO HUMANITARIAN CONVOYS ARE MOVING ON SERB TERRITORY 
BUT THE U. N. SAYS IT'S STILL TRYING TO GET THE SERBS TO 
AS A GOOD OLD BOXER DOES I KEEP PUNCHING 
THOUGH MANY ARGUE THE U. S. IS LESS THE THESE DAYS AND MORE THE PUNCHING BAG 
THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THE U. N. AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO USE THE HUMANITARIAN STAND STILL AND THE THREAT TO SCRAP THE ENTIRE U. N. MISSION TO FURTHER PRESSURE THEM INTO GIVING GROUND
