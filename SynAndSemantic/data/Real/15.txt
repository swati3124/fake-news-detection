THE AMERICAS CUP RACES CONTINUE IN SAN DIEGO TODAY AND ALL EYES SEEM TO BE ON ITALY'S ENTRY 
C. N. N.'S CHARLES JACO TELLS US ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT THAT THE ITALIAN CHALLENGER IS CREATING 
THE FIRST ITALIAN CHALLENGER IN THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE YEAR HISTORY OF THE AMERICAS CUP IS THE VENICE NAMED FOR SHAKESPEARE'S WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE 
ITALIAN FANS HOPE THAT IS NOT AN OMEN 
IT'S VERY VERY EXCITING FOR US AND WE'RE ALL ROOTING FOR THE BOAT AND WE BELIEVE IT'S A WONDERFUL BOAT 
THE ITALIANS WERE A JOKE IN WORLD CLASS RACING UNTIL RECENTLY BUT NO ONE LAUGHS NOW 
NONE OF THIS CAME CHEAP TO THE ITALIANS OR ANY OF THE OTHER ENTRIES 
ASK THE KANSAS MILLIONAIRE WHO OWNS THE U. S. BOAT NAMED AMERICA 
A FULLY OUTFITTED BOAT COSTS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE AMERICAS CUP YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE AT LEAST TWO BOATS AND UP TO FOUR OR FIVE BOATS 
LAND LOCKED SPECTATORS MAY DRINK BEER BUT THE RACING IS STRICTLY FOR THE CHAMPAGNE CROWD 
ALL THE SYNDICATES WHO ORIGINALLY COMPETED FOR THIS YEAR'S CUP SPENT OVER ONE HALF OF A DOLLAR BILLION DOLLARS 
THE AMERICAS CUP IS A TEST OF SPORTSMANSHIP BUT IT'S ALSO A TEST OF TECHNOLOGY AND A TEST OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE 
FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICA SYNDICATE EVEN HIRED AN ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE BOAT TO KEEP EYES AND EARS ON THE ITALIAN ENTRY DURING ITS PRELIMINARY RUNS WHICH HELPS ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT THE U. S. AND ITALIAN GROUPS DO NOT LIKE ONE ANOTHER 
OF COURSE WE HAVE SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL BATTLE THAT IS PART OF THE GAME 
IT'S LIKE TWO DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES TRYING TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY 
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING THAT IS KIND OF YOU KNOW AN ONGOING THING THAT'S KIND OF COME ALONG THROUGH THE YEARS 
MUTUAL RESPECT AND MAYBE MUTUAL DISLIKE AT THE SAME TIME 
ABSOLUTELY 
IF THE U. S. ENTRY WINS THIS BEST OF SEVEN RACE SERIES THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE RACES ARE IN SAN DIEGO AND IF THE ITALIANS WIN THESE MEGA EXPENSIVE CRAFTS COMPETE NEXT OFF VENICE
