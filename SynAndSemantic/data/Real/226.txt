AS WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE EXPRESSING REGRET ABOUT THE BLOODSHED IN MOSCOW BUT THEY ARE LINING UP BEHIND PRESIDENT YELTSIN SAYING HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACT 
C. N. N.'S ROB REYNOLDS HAS MORE ON THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REACTION 
AS THE FIGHTING IN MOSCOW RAGED EUROPEAN LEADERS ONCE AGAIN PLEDGED FULL SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENT BORIS YELTSIN 
I DON'T BELIEVE OVER THE LAST DAY OR SO THAT PRESIDENT YELTSIN HAD ANY CHOICE BUT TO ACT AS HE DID AND I VERY MUCH ADMIRE HIS RESTRAINT OVER RECENT MONTHS 
THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS OUR TOTAL AND UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE ACTION THAT HE'S TAKEN 
FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE TWELVE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY NATIONS ISSUED A STATEMENT BACKING YELTSIN IN HIS REFORMS 
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO WANT DEMOCRATIZATION AND REFORMS IN RUSSIA AS MR. YELTSIN AND HIS 
IT IS EXTREMELY DEPLORABLE THAT HIS OPPONENTS HAVE SOUGHT VIOLENCE WHICH HAS LEFT PRESIDENT YELTSIN VERY LITTLE CHOICE I'M AFRAID 
WE ARE ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE ON THE PATH OF REFORM 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
THE VIOLENCE IN MOSCOW IS MONITORED CLOSELY BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WHICH PROVIDES A LARGE PORTION OF RUSSIA'S FINANCIAL AID 
VIOLENCE IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY IN A SITUATION WHICH HAS GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL TO BRING THINGS BACK INTO LINE 
WHILE EUROPEAN SUPPORT FOR YELTSIN IS UNANIMOUS ANALYSTS SAY IT MAY BE A MISTAKE TO PUT ALL WESTERN EGGS IN YELTSIN'S BASKET 
REMEMBER WE WENT OVERBOARD ON GORBACHEV HIS PREDECESSOR AND WERE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN HE WAS EDGED OUT 
I THINK IF YELTSIN IS EDGED OUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE REALLY PREPARED FOR THAT 
I HOPE HOWEVER THAT DESPITE ALL THIS SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GIVING YELTSIN SOMEBODY'S MAKING CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR SOME KIND OF ALTERNATIVE 
YELTSIN'S APPARENT VICTORY IN THE LATEST CRISIS BROUGHT RELIEF TO EUROPEAN LEADERS BUT NONE COULD BE CONFIDENT THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE MORE INSTABILITY IN RUSSIA'S FUTURE
