WELL TRUTH OR OLD TALE THAT CRANBERRY JUICE PREVENTS BLADDER INFECTION 
THE ANSWER IS IN A NEW SCIENTIFIC STUDY PERHAPS 
C. N. N.'S LIZ WEISS HAS THE STORY IN TODAY'S FOOD AND HEALTH REPORT 
FROM CHICKEN SOUP AND THE COMMON COLD TO CRANBERRY JUICE FOR BLADDER INFECTIONS 
WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD AND FOLKLORE THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF HOME HEALTH REMEDIES 
BUT ACCORDING TO A STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THERE MAY BE SOME SCIENTIFIC MERIT TO DRINKING CRANBERRY JUICE TO TREAT A URINARY INFECTION 
IN A STUDY FROM BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL A GROUP OF WOMEN IN THEIR LATE SEVENTIES WERE GIVEN CRANBERRY JUICE OR A PLACEBO TO DRINK EVERY DAY FOR SIX MONTHS 
WE FOUND THAT AMONG WOMEN WHO WERE ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE EITHER CRANBERRY JUICE OR A DUMMY BEVERAGE THAT LOOKED LIKE IT THE ONES WHO RECEIVED CRANBERRY JUICE HAD A GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY OF HAVING BACTERIA OR WHITE BLOOD CELLS IN THEIR URINE 
PEOPLE USED TO BELIEVE THE ACID IN CRANBERRY JUICE KILLED THE BACTERIA WHICH CAUSES URINARY INFECTIONS 
BUT THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A CHEMICAL IN AND WHICH PREVENTS THOSE BAD BACTERIA FROM STICKING TO THE BLADDER WALL 
WHILE THE INFECTION WAS CLEARLY REDUCED IN THOSE WHO DRANK THE CRANBERRY JUICE DOCTOR IS NOW RESEARCHING THE EFFECT ON YOUNGER WOMEN 
HE HOPES TO FIND OUT IF REGULAR CONSUMPTION PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING URINARY INFECTIONS 
I ALWAYS HEARD I GUESS FROM MY MOTHER THAT IT WAS GOOD TO DRINK CRANBERRY JUICE WITH YOUR MEALS AND IT HELPS YOU DIGEST BETTER AND IT DID DO AN AWFUL LOT FOR YOUR KIDNEYS AND OUT THE IN YOUR BODY 
MARY LOU SUFFERS FROM RECURRING BLADDER INFECTIONS 
IN DOCTOR LATEST STUDY SHE'S AGREED TO DRINK TEN OUNCES OF A MYSTERY JUICE EVERY DAY 
I DO GET URINARY INFECTIONS 
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT THE OUTCOME OF CRANBERRY JUICE ON URINARY INFECTIONS 
BUT NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME MAY BE CRANBERRY JUICE SHOULD NEVER REPLACE A DOCTOR'S CARE 
IT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTE AT THIS POINT FOR ANTIBIOTICS IF SOMEBODY'S HAVING SYMPTOMS 
UNTIL MORE STUDY RESULTS ARE IN DOCTOR SAYS THERE'S CERTAINLY NO HARM IN ADDING IT TO YOUR DIET
