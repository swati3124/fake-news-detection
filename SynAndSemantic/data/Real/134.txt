IN SOUTH AFRICA TODAY WHAT SO MANY OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADERS HAD FEARED MOST 
DESPITE AN APPEAL FOR CALM FROM THE COUNTRY'S MOST FAMOUS BLACK LEADERS BLACKS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY DEMONSTRATED THEIR ANGER AT THE MURDER OF THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS LEADER CHRIS HANI OVER THE WEEKEND 
IT WAS ANOTHER CHANCE TO REBEL AGAINST THE SYSTEM IN GENERAL 
IN SOUTH AFRICA FOR US DON KLADSTRUP 
WHAT HAD BEEN BILLED AS A DAY OF NATIONAL MOURNING BECAME A DAY OF TERRIFYING CHAOS WITH ANGRY CROWDS LOOTING DOWNTOWN STORES AND POLICE AND SOLDIERS TRYING TO HOLD THEM BACK 
BUT BULLETS AND SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT AS RAMPAGING MOBS SIMPLY DEFIED AUTHORITIES BREAKING WINDOWS BURNING VEHICLES AND TURNING CAPE TOWN'S BUSINESS DISTRICT INTO A CAULDRON OF FIRE AND SMOKE 
THERE WERE SCORES OF CASUALTIES AND THE THREAT OF MANY MORE 
THIS VIOLENCE IS GOING TO BE THE SAME AS THE LOS ANGELES VIOLENCE 
WHAT IT SHOWED WAS HOW LITTLE CONTROL BLACK LEADERS HAVE OVER YOUNG MILITANTS 
IN THE BLACK TOWNSHIP OF SOWETO WHEN NELSON MANDELA PLEADED FOR RESTRAINT HE WAS BOOED AND HECKLED 
VERY WELL VERY WELL 
I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANGER 
BUT HE MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THAT ANGER 
AFTER HIS SPEECH THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS MARCHED ON A NEARBY POLICE STATION AND BEGAN THROWING ROCKS 
MINUTES LATER WHAT EVERYONE PRAYED WOULD NOT HAPPEN DID 
OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED WHEN THE POLICE OPENED FIRE 
AT LEAST FOUR WERE KILLED 
THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS CONDEMNED THE SHOOTING BUT PLAYED DOWN THE VIOLENCE 
INSTEAD IT CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON TURNING OVER POWER TO BLACKS 
THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS MUST NOW BE SPEEDED UP BECAUSE IF IT DOES NOT GATHER MOMENTUM WORSE COULD HAPPEN 
ON A CITY STREET A BEWILDERED WOMAN WATCHED NERVOUSLY HER FACE REFLECTING THE AGONIZING QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND WHAT NEXT
