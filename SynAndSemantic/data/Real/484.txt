THERE WAS A REALITY CHECK ABOUT AIR SAFETY TODAY AND GOVERNMENT 
YESTERDAY THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY FEDERICO PENA SAID THAT HE WANTED THE SAFETY RULES THAT GOVERN THE NATION'S LARGE AIRLINES EXTENDED TO THE COMMUTER CARRIERS WITHIN ONE HUNDRED DAYS 
THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION SAID TODAY THERE HAS TO BE COMMENT FROM THE AIRLINES AND THEN REVIEW AND THE RULES WILL NOT BE IN PLACE UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
IN CHICAGO TODAY THE OWNERS OF THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAMS WERE MEETING AGAIN ON THE ISSUE THAT COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE NEXT SEASON WHETHER TO IMPOSE A CAP ON PLAYERS' SALARIES 
THE MEETING IS OVER NOW THE OWNERS HAVE DECIDED TO WAIT ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS BEFORE MAKING A DECISION 
A LITTLE MORE TIME TO TALK SOME MORE WITH THE PLAYERS 
HERE'S A. B. C.'S 
IT HAS BEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DAYS SINCE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS WENT ON STRIKE 
UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE OWNERS' DEMAND TO PUT A CAP ON TEAM SALARIES 
STILL IT SEEMED LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL TODAY IN BASEBALL 
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST IS THE DEADLINE FOR YANKEE SEASON TICKET HOLDERS TO MAKE A FIFTY PERCENT DEPOSIT ON THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SEASON A SEASON IN WHICH FOUR TEAMS INCLUDING THE COLORADO ROCKIES HAVE RAISED TICKET PRICES 
BUSINESS IS BOOMING 
BUSINESS IS GREAT 
AND WE HAVE A WAITING LIST OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING SEASON TICKETS FOR THE NINETY FIVE SEASON 
BASEBALL OWNERS ALSO CONTINUE TO DEAL IN HIGH PRICE TALENT 
YESTERDAY THE PHILADELPHIA SIGNED FREE AGENT GREG JEFFRIES TO A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT THE SAME DAY THE CHICAGO WHITE SOX TRADED CY YOUNG WINNER JACK MCDOWELL TO THE YANKEES 
I MADE THE BEST DEAL I THOUGHT AT THIS TIME THAT WAS POSSIBLE 
AT THIS TIME THE OWNERS INSIST THEY'LL OPEN SPRING TRAINING CAMPS IN LATE FEBRUARY WITH MAJOR LEAGUERS DEFYING THEIR UNION OR REPLACEMENT PLAYERS FROM THE MINOR LEAGUES 
THE PROSPECT OF MARKETING MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WITHOUT MAJOR LEAGUE TALENT COULD MEAN LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS NETWORKS AND ADVERTISERS ABANDON THE SPORT 
THIS YEAR BASEBALL OWNERS WERE FORCED TO REFUND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TELEVISION ADVERTISERS AFTER THE SEASON WAS CANCELED IN AUGUST 
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE NOW IS SHOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT CAUSED ADVERTISERS TO REALLY WONDER IF THEY SHOULD INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEHIND THIS SPORT TO MARKET PRODUCTS 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYERS' STRIKE CRUMBLED WHEN THE NETWORKS AND THEIR ADVERTISERS WILLINGLY AIRED N. F. L. GAMES WITH REPLACEMENT PLAYERS 
BUT THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN BASEBALL 
THE NETWORK T. V. DEAL DOESN'T KICK IN UNTIL JULY 
UNTIL THEN LOCAL STATIONS AND THEIR ADVERTISERS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO PAY FOR GAMES FEATURING LESSER NAME TALENT
