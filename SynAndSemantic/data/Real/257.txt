JAPAN'S ECONOMY WAS ONCE THE ENVY OF NATIONS TODAY IT'S IN RECESSION 
I'M DEBORAH MARCHINI WHAT'S BECOME OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMIC MIRACLE WHO WANTED A PIECE OF THE WORLD 
FIND OUT ON INSIDE BUSINESS ELEVEN THIRTY PM EASTERN SUNDAY ON C. N. N. 
MORTGAGE RATES DROPPED SLIGHTLY THIS PAST WEEK AFTER RISING FOR THE PAST MONTH 
THE AVERAGE RATE ON THIRTY YEAR FIX RATE HOME LOANS DROPPING TO JUST BELOW SEVEN PERCENT SIX POINT NINE NINE TO BE PRECISE 
FIFTEEN YEAR FIXED SIX POINT FOUR SEVEN IS THE AVERAGE 
ONE YEAR ADJUSTABLES FOUR POINT OH SIX PERCENT 
MOVE ON TO CONSUMER LOANS A NEW CAR LOAN AT A BANK THE AVERAGE IS SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT PERSONAL LOANS UNSECURED THAT IS FIFTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT AND YOU'RE STILL PAYING SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT ON CREDIT CARD DEBT 
THE DILEMMA FOR SAVERS CONTINUES AFTER INFLATION SOME C. D.S ARE YIELDING LESS THAN A HALF PERCENT SO FAR THIS YEAR INFLATION IS RUNNING AT TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT

WELL GETTING THE BILL FOR YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MAY BE ENOUGH TO KNOCK YOU RIGHT ON YOUR BACK 
THE HIGH COST OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW DRUGS IS OFTEN FUNNELED ON TO THE CONSUMER BUT GENERIC DRUGS CAN BE A LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE KELLI ARENA REPORTS 
WELCOME TO THE COLD SEASON 
THIS YEAR A LOT OF CONSUMERS WILL BE PAYING TOP DOLLAR FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO FIGHT THE FLU AND THE COMMON COLD 
BUT BEFORE YOU STOCK UP ON THE LATEST REMEDIES YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER GENERIC DRUGS 
ARE COPIES OF BRAND NAME DRUGS WHOSE PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED 
A NEW DRUG TAKES ABOUT TWELVE YEARS TO DEVELOP AND COSTS AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS 
BUT SINCE GENERIC DRUG COMPANIES DON'T PAY FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OFTEN COST HALF THE AMOUNT OF THEIR BRAND NAME 
BUT LOWER COSTS DON'T GET SOME CONSUMERS OVER THE HURDLE OF BRAND NAME LOYALTY AND THE TWO PRODUCTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IDENTICAL 
THERE'S MORE TO A DRUG THAN JUST THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE DRUG 
THERE'S THE BINDERS THE SOLUTIONS THE THAT GO IN TO THE DRUGS 
THERE'S THE TASTE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN MY CHILDREN AT LEAST DON'T LIKE THE TASTE FREQUENTLY OF GENERIC PRODUCTS COMPARED TO THE BRAND NAME PRODUCTS 
SO THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES 
ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE MONEY IS BY USING STORE BRAND OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS 
MOST LARGE DRUG STORES AND EVEN GROCERY STORES CARRY THEIR OWN LINE OF REMEDIES AND 
IF IT'S FOR A COLD OR SOMETHING THAT'S A RELATIVELY MINOR COMPLAINT IT SAVES YOU A LOT OF MONEY 
I THINK IT'D BE A VERY REASONABLE THING TO DO 
WHEN YOU CHOOSE A STORE BRAND DRUG ONLY BUY FROM A REPUTABLE COMPANY AND IF YOU'RE ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS YOU CAN ONLY SWITCH TO WITH APPROVAL FROM YOUR PHYSICIAN 
THAT'S YOUR MONEY
