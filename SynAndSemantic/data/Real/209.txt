ALTHOUGH THE WATER IS BACK ON IN DES MOINES IOWA IT'S STILL NOT SAFE TO DRINK 
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE RACCOON AND DES MOINES RIVERS FLOODED RESIDENTS OF DES MOINES ARE DIGGING OUT FROM THEIR WORST NATURAL DISASTER THEY'VE EVER FACED 
BUSINESSES THERE ESTIMATE THEIR LOSSES AT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS 
AND AS MARK OF MEMBER STATION REPORTS RESIDENTS RETURNING HOME ARE FINDING THE DAMAGE IS WORSE THAN THEY IMAGINED 
IN A SEVENTY YEAR OLD HOUSE RIGHT ON THE DES MOINES RIVER SIXTEEN YEAR OLD RANDY TERRELL IS SIFTING THROUGH WHAT'S LEFT IN THE BASEMENT 
HE LIVES HERE WITH HIS MOTHER AND HER BOYFRIEND 
WHEN THE FLOOD CAME HE SAYS THE WATER RUSHED IN SO QUICKLY IT TURNED THE DEEP FREEZE OVER AND SENT MEAT FLOATING FREELY THROUGHOUT THE BASEMENT 
OUR HOUSE IS SUCH A DISASTER AREA RIGHT NOW CAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH LOOTING GOING ON EVERYTHING OUR HOUSE WAS BROKEN INTO DURING THAT AND WE'VE GOT LIKE RIGHT NOW WE HAD BUCKETS 
I MUST WARN YOU THIS FLOOR IS SLICK 
IT'S DRIED OUT PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW BUT 
AT THE HOLIDAY INN MOTEL JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE DES MOINES WATER WORKS PLANT THE DAMAGE WAS MUCH WORSE 
THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE CLEAN UP PAT RUSH CHECKS GIANT PUMPS AND GENERATORS 
THEY'RE WORKING TO CLEAN UP THE DEBRIS LEFT BEHIND WHEN SIX FEET OF WATER FORCED ITS WAY IN 
THE MURKY WATER LEFT A DARK BROWN FILM ON WHAT'S LEFT OF THE WALLS ON THE FIRST FLOOR 
THE STINKING CARPET AND MOST OF THE HAS BEEN TORN OUT THE SWIMMING POOL IS FULL OF MUD AND MOST OF THE FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS BROKE UNDER THE WATER'S PRESSURE 
CLEAN UP EQUIPMENT NOW THROUGH THE LOBBY WHERE THE GUESTS USED TO 
NOW THE RESTROOM IS TO YOUR RIGHT THERE AND THIS WOULD BE THE FRONT DESK 
THERE AIN'T TOO MUCH OF LEFT OF HER 
GOVERNORS FROM SEVERAL MIDWEST STATES INCLUDING IOWA ARE HEADING TO WASHINGTON TODAY TO LOBBY CONGRESS FOR MORE FLOOD AID 
BUT THERE'S A PLACE IN DES MOINES WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET THE MOST BASIC NECESSITIES WITHOUT WAITING FOR CONGRESS 
THE SALVATION ARMY HAS TURNED A VACANT DEPARTMENT STORE INTO A FLOOD RELIEF WAREHOUSE 
CAPTAIN MARGARET MILES IS IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION 
WE HAVE PACKED UP FOOD THAT VOLUNTEERS HAVE ALREADY SORTED AND BOXED UP AN ASSORTMENT OF FOOD AND IT'S READY TO GO OUT AS IS 
DONATIONS HAVE COME TO THIS WAREHOUSE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
HAND WRITTEN MESSAGES ARE ATTACHED TO MANY OF THE PACKAGES 
DEAR FRIEND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO HAVE A FLOOD BUT I GAVE THIS SO THAT YOUR FEELINGS WILL BE NICER 
I HOPE YOU FEEL YOU BETTER 
HEY DO YOU WANT A PEN PAL 
THREE HUNDRED SEMI TRUCKS HAVE FILLED THE HUGE TILE FLOOR HERE FROM WALL TO WALL WITH CLOTHES USED FURNITURE AND MOUNTAINS OF DISPOSABLE DIAPERS 
THE SALVATION ARMY OPENED THE RELIEF CENTER TO FLOOD VICTIMS TODAY 
IT WILL STAY OPEN THROUGH SATURDAY AND LONGER IF NEEDED 
FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN DES MOINES IT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER FOR LIFE TO RETURN TO NORMAL
