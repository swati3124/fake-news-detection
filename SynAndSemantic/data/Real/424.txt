BORIS YELTSIN STILL MEMORIES OF HIS STANDING ON A RUSSIAN ARMY TANK DEFYING THE OF A FOILED COUP 
BUT HE IS ALSO REMEMBERED AS THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT WHO ASSAULTED HIS COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT AND BARRED NEWSPAPERS FROM PUBLISHING 
NOW SOME ASSESSMENTS OF BORIS YELTSIN FROM THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED HIM CLOSELY 
BRITISH JOURNALIST JONATHAN STEELE WRITES IN A BOOK CALLED ETERNAL RUSSIA THAT YELTSIN DOES NOT PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP THAT RUSSIA NEEDS 
STEELE YELTSIN'S ATTACK ON THE PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR TO HIM IT WAS A CASE NOT OF RESISTANCE TO BUT OF YELTSIN'S OWN INABILITY TO COMPROMISE 
HE'S TEMPERAMENTALLY AND AND POLITICALLY NOT A MAN OF DIALOGUE 
HE WAS AFTER ALL PART OF THE OLD COMMUNIST APPARATUS 
HE WAS A REGIONAL PARTY CHIEF WHICH WAS A JOB WHERE YOU TENDED TO GIVE ORDERS YOU RECEIVED ORDERS FROM MOSCOW THEN YOU GAVE ORDERS TO PEOPLE DOWN THE LINE ALMOST LIKE A MILITARY STRUCTURE 
YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO WHEEL AND DEAL WITH PEOPLE ON YOUR ON LEVEL WHO HAD POWER BASES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT 
SO HIS PHILOSOPHY SEEMED TO BE TO DESTROY THE POWER BASE OF PEOPLE HE DISAGREED WITH RATHER THAN TO TRY AND ACCEPT THAT IT WAS A PERMANENT FEATURE OF THE NEW RUSSIA TO HAVE A STRONG PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS A STRONG PRESIDENT AND TO DO THE NORMAL DEALS THAT A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT HAS TO DO 
EVEN YELTSIN'S ADMIRERS ADMIT THAT HE IN AN AUTHORITARIAN FASHION BUT LEON WHO'S WORKING ON A BIOGRAPHY OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT THINKS IT THE STRONG HAND OF A NATION BUILDER A RUSSIAN CHARLES DE GAULLE BUILDING A RIGID FRAMEWORK FOR A FLEXIBLE DEMOCRACY STILL TO COME 
IT'S THE END PROCESS THAT WILL TELL US WHETHER THIS IS INDEED A STABILIZATION ACCOMPLISHED WITH VERY STRONG INJECTION OF EXECUTIVE POWER FROM ABOVE WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY ONCE THE SOCIETY WILL REMOVE ITSELF GRADUALLY FROM THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE OR WHETHER THE PROCESS GIVEN THE RUSSIAN INERTIA WILL CONTINUE AND YELTSIN WILL INDEED TRY TO BECOME AN AUTHORITARIAN DICTATOR 
MY PERSONAL FEELING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THERE ANYTHING HE TREASURES ABOUT HIS PUBLIC PERSONA IT'S THAT HE'S A DEMOCRAT 
OTHERS FIND LESS TO TREASURE ABOUT BORIS YELTSIN'S PUBLIC PERSONA 
ANOTHER NEWLY PUBLISHED APPRAISAL OF YELTSIN AND RUSSIAN ECONOMIC REFORMS IS LOST OPPORTUNITY WHY ECONOMIC REFORMS IN RUSSIA HAVE NOT WORKED 
IT'S BY MARSHALL GOLDMAN 
HE'S A FIGURE 
WHEN HE'S ON THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A BETTER POLITICIAN IN RUSSIA AND IS SOME CASES MANY PARTS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
BUT WHEN HE'S OFF HE GOES INTO A FUNK 
HE HAS ALCOHOL PROBLEMS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THOSE 
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS IS TO READ HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IT'S IN THE SECOND EDITION AND HE TALKS ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL PROBLEMS HE TALKS ABOUT HIS MENTAL PROBLEMS 
I DON'T EVER REMEMBER READING ABOUT A SITTING PRESIDENT OR PRIME MINISTER OF ANY COUNTRY WHO TALKS ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT THESE THINGS ARE FOR HIM AND ALLUDES TO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW HE'S HAD CLOSE TO A MENTAL BREAKDOWN 
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT'S TERRIBLE 
HE WAS JUST IN GERMANY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND WAS SHOWN DRUNK ON TELEVISION 
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIM IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIS COUNTRY IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HIS PEOPLE 
AND THE DOUBTS AREN'T JUST ABOUT PERSONAL DECORUM 
AUTHOR JONATHAN STEELE FOUND A MOST TELLING EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S WRONG WITH YELTSIN'S LEADERSHIP IN ONE OF THE MOST BIZARRE EPISODES OF HIS PRESIDENCY THE CURRENCY RECALL OF NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
WELL THAT WAS A WEIRD THING 
IT JUST HAPPENED ON A SATURDAY MORNING 
YELTSIN WAS OUT OF TOWN AT HIS DACHA OR MANSION AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT EVERYBODY HAD TO TURN IN THEIR MONEY BY SUNDAY NIGHT AND IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH ANYTHING AFTER THAT EXCEPT THOSE NOTES THAT HAD BEEN PRINTED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
THIS WAS IN JULY NINETEEN NINETY THREE SO THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY AN AWFUL LOT OF NOTES THE VAST MAJORITY THAT HAD BEEN PRINTED BEFORE THAT 
IT CAUSED ABSOLUTE PANIC 
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT IT IT WAS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT TOOK THE PUBLIC BY SURPRISE BUT IT TOOK MANY OF THE KEY MINISTERS BY SURPRISE 
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE BORIS WAS ACTUALLY IN WASHINGTON WHEN THIS DECISION WAS TAKEN ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT BY THE CABINET 
AND HIS CIVIL SERVANTS AS IT WERE AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER MINISTRIES WHO WERE ALSO REFORMERS LIKE HIM NEVER PICKED A PHONE TO WASHINGTON TO TELL THAT THIS INCREDIBLE THING IS HAPPENING 
AND I THINK THIS SHOWS REALLY THE VERY OF THE WHOLE RUSSIAN SYSTEM 
YOU'VE JUST GOT REALLY A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WITHOUT A PROPER CIVIL SERVICE WITHOUT ANY REAL BACKUP WITHOUT ANY INSTITUTIONAL TRADITION OF CONSULTING AND CONTACTING EACH OTHER 
AND SO THESE THINGS ARE JUST COMPLETELY ARBITRARY 
AS FOR THE SUCCESS OF ECONOMIC REFORM UNDER YELTSIN JONATHAN STEELE THERE'S BEEN A LOT MORE SHOCK THAN THERAPY 
SO DOES MARSHALL GOLDMAN 
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HE SAYS HAS DECLINED BY HALF IN JUST THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE HAS BEEN WHAT MANY RUSSIANS ARE NOW DESCRIBING AS THE OF THE COUNTRY 
THAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY LOWERING THE RATE OF INFLATION 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE RATE OF INFLATION WAS TWENTY FOUR FOLD TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TIMES PRICES ROSE 
NOW INFLATION ON A MONTHLY BASIS IS DOWN BELOW FIVE PERCENT 
SO THAT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT 
BUT IT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN PART BY DESTROYING SOME OF THE INDUSTRY AND ALSO A LOT OF DISGUISED UNEMPLOYMENT AND OFFICIALLY NOW IT'S MAYBE FOUR PERCENT 
BUT UNOFFICIALLY USING U. N. STATISTICS IT COMES CLOSE TO TWELVE PERCENT WHICH MAY MEAN THAT THERE ARE TEN MILLION UNEMPLOYED 
SOME PEOPLE SAY FIFTEEN 
SO IT'S A VERY MIXED PACKAGE 
SOME IMPROVEMENT BUT CLEARLY A RADICAL KIND OF CHANGE NOT ALL OF IT FOR THE BEST 
BUT TO SUM UP WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID IF INFLATION IS RUNNING AT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT A YEAR OR MORE AND IF REAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT AND IF THE G. D. P. THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT OF RUSSIA HAS DECLINED INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION HAS DECLINED BY HALF OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF WE WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AS BEING IN A GREAT DEPRESSION IF WE WERE EXPERIENCING THIS RIGHT NOW 
WE CERTAINLY WOULD AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS I THINK CONCERN ABOUT YELTSIN'S POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY 
BOTH GOLDMAN AND JONATHAN STEELE IN THEIR NEW BOOKS ON RUSSIA CONCLUDE THAT YELTSIN HAS COME UP AGAINST OBSTACLES MORE ENDURING THAN COMMUNIST PARTY RULE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL FACTORS THAT MAKE RUSSIA TO MARKET ECONOMICS AND DEMOCRACY 
LEON WHO TAKES A FAR MORE UPBEAT VIEW OF YELTSIN IN GENERAL IS ALSO MORE POSITIVE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS HE'S MADE 
FIRST LET'S SEE WHERE HE STARTED IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
YOU REMEMBER AFTER THE ANTI COMMUNIST REVOLUTION AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE PREDICTIONS WERE THAT RUSSIA WOULD BE VISITED BY OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS STARVATION CIVIL WAR TOTAL DISRUPTION OF ANY AND SOME SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE THROWN BACK TO WHERE PEOPLE WILL JUST BE GOING NATURAL BARTER EXCHANGE 
NOTHING OF THAT SORT HAPPENED 
CREDIT YELTSIN 
THERE'S REALLY NOBODY ELSE TO CREDIT 
I MEAN THE COUNTRY'S VIABLE ECONOMICALLY 
NOBODY'S STARVING 
BUT THERE IS A PLAGUE IN YELTSIN'S RUSSIA THAT EVERYONE REMARKS ON 
CORRUPTION IS RIFE EXTORTION BRIBE TAKING THE LOOTING OF PREVIOUSLY PUBLIC ASSETS 
HERE'S JONATHAN STEELE 
THE DEGREE OF AND CORRUPTION NOW IS SO EXCESSIVE THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND ONE HONEST MAN OR WOMAN THERE 
AND I THINK IN ANY SYSTEM ONCE THE BALANCE TIPS SO FAR IN ONE DIRECTION IT'S VERY HARD TO GET IT BACK AGAIN 
IF THERE WAS TEN PERCENT LET'S SAY OF CORRUPTION AND NINETY PERCENT WAS HONEST BUSINESS GRADUALLY GROWING UP THEN THE TEN PERCENT MIGHT ELIMINATE DOWN TO ONE PERCENT 
YOU THINK THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT OF 
I THINK I THINK NOW YOU KNOW IT'S MORE LIKE NINETY PERCENT IS CORRUPT 
AND I THINK EVEN MORE THAN THAT IT'S THE LACK OF INVESTMENT 
THERE'S VERY HIGH CONSUMPTION BY THESE NEW MILLIONAIRE THEY'RE BUYING THEIR MERCEDES CARS AND THEIR B. M. W.'S AND SO THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY ABROAD IN FOREIGN BANKS BUYING AND PROPERTY ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY INVESTING PRODUCTIVELY IN A NEW CAPITALIST ECONOMY IN RUSSIA 
AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
CRIME AND CORRUPTION AS IT TURNS OUT ARE ABSOLUTELY ENDEMIC TO POST COMMUNIST SOCIETIES 
THIS IS LEON EXPLANATION OF RUSSIA'S ERA OF GOOD 
I THINK THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SORT OF WHALE OF THE STATE ECONOMY THAT'S SORT OF LYING THERE ROTTING AND THE ARE THERE PICKING AT IT 
AND I HOPE THAT ONCE THEY'RE THEY'LL RETIRE TO FLORIDA OR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHERE THEY'RE BUYING HOUSES AT THIS POINT AND JUST LEAVE THE ECONOMY ALONE 
BUT MARSHALL GOLDMAN WHOSE SPECIALTY IS THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY FINDS RUSSIAN CORRUPTION AND ORGANIZED CRIME TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OTHER FORMERLY COMMUNIST COUNTRIES 
FOR ME ONE OF THE FASCINATING THINGS IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT POLAND HUNGARY OR CHINA COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE ALSO BEEN COMMUNIST AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION THEY DON'T HAVE 
SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY 
WHY IS IT SO STRONG IN RUSSIA SO PERVASIVE AS IT WERE AND NOT IN THOSE OTHER AREAS 
AND I THINK IT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN THE CASE OF POLAND WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR REFORMS THEY HAD MANY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE FARMS HAD NEVER BEEN AND THERE WAS A PRIVATE SECTOR ALREADY 
AND WHEN THE REFORMS BEGAN THEY ALLOWED ANYONE WHO WANTED TO TO GO UP AND OPEN UP BUSINESS AND SO YOU HAD ENORMOUS COMPETITION 
AND YOU HAD SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE YOU COULDN'T GET A GROUP OF TOGETHER TO COERCE THEM THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH ACTIVITY AND IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE 
THE SAME THING HOLDS IN CHINA 
IN RUSSIA THIS GOES BACK TO GORBACHEV WHEN THEY BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO ALLOW PRIVATE ACTIVITY THEY ALLOWED VERY FEW 
AND THOSE FEW WHO DID MADE ENORMOUS PROFITS AND THEY THEN BECAME NATURAL TARGETS AND THE KIND OF JUST FINDING IT THE MAIN GROWTH INDUSTRY AND SO ULTIMATELY THEY NOW CONTROL ALL THESE THING 
AND THEY HAVE A BETTER TAX SYSTEM THAN THE STATE THEY HAVE A BETTER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAN THE STATE THEY BUY OUT MANY OF THE OFFICIALS IN THE STATE 
AND THE FACT THAT RUSSIA ALSO HAD THIS VERY LARGE INFLATION IN THE EARLY STAGES MEANT THAT YOU BASICALLY DESTROYED THE CIVIL SERVICE AND MADE THE POLICE VULNERABLE TO BRIBES AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO CORRUPTION 
ONE OF THE MOST CONCLUSIONS ABOUT YELTSIN THE RUSSIANS AND THE STATE OF REFORM COMES FROM JONATHAN STEELE IN HIS NEW BOOK 
STEELE COVERED MOSCOW FOR THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER THE GUARDIAN DURING BOTH THE BREZHNEV YEARS AND LATER IN THE GORBACHEV SLASH YELTSIN ERA 
HE IS STRUCK BY YELTSIN'S SHORTCOMINGS AND EQUALLY BY THE WAY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE RESPOND TO HIM FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT COMPLAINT IN SUCH HIGH HANDED NONSENSE OF THE RECALL OF ALL THE OLD RUBLE NOTES 
IT SHOWS A KIND OF AND AN APATHY AND A HOPELESSNESS IF YOU LIKE WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONSTRUCT A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY 
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY BETTER THAT THEY SHOULD BE PASSIVE THAN THAT THEY SHOULD RIOTING OR TEARING THINGS DOWN OR GOING ON THE RAMPAGE OR EVEN GOING ON MASSIVE STRIKES 
SO I THINK IN THAT SENSE YELTSIN HAS BEEN LUCKY THAT HE'S GOT A POPULATION WHICH DOES SEEM TO BE VERY PATIENT 
BUT MY FEAR ABOUT RUSSIA IS NOT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OR ZHIRINOVSKY OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT 
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN THAT THERE'LL BE ANARCHY IN THE SENSE THAT THE COUNTRY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNGOVERNABLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT PARLIAMENT DOES OR WHAT YELTSIN DOES OR WHETHER THEY LIVE IN HARMONY OR STRUGGLE OUT LIKE THEY DID A YEAR OR SO AGO 
THE ECONOMIC CONTROLS AND POLITICAL CONTROLS ARE JUST NOT THERE 
JONATHAN NEW BOOK IS CALLED ETERNAL RUSSIA YELTSIN GORBACHEV AND THE MIRAGE OF DEMOCRACY
