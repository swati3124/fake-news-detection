A VISIT TO THE FAMILY DOCTOR FOR SAY A COLD OR ANKLE COULD ALSO LEAD TO A DIAGNOSIS OF A MENTAL DISORDER 
C. N. N.'S ANDREW HOLTZ EXPLAINS HOW 
IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES A PHYSICIAN USED TO TREATING PHYSICAL ACHES AND PAINS CAN RUN A CHECK OF A PATIENT'S MENTAL HEALTH 
I CAN SEE FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS HAVE BEEN BOTHERING YOU IN THE LAST MONTH 
THE SCREENING SYSTEM IS CALLED PRIME M. D. SHORT FOR PRIMARY CARE EVALUATION OF MENTAL DISORDERS 
IT'S DEVELOPERS SAY A STUDY OF A THOUSAND PATIENTS FOUND PRIME M. D. DIAGNOSES ARE ACCURATE 
BY ACCURATE WE MEAN THEY HAD VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH DIAGNOSES MADE BY A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL A PSYCHOLOGIST AND A PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKER 
AS SEEN IN THIS DEMONSTRATION PRIME M. D. STARTS WITH THE PATIENT FILING OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT MOOD ANXIETY EATING AND ALCOHOL USE 
THE REASON FOR CREATING A MENTAL HEALTH EXAM TO BE USED BY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IS THAT'S WHERE THE PATIENTS ARE 
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS SEEING A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN HAVE A MENTAL DISORDER AND THESE ARE USUALLY DISORDERS THAT ARE QUITE 
THE RESEARCH REPORTED IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WAS FUNDED BY THE COMPANY THAT SELLS PRIME M. D. 
WHILE THE TEST MAY BE QUICK AND ACCURATE FOR DOCTORS TO USE IT MAY NOT BE EASY FOR PATIENTS TO GET TREATMENT BECAUSE INSURANCE PLANS OFTEN RESTRICT MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE 
OF COURSE WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PATIENTS WITH MENTAL DISORDERS BEING DISCRIMINATED AND NOT GIVEN THE KIND OF REIMBURSEMENT THAT PATIENTS WITH OTHER DISORDERS ARE
