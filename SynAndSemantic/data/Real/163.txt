LINDA WERTHEIMER FINISHES TRIP ACROSS MIDDLE AMERICA 
TODAY LINDA WERTHEIMER COMPLETES HER WEEK OF TRAVELING WEST ALONG ROUTE FIFTY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE NATION 
SHE'S BEEN STOPPING ALONG THE WAY TO TALK TO AMERICANS ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK OF GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT CLINTON'S FIRST THREE MONTHS IN OFFICE 
SHE'S FOUND MOST PEOPLE WANT TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT A CHANCE BUT THEY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND HOW IT AFFECTS THEM 
SHE ALSO MET SOME CHILDREN IN COLORADO WHO DON'T HAVE POLITICS ON THEIR MIND AT ALL 
BUT FIRST A STOP AT A FARM IN KANSAS 
WE'RE JUST OUTSIDE OF HUTCHINSON KANSAS 
WE'VE THE RAINY WEATHER IT WENT EAST AS WE WENT WEST 
THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT IN KANSAS THE LAND IS BLACK THE ROADS ARE STRAIGHT AND THE HORIZON IS A LONG WAY OFF 
BOB BACON FARMS ON EITHER SIDE OF ROUTE FIFTY 
FARMS WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO 
MY FATHER AND I FARM TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF DRY LAND WHEAT MILO OR GRAIN SORGHUM AND CORN 
IN THE WINTER WE DO FEEDER THAT WILL GO TO TO THE FEED LOT IN THE SPRING TIME 
HAVE YOU BEEN MAKING A GOOD LIVING FARMING 
WELL I'VE GOT TWO NICE KIDS AND A NICE WIFE AND A NICE FAMILY BUT FINANCIALLY I WOULD SAY DON'T GO INTO AGRICULTURE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT WASHINGTON AND THE GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON FROM KANSAS WHICH IS THE HOME OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WHITE MARBLE CITY BACK THERE 
OH KIND OF LIVE MOSQUITOES ON A HOT SUMMER DAY THEY CAN SUCK YOU DRY OR THEY CAN LEAVE YOU ALONE SO SOMETIMES I DON'T LIKE WASHINGTON D. C. AT ALL AND THERE'S OTHER TIMES THEIR THEY'RE PROVIDING A VERY VALUABLE ASSET TO US OUT HERE 
DO YOU THINK ABOUT MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON BACK THERE 
OH I THINK OF IT ALL THE TIME 
AGRICULTURE IS A VERY GLOBAL ECONOMY AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IN ARGENTINA WHAT HAPPENS IN RUSSIA HAS A LOT MORE TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS THE NEXT COUNTY OVER 
SO IF WE DON'T HELP RUSSIA WHICH IS A CURRENT TOPIC IN WASHINGTON I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE 
SO I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN WASHINGTON D. C. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON D. C. 
OH POLITICS IS A GAME AND IT'S A GAME THAT HAS TO BE PLAYED 
I WISH WE'D WORK TOGETHER A LITTLE MORE THAN WE DO AT TIMES 
IF WE'D ALL TOGETHER I THINK SOMETIMES WE COULD ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL A LOT FASTER 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER ON 
WHAT ARE THE WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE GET TO 
WELL I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE WANT TO GO 
EVERYBODY THERE'S SO MANY SPECIAL INTEREST ANY MORE AND WE ALL WANT OUR THING 
I WOULD SAY I'M NOT EXUBERANT BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT BILL CLINTON WILL DO THE JOB THAT WE WANT HIM TO DO 
DID YOU VOTE FOR HIM 
YES DON'T TELL ANYBODY 
I'M ON THE REPUBLICAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE HERE IN RENO COUNTY BUT I WAS VERY DISILLUSIONED WITH WHAT GEORGE BUSH WAS DOING SO I VOTED FOR BILL CLINTON 
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT MAKE A HABIT OF DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WELL IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER VOTED DEMOCRAT BUT IF HE DOES A GOOD JOB AND AND FOCUSES ON THE LONG TERM YES I WOULD VOTE FOR BILL CLINTON AGAIN 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
COME ON OUT 
BOB BACON WHO FARMS FOR SIX MILES DID YOU TELL ME 
YEAH EAST OF HUTCHINSON WE FARM ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HIGHWAY FOR ABOUT SIX MILES 
WE HAD BETTER GET BACK ON THAT ROAD AND HEAD WEST 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO COLORADO BEFORE DARK 
YOU'LL MAKE IT EIGHT HOURS 
IT IS JUST ABOUT A DAY'S WORK TO CROSS KANSAS ON ROUTE FIFTY 
AS THE ROAD GOES WEST THE LAND SLIPS OUT TO THE EDGES OF THE SKY AND THE GRAIN ELEVATORS ARE THE LARGEST LANDMARKS BY FAR 
ROUTE FIFTY CROSSES THE ARKANSAS RIVER AND BEGINNING ABOUT DODGE CITY THE ROAD FOLLOWS THE RIVER TO COLORADO WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE NOW 
WE'RE AT THE JOHN MARTIN RESERVOIR 
THERE'S AN IMMENSE DAM BUILT TO CATCH THE WATER OF THE ARKANSAS TO IRRIGATE FARMS TO THE EAST 
BELOW THE DAM THERE'S A CAMPGROUND AND WE FOUND THE FOURTH GRADERS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FROM COLORADO SPRINGS 
THEY'RE HERE FOR A CLASS OUTING 
VISITS TO A MUSEUM AN OLD FORT ON THE SANTA FE TRAIL AND THEY'RE HAVING A CAMP OUT HERE 
THE KIDS HAD CRAFTS AND GAMES UNTIL THE WIND FINALLY DIED DOWN AND THEN THEY DID JUST WHAT WE HOPED THEY WOULD 
THE KIDS HAD ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS ON COAT HANGER WIRES AND WHEN THEY WERE FINALLY PERSUADED INTO THEIR TENTS THEY WANTED GHOST STORIES 
TO US TELLING GHOST STORIES IS KIND OF FUN 
WE SORT OF HAVE ONE ON THE GOLDEN ARM COPS OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S ABOUT GOLDEN WHO LOST MY GOLDEN ARM OR SOMETHING 
IT'S CALLED THE MAN WHO LOST HIS GOLDEN ARM IN THE GRAVEYARD 
YOU LIKE SCARY STORIES 
YEAH I DON'T LIKE TOO SCARY ONES BECAUSE THEN I GET UNDER THE COVERS AND LIKE OOOH DON'T TELL THEM ANY MORE 
AND I GET REALLY SCARED AND I JUST GO TO SLEEP 
WHAT ABOUT YOU

WE DID TALK TO SOME OF THE PARENTS WHO WERE NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE WORLD THEIR KIDS WILL INHERIT AND THOUGH THEY DID SAY THINGS SEEM TO BE GOING PRETTY WELL RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR SCHOOLS AND THEIR JOBS 
WE HEARD THAT KIND OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM FROM MANY PEOPLE ALONG ROUTE FIFTY 
A SENSE THAT SLOWLY THINGS ARE TURNING AROUND 
WE BEGAN THE WEEK IN CHILLICOTHE OHIO AT BREAKFAST IN THE CRISPY CREAM DONUT SHOP TALKING ABOUT JOBS 
ALTHOUGH THE INDUSTRIAL BASE IS NOT WHAT IT WAS IN THE FIFTY'S THERE ARE MORE JOBS THERE NOW THAN THERE WERE LAST YEAR 
IN INDIANA WE MET MAY FLORA WHO HAS NO CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD MAKE HEALTH CARE LESS COSTLY 
BUT SHE IS SURE THAT ANYONE WHO COMES INTO HER BEAUTY SHOP LEAVES LOOKING MUCH BETTER 
DOCTOR BOB EINHORN IN ILLINOIS SAID HE TREASURES PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS PATIENTS AND HOPES HEALTH CARE REFORM WON'T CHANGE THAT 
SITTING AROUND A KITCHEN TABLE IN MISSOURI WE HEARD THAT PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO BE MORE PATIENT WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON THAN POLITICIANS AND THE PRESS HAVE BEEN 
OF PEOPLE TOLD US THAT 
WE'LL REMEMBER PLACES TOO WOODS FILLED WITH RED BUD AND DOGWOOD THE STONE QUARRY WHERE THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING USED TO BE THE USEFUL CEMETERY IN MISSOURI
