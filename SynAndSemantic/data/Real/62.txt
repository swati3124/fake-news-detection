NOW TO THE MAN WITH HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF THE POLLSTERS BILL SCHNEIDER STANDING BY IN WASHINGTON 
BILL STATE POLLS HAVE BEEN COMING OUT 
WHAT ARE YOU READING IN THESE 
WELL CATHERINE THERE HAVE BEEN POLLS PUBLISHED IN THIRTY EIGHT STATES SINCE THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION LAST MONTH 
SO OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON JUST THOSE THIRTY EIGHT STATES 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATES WHERE BILL CLINTON NOW HAS A SOLID LEAD 
CLINTON IS AT LEAST FIFTEEN POINTS AHEAD OF BUSH IN TEN STATES AND THEY INCLUDE SOME BIG ONES 
THREE OF THE NATION'S TEN LARGEST ARE SOLIDLY FOR CLINTON NEW YORK CALIFORNIA AND ILLINOIS 
NOTICE THAT ONLY ONE OF THE SOLID CLINTON STATES HIS OWN STATE OF ARKANSAS IS A SOUTHERN STATE 
TWENTY STATES ARE NOW LEANING TO CLINTON 
ANOTHER FIVE OF THE TEN LARGEST ARE IN THIS LEANING TO CLINTON CATEGORY OHIO NEW JERSEY FLORIDA NORTH CAROLINA AND GEORGE BUSH'S OWN STATE OF TEXAS 
BUSH IS SOLIDLY AHEAD THAT IS BY FIFTEEN POINTS OR MORE IN ONLY ONE STATE UTAH 
BUT UTAH HAS ONLY FIVE ELECTORAL VOTES 
FOUR MORE STATES ARE LEANING TO BUSH 
ONLY ONE OF THEM VIRGINIA HAS MORE THAN TEN ELECTORAL VOTES 
AND THE RACE IS A DEAD HEAT IN THREE STATES 
BILL WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SUPPORT YOU'RE CALLING SOLID FOR BILL CLINTON 
WELL LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS IN THE TOP TEN CLINTON STATES 
RIGHT NOW NEW YORK IS BILL CLINTON'S BEST STATE 
HE'S RUNNING TWENTY SEVEN POINTS AHEAD IN THE EMPIRE STATE 
CLINTON IS RUNNING TWENTY SIX POINTS AHEAD IN FAMOUSLY LIBERAL MASSACHUSETTS TWENTY FIVE POINTS AHEAD IN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST STATE WITH ONE FIFTH OF THE ELECTORAL VOTES HE NEEDS TO WIN 
HE'S RUNNING TWENTY TWO POINTS AHEAD IN HIS OWN STATE OF ARKANSAS AND TWENTY ONE POINTS AHEAD IN LIBERAL MINNESOTA 
THE NEXT FIVE IT'S CLINTON BY NINETEEN IN ILLINOIS THE SIXTH LARGEST STATE CLINTON BY NINETEEN IN OREGON A STATE THAT'S VOTED DEMOCRATIC ONLY ONCE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR FOR DUKAKIS LAST TIME CLINTON BY NINETEEN IN IOWA ANOTHER DUKAKIS STATE 
CLINTON IS LEADING BY SIXTEEN IN RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC HAWAII AND CLINTON BY FIFTEEN IN VERMONT A STATE THAT HAS NOT GONE DEMOCRATIC SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
NOW LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THESE TOP TEN CLINTON STATES ON THE MAP 
ONLY THREE OF THE SOLID CLINTON STATES WERE AMONG JIMMY CARTER'S TOP TEN STATES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN CARTER WON 
BUT SEVEN OF THE SOLID CLINTON STATES WERE AMONG MICHAEL TEN BEST STATES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
NOT ONLY THAT BUT SEVEN OF THE SOLID CLINTON STATES WERE AMONG GEORGE MCGOVERN'S TOP TEN STATES BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO 
IN OTHER WORDS CLINTON IS DOING BEST IN THE SAME STATES WHERE DUKAKIS AND MCGOVERN DID BEST 
NOW CLINTON AND GORE ARE BOTH SOUTHERN WHITE BAPTISTS LIKE JIMMY CARTER 
BUT CARTER THE LAST DEMOCRAT TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY GOT ELECTED ON A SOUTHERN STRATEGY 
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WHAT BILL CLINTON IS DOING 
WELL CAN YOU DEFINE ANY SORT OF COALITION THEN THAT CLINTON SEEMS TO BE PUTTING TOGETHER 
WELL CATHERINE HERE'S SOMETHING ODD 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT CARRIED SEVENTEEN STATES IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY 
EIGHT OF THOSE STATES THAT LINCOLN CARRIED ARE NOW SOLID CLINTON STATES 
THE GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS AND A SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A COALITION THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S 
A COINCIDENCE 
NOT REALLY 
IN ITS EARLY DAYS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS A LIBERAL ANTI SLAVERY PARTY 
IT WAS BUILT ON A BEDROCK OF YANKEE VOTES IN THE NORTHEAST THE UPPER MIDWEST AND THE PACIFIC COAST 
THE NORTHERN LIBERAL VOTE REMAINED THE CORE REPUBLICAN VOTE FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS RIGHT UP UNTIL THE NEW DEAL IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
RIGHT NOW BILL CLINTON IS DOING BEST IN THE NORTHEAST AND ON THE WEST COAST 
THEY ARE THE MOST LIBERAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE TWO COASTS HAVE SUFFERED MOST FROM THE WORST ECONOMIES OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
BUSH IS RUNNING A CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN UNLIKE GERALD FORD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX 
AND BUSH IS RUNNING BEST IN THE SOUTH 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW NORTHERN LIBERAL COALITION 
WE SAW IT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO FOR MCGOVERN AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR DUKAKIS 
BUT THE DEMOCRATS LOST BOTH OF THOSE ELECTIONS 
IF CLINTON WINS THIS YEAR CATHERINE IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THE DEMOCRATS HAVE WON THE PRESIDENCY WITH THIS NEW COALITION 
WELL MAYBE INSTEAD OF THE HARRY TRUMAN ANALOGY WE NEED AN ABE LINCOLN ANALOGY 
YES 
RIGHT 
BILL SCHNEIDER THANKS VERY MUCH 
AND NEXT ON INSIDE POLITICS AND LONG AND MONOTONOUS WAY TO COMMUNITY CLINICS FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION BUT CAN'T AFFORD IT
