THIS IS WEEKEND EDITION 
I'M SCOTT SIMON 
CONGRESS HAD A CHANCE TO DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE DONE BUT IT DIDN'T DO 
IT SHOULD HAVE PASSED SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION MUCH OF WHICH HAS THE SUPPORT OF BOTH AMERICAN PEOPLE AND INDUSTRY AND ENVIRONMENT GROUPS 
IT SHOULD HAVE PASSED HEALTH CARE REFORM INSTEAD OF WATCHING ANOTHER MILLION AMERICANS LOSE THEIR COVERAGE AS THE NEW DATA POINTS OUT HAPPENED JUST LAST YEAR WHILE COSTS INCREASE FASTER THAN INFLATION AND MORE CITIZENS LOSE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR DOCTOR 
AND CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE PASSED POLITICAL REFORM 
PRESIDENT CLINTON EVALUATING THE ONE HUNDRED THIRD CONGRESS AT A WHITE HOUSE NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY 
JOINING US NOW FROM THE STUDIOS OF MEMBER STATION IN PHILADELPHIA TO EVALUATE ALL THE WEEK'S NEWS IS OUR OWN DANIEL SCHORR 
DAN GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING SCOTT 
DAN BEFORE WE PITCH INTO THIS DID YOU SEE THE LARRY KING SLASH MARLON BRANDO INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT 
AFRAID NOT 
WELL IT ENDED WITH LARRY KING AND MARLON BRANDO SINGING BLUE MOON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN TWO OF THEM KISSING EACH OTHER FULL ON THE LIPS AND ALL I COULD THINK OF IS WE GOT A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW THIS MORNING 
ESPECIALLY WITH ME IN PHILADELPHIA 
SO MUCH THE LOSS 
LISTEN LET ME GET IF WE COULD OF COURSE BEGIN WITH THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS 
HE SAID THIS CONGRESS HAD SOME EARLY ACHIEVEMENTS BUT FINISHED WITH A RECORD THAT HE THOUGHT CERTAINLY LEFT VERY LITTLE SOURCE OF PRIDE 
PERHAPS HE BLAMED THE REPUBLICANS 
FROM THE HALF CENTURY YOU'VE SPENT OBSERVING POLITICS AND CONGRESS HOW GOOD OR BAD WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS CONGRESS 
WELL IN THE FORTY YEARS THAT I'VE SEEN CONGRESS CERTAINLY THIS IS MOST DISMAL OF A CONGRESS I'VE EVER SEEN IN A FLURRY OF A KIND OF A PROUD ASSERTION OF DO NOTHING AS A WAY OF LIFE 
ONE RESOLUTION THEY SPEND A DAY ON TELLING PRESIDENT CLINTON TO GET OUT OF HAITI IN A PROMPT AND ORDERLY FASHION AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE PLANNING TO GET OUT IN A FASHION AND STAY FOREVER AND THEN NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO ATTACK THE G. A. T. T. AGREEMENT WHICH HAD A LOT OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 
SO THEY'LL HAVE TO COME BACK FOR A LAME DUCK SESSION WHICH MEANS THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE VOTING ON IT ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN REJECTED BY THEIR CONSTITUENTS 
I GUESS BLAMING THE OTHER PARTY OF COURSE IS NOT AN UNEXPECTED TURN BUT IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT MANY LEADING REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN I MEAN I'M ALMOST AS PROUD OF THEIR ABILITY TO BLOCK SOMETHING ON THE FRONT LINE OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS 
AND NOW OF COURSE THEY SAY THAT HAS BEEN A BAD LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE IS NOW RESPONDING O. K. WE'LL TAKE IT TO THE PEOPLE NEXT MONTH 
WELL THAT'S RIGHT 
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMEBODY HAS MISCALCULATED VERY BADLY 
EITHER THE REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE THAT A DO NOTHING CONGRESS IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT OR THE PRESIDENT WHO'S NOW READY GO OUT AND MAKE AN ISSUE OF IT 
IF NOTHING ELSE THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW DEFINED THE ISSUE AND HE'S HELPED TO NATIONALIZE A MIDTERM NON NATIONAL ELECTION 
HE HAS RESTATED THE GOALS ABOUT JOBS AND INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION WHICH IN EFFECT IS ASKING AMERICANS WHETHER DO NOTHING IS WHAT THEY REALLY WANT 
THIS IS A BOLD THING THE PRESIDENT'S DOING 
HE'S VERY UNPOPULAR AND HE'S COMING AND SAYING I KNOW I'M UNPOPULAR AND I KNOW DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE AWAY FROM ME AND YET SAYING I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS ELECTION ABOUT ME AND ABOUT MY PROGRAM AND JUST GO AHEAD AND MAKE MY DAY 
WELL WILL AMERICA TAKE TO THIS GIVE THEM 'EM HARRY CLINTON 
WE'LL SEE 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT TWO YEARS AGO IT SEEMED FAIR TO CONCLUDE THAT THE AMERICAN THE AMERICAN VOTING PUBLIC WAS SAYING WE WANT CHANGE AND NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT IS SKEPTICAL OF CHANGE 
WELL HAS THE MOOD CHANGED OR JUST THE WAY WE READ A CHANGE 
WELL CHANGE WAS THE BIG MOTIF OF THE CLINTON NINETEEN NINETY TWO CAMPAIGN 
AND NOW THE QUESTION IS IF HE WAS AN AGENT OF CHANGE DO THEY WANT CHANGE 
MAYBE THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE POLICIES 
WE JUST WANT TO CHANGE A LOT OF FACES AND GET RID OF ALL OF THOSE WITH KNOWN RECORDS AND BRING ON THOSE WHO HAVE A VIRTUE OF HAVING NO TRACK RECORDS OF ALL 
IF THAT IS TRUE IT TENDS TO FAVOR THE EMPTY SUITS ESPECIALLY THE EMPTY SUITS WITH DEEP POCKETS 
LET ME ASK THE NAME COLIN POWELL OF COURSE IS NEWLY PROMINENT IN FIGURING IN THE FUTURE POLITICS OF THIS COUNTRY 
HE IS CERTAINLY NO EMPTY SUIT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE DEEP POCKETS 
ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAS NO DISCERNIBLE RECORD 
WE READ AN ARTICLE YESTERDAY OR I GUESS ON THURSDAY IN THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE WHERE HE APPEARED AT THE FRANKFURT BOOK FAIR AND SEEMED TO SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME EXPLICITLY THAT HE WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR POLITICAL SERVICE 
HE SAYS I DO WANT TO RETURN TO SOME KIND OF SERVICE TO MY COUNTRY 
WELL THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE THAT STEVE FOUND IN THE HERALD TRIBUNE AND INDEED IT CERTAINLY TAKES GENERAL POWELL A LOT FURTHER THAN HE'S YET GONE ANYWHERE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAPERS BACK IN THIS COUNTRY 
THERE HE WAS AT A DINNER OF ALL PLACES AT THE FRANKFURT GERMANY BOOK FAIR AND HE'S QUOTED THERE AS SAYING THAT FUTURE SERVICE MIGHT BE POLITICAL AND HE MIGHT ACCEPT A NOMINATION AND THAT HE'S BEGINNING TO GET USED TO THE FEELING OF BEING ELECTABLE HOW ABOUT THAT AND THAT HE HASN'T YET DEVELOPED A POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE HE HASN'T NEEDED ONE SO FAR 
AND THAT OF COURSE IS INTERESTING 
AND THEN HE THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS HE'S GONE TO SAY THAT HE'S AVAILABLE AS A REPUBLICAN AS A DEMOCRAT AS AN INDEPENDENT OR WHAT 
I'LL TELL YOU WITH THE GENERAL ALIENATION OF AMERICANS ABOUT ARE ESTABLISHED PARTIES THE FIELD WAS NOW NEVER MORE FERTILE FOR AN INDEPENDENT 
AND IT SEEMS SINCE AMERICAN SEEMS TO BE TURNED OFF ON ALL KNOWN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHIES THERE MAY BE JUST AN ADVANTAGE IN HAVING AN EISENHOWER TYPE WHO SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OR AT LEAST NOT YET 
DAN LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE LATEST FIGURES ON THE ECONOMY THAT CAME OUT WHICH CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT DESPITE ECONOMIC GROWTH THERE IS INCREASING POVERTY IN THIS COUNTRY 
OF COURSE PRESIDENT CLINTON ALLUDED TO THAT PROBLEM YESTERDAY AND THE OF THOSE TWO FIGURES 
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S THE GREAT PARADOX OF AMERICA 
EMPLOYMENT GOES UP AND POVERTY GOES UP TO THIRTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION AMERICANS 
AND BY THE WAY POVERTY HOW'S IT DEFINED 
TO BE POOR YOU HAVE TO HAVE UNDER FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR 
SO POOR IS REALLY POOR 
WELL PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS YOU KNOW THEY'RE MORE LOW PAYING JOBS NOT ENOUGH HIGH PAID JOBS NOT ENOUGH EDUCATION TRAINING FOR BETTER PAID SKILLS 
HE SAYS IT'S A TWENTY YEAR TREND AGGRAVATED DURING THE REAGAN AND BUSH YEARS 
BUT NOW A BUDGET WARY ADMINISTRATION AND A DO NOTHING CONGRESS AND WHAT 
THE TREND IS THERE AND NOT MUCH IS HAPPENING TO REVERSE THAT TREND 
THE NEWS FROM IRAQ THIS MORNING IS THAT WHATEVER ADVANCE OF TANK COLUMNS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING TOWARDS THE BORDER WITH KUWAIT HAS APPARENTLY STOPPED 
BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT JUST AS THE U. N. IS CONTEMPLATING LIFTING SANCTIONS THERE APPARENTLY HAS BEEN THIS MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE BORDER OF A COUPLE OF IRAQI TANK DIVISIONS 
WELL MAYBE IT'S A KIND OF BLUFF TO TRY TO FORCE THEM TO LIFT THE SANCTIONS 
WE DON'T KNOW YET 
SOME FAMOUS LAST WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO SADDAM HUSSEIN IS HE WOULDN'T DARE ATTACK RIGHT 
SO MAYBE IT'S A BLUFF 
IT MAYBE NOT AND I'D BE THE LAST ONE TO TRY TO PREDICT MAYBE HE THINKS ONCE AGAIN AS HE ONCE TOLD AMBASSADOR APRIL THAT AMERICANS PRIZE THEIR LIVES TOO HIGHLY TO RISK THEM IN A WAR 
HE LEARNED THAT WASN'T TRUE THEN 
IS HE WILLING TO TRY IT AGAIN 
DOES HE LOOK AT SOMALIA AND BOSNIA AND THE CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURE TO GET OUT OF HAITI AND SAY O. K. NOW MAYBE I CAN TRY 
IS HE READY FOR ANOTHER MISCALCULATION 
WE'LL SOON KNOW 
EVENTS IN HAITI THIS WEEK THE NEWLY RESTORED HAITIAN PARLIAMENT HAS APPROVED AN AMNESTY PLAN BUT ONE THAT POINTEDLY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO'VE LED THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND AUTHORIZED OR BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS CRIMES 
IS THIS GOING TO IS THIS GOING TO MAKE JUST ALL THE MORE ATTRACTIVE AND URGENT FOR GENERAL CEDRAS TO LEAVE 
WELL ONE WOULD THINK SO 
THIS AMNESTY IS CAREFULLY DEFINED AS BEING LIMITED TO POLITICAL ACTS AND THAT MEANS SUPPORTING THE COUP THAT UNSEATED PRESIDENT ARISTIDE AND NOT CRIMES AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE RAPES AND KILLINGS AND TORTURES THAT WENT ON 
AND THAT MEANS THAT IF GENERAL CEDRAS AND HIS PEOPLE STAY IN HAITI PAST A WEEK FROM NOW THEY ARE IN PERIL OF ARREST AND TRIAL 
THIS ISN'T QUITE WHAT PRESIDENT CARTER PROMISED THESE PEOPLE WHEN HE CALLED THEM MEN OF HONOR BUT I THINK WE'RE NOW NEARING THE CRUNCH WEEK IN HAITI 
AND A STORY THAT BURST TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK WAS THAT APPARENTLY THE MAN WHO LED A GROUP OF THUGS THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS DETERRED U. S. AND CANADIAN ENGINEERS FROM LANDING ON THE DOCKS OF PORT AU PRINCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TURNS OUT TO BE HAVE BEEN A PAID C. I. A. INFORMANT 
YEAH THE C. I. A. NEEDS RIGHT NOW ONE MORE SCANDAL 
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY NEED RIGHT NOW 
THIS IS THEY WAY THE C. I. A. OVER THE YEARS HAS ACTED 
IT LOVES TO WORK WITH GENERALS AND NOT WITH THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE LIKE LIBERATION PRIESTS AND ALL OF THAT 
IT'S NORIEGA ALL OVER AGAIN 
NORIEGA WORKED FOR THE C. I. A. 
NORIEGA BECAME AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES AND ENDED UP IN JAIL 
AND SO WHY NOT HAITI AS WELL 
AND DOES THIS FINALLY RAISE THE QUESTION AS TO IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DISTANCE BETWEEN WHAT THE U. S. HAS BROKERED THERE BY WAY OF A FORMAL AGREEMENT AND THEN HOW EVENTS ARE GOING TO FINALLY BREAK 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I MEAN THE WAY EVENTS ARE NOW GOING TO BREAK IS NOW WE NOW HAVE ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET AND THAT BASKET IS ARISTIDE 
O. K. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
