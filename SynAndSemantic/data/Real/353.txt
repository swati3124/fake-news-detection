JOINING US NOW WITH SOME INSIGHTS ON THE U. S. STOCK MARKET AND HOW IT'LL AFFECT EUROPE AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IS JOE MCALINDEN 
HE'S THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT DILLON READ 
THANKS FOR JOINING US JOE 
GOOD TO BE HERE 
FIRST LET'S START A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF OBVIOUSLY FOR THE BOND MARKET AND THE STOCK MARKET 
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE 
I THINK WE'RE ENTERING THE EYE OF THE HURRICANE 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PERIOD OF A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHERE BONDS DO BETTER AND STOCKS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL RALLY INTO THE MID SUMMER 
WHY ARE YOU EXPECTING AN IMPROVEMENT GIVEN THAT HIGHER INTEREST RATES HURT THE ECONOMY AND PRESUMABLY THE COMPANIES 
THEY DO BUT THE THING THAT HURTS STOCKS THE MOST IS CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY 
WHEN INTEREST RATES HELP STOCKS IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE FALLING AND WHEN IT HURTS STOCKS ITS BECAUSE THEY'RE RISING 
AND THEY'VE NOW RISEN AND I THINK THAT NOW FOR A WHILE THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS GOING TO BE THAT THE FED IS DONE WITH TIGHTENING AND THE BOND MARKET HAS MADE ITS ADJUSTMENTS 
AND THAT'S BEHIND US NOW 
WHY IS IT DO YOU THINK THAT THE DOLLAR HAS FAILED TO RALLY ON THE RISE IN INTEREST RATES 
DOES IT REFLECT A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FED OR THE U. S. GOVERNMENT 
I THINK IT'S A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE CURRENCY 
I THINK THIS IS REALLY THE HEART OF THE ISSUE 
THE REASON I THINK THAT IN FACT THE MARKET WILL BE LOWER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR IS THAT IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT THAT THERE REALLY IS AN INFLATION PROBLEM 
I BELIEVE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADERS HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT AND THAT'S WHY THE DOLLARS BEEN WEEK ALL ALONG AND WHY IT PROBABLY WON'T RESPOND THAT MUCH TO THESE TIGHTENING MOVES 
WHAT HAPPENS IF IT DOESN'T BOUNCE BACK 
WE'RE AT A STAGE NOW WHERE IT'S DOWN AGAIN IN EUROPE AFTER THE RATE HIKES YESTERDAY 
AS LONG AS THE DOLLAR DOESN'T GO INTO A FREE FALL I THINK WE CAN GET THIS TEMPORARY CALMING AND AN EARLY SUMMER RALLY 
I'M HOPING THAT THE DOLLAR 
I DON'T EXPECT A BIG RALLY THOUGH ON THE DOLLAR 
LET'S TALK INVESTMENT ADVICE IF WE CAN 
IF I'VE GOT SOME MONEY TO INVEST WHERE SHOULD I BE PUTTING IT 
IN CASH BONDS STOCKS 
IF YOU HAVE A FIVE YEAR INVESTMENT HORIZON I THINK STOCKS ARE STARTING TO LOOK INTERESTING 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE UNHAPPY THAT YOU BOUGHT THEM TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE LOWER IN NOVEMBER THEN YOU SHOULD STAY IN CASH BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT AFTER A SHORT EARLY SUMMER RALLY OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POINTS ON THE DOW THE MARKET WILL TRADE LOWER AND MAKE A NEW LOW IN THE FALL 
WHAT ABOUT THE BOND MARKET 
WE SAW INTEREST RATES IN THE BOND MARKET FALL AND THE PRICES RISE SIGNIFICANTLY YESTERDAY 
IF FOLKS BELIEVE THE FED HAS TAMED INFLATION THEN BOND YIELDS MIGHT COME DOWN EVEN MORE 
I THINK THE BOND YIELD COULD MOVE TOWARD SEVEN PERCENT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT I'M TELLING THAT THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE MONEY AND SELL SOME DEBT AND BUYERS TO BE VERY CAREFUL 'CAUSE I THINK RATES WILL GO HIGHER NEXT YEAR 
YOU THINK WHEN THAT INFLATION PROBLEM SHOWS UP WE'RE GOING TO SEE BOND MARKETS TAKE RATES HOW HIGH 
I THINK THAT NEXT YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE LONG BOND UP IN THE EIGHT TO EIGHT AND A HALF RANGE 
CAN WE FOR THE LONG TERM PLAYERS YOU SAID FIVE YEARS' IF YOU'VE GOT A SOLID GUT FOR THIS 
WHAT DO YOU BUY RIGHT NOW 
I BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IS GOING TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY A VERY STRONG PERFORMANCE BY BASIC AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES PARTICULARLY INDUSTRIAL MATERIAL COMPANIES AND ENERGY 
SO I WOULD SHIFT TOWARDS RESOURCE BASED EQUITIES AND AWAY FROM INTEREST AND CONSUMER GROWTH COMPANIES 
BANKS AND FINANCIAL COMPANIES' STOCKS I BELIEVE RALLIED YESTERDAY ON THE FED'S MOVE 
THAT SURPRISE YOU 
WELL I THINK THEY'LL RALLY SOME MORE 
THE NEGATIVE RAP ON BANKS HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME THAT THEIR SPREADS WERE GOING TO BE CONTRACTING 
BUT NOW IT'S TURNING OUT THAT THEY'RE RAISING THEIR WHAT THEY CHARGE JUST AS FAST AS THEIR COST OF BORROWING IS GOING UP SO THE SPREADS LOOK O. K. TEMPORARILY 
ALL RIGHT 
SO THE ADVICE IS BASICALLY BUY STOCKS NOW OR WAIT 'TIL NOVEMBER WHEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THEM A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER 
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN TIME IT RIGHT BUY THEM IN NOVEMBER AND YOU COULD GET VERY GOOD RETURNS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS 
JOSEPH MCALINDEN OF DILLON READ THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE
