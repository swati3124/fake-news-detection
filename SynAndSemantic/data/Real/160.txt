OVER THE SPAN OF A QUARTER CENTURY MORE THAN THREE MILLION AMERICANS SERVED A TOUR OF DUTY IN VIETNAM 
THIS WALL NOW SO FAMILIAR TO MOST HOLDS THE NAMES OF FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THE DEAD AND THE MISSING 
ONLY THE CIVIL WAR DIVIDED THIS NATION MORE THAN DID VIETNAM 
IT WAS A WAR THE U. S. DID NOT WIN COULD NOT WIN 
THE LAST AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS LEFT VIETNAM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE 
SAIGON THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE CAPITOL FELL ON APRIL THIRTIETH NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
THIS NATION CONTINUED TO OVER THAT UNPOPULAR WAR 
AMERICAN SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WOULD FIGHT AND DIE IN COMBAT AGAIN GRANADA PANAMA LITTLE BATTLES AND IN ONE BIG NOISY BUT MERCIFULLY SHORT WAR IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
IT'S LONG OVERDUE 
IT IS LONG OVERDUE THAT WE KICK THE VIETNAM SYNDROME 
PERHAPS THE MILITARY KICKED THE VIETNAM SYNDROME ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF IRAQ BUT NOT ALL AMERICANS HAVE 
I'M CHARLES BIERBAUER 
THIS REPORT IS ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELDS AND PRISON CAMPS OF THE MIND 
AFTER A BREAK FOR NEWS HEADLINES WE'LL MEET FAMILIES OF THE MISSING VETERANS WHOSE LIVES ARE MISSING MORE THAN LIMBS AS WE EXAMINE THE LINGERING VIETNAM SYNDROME 
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR CAME HOME AFTER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE PEACE AGREEMENT BUT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR 
FOR YEARS REPORTS OR RUMORS HAVE PERSISTED 
WERE THE VIETNAMESE STILL HOLDING AMERICANS ALIVE 
EARLIER THIS MONTH A REPORT UNCOVERED IN MOSCOW SUGGESTED VIETNAM MAY HAVE HELD HUNDREDS MORE PRISONERS THAN IT EVER ADMITTED 
U. S. OFFICIALS NOW DOUBT THAT BUT M. I. A. FAMILIES HAVE TO HOPE 
JEFF FLOCK VISITED THE FAMILY OF NAVY LIEUTENANT DANIEL IN LE ROY ILLINOIS 
NAVY FLYER DAN JUNIOR NINETEEN SEVENTY PRISONER DAN JUNIOR NINETEEN NINETY AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HIS FAMILY THINKS 
I WEAR THIS BRACELET AND I LOOK AT THAT PICTURE A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY AND I KNOW THAT'S HIM 
IT'S NOT HIM SAYS THE U. S. GOVERNMENT 
DAN IS BELIEVED TO BE DEAD 
WE WERE LIED TO BY OUR GOVERNMENT FROM THE MOMENT DAN WAS SHOT DOWN 
THE STRANGE CASE OF DAN DEMONSTRATES THE DOUBT THAT STILL EXISTS ABOUT WHETHER U. S. SERVICEMEN REMAIN CAPTIVE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND IT DEMONSTRATES THE ALWAYS DOGGED SOMETIMES BLIND ZEAL OF FAMILIES SEARCHING FOR THEIR MISSING LOVED ONES EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO APPARENT EVIDENCE THEY ARE ALIVE 
WE BEGIN OUR STORY WITH DAN SENIOR 
AFTER THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY HAD BEEN KILLED WE JUST ACCEPTED IT 
YOU BELIEVED THEM 
WE BELIEVED THEM 
BUT NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AFTER DAN JUNIOR'S PLANE WAS HIT OVER SOUTH VIETNAM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THESE PHOTOS EMERGED FROM THE LAOTIAN JUNGLE AND THE LIVES CHANGED FOREVER 
MY HEART FELL TO MY FEET 
I GOT CHILLS AND MY HAIR STOOD UP ON END 
AND THEN I SAID MY GOD THAT'S DAN 
ARMED WITH THE PHOTOS U. S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATORS WENT TO LAOS TO FIND THE MAN IN THE PICTURES 
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD NATIVE NAMED MR. 
THE INVESTIGATORS BROUGHT BACK PICTURES OF HIM AND THEM 
END OF CASE NOT FOR THE 
THEY SAY WELL THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER AND YOU JUST GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU DON'T BELIEVE A WORD THEY SAY 
DAN SENIOR BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT PICTURES WERE FAKES SO THE FAMILY SENT BROTHERS CHRIS AND JIM TO LAOS TO FIND AND PHOTOGRAPH THE MAN THEMSELVES 
I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO SEE ANYBODY 
WE JUST FIGURED THE MAN HE WAS GOING TO GET SICK OR DIE OR DISAPPEAR OR SOMETHING 
BUT THEN HE TURNED UP 
AND AS THE TAPE THEY SHOWED TO US DEMONSTRATES IT WAS NOT THEIR BROTHER 
MR. CONFIRMED THAT HE WAS THE MAN WERE CONVINCED WAS THEIR BROTHER 
WE SAY THAT THEY HAD TO COACH HIM 
THEY WILL NOT GIVE UP BELIEVING THAT THIS IS DAN AND THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE 
THEY'VE SPENT MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HIRING PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS PHOTO EXPERTS FINGERPRINT ANALYSTS 
WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR QUITE SOME TIME WITH TWO PSYCHICS 
YOU'LL TRY ANYTHING BY GOLLY 
IN TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS THE GOVERNMENT SUGGESTS THAT THE PHOTOS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF CRUEL ACTIONS BY FAST OPERATORS WHO PLAY ON THE HOPES OF FAMILIES OF P. O. W.S AND M. I. A.S TO MAKE MONEY FAMILIES DESPERATE TO HEAR A LOVED ONE IS STILL ALIVE 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY SOME PEOPLE SAY 
WELL YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST GRASPING AT STRAWS 
THEY WANT TO BELIEVE THE MAN'S ALIVE 
YEAH WELL I HEAR THAT QUITE A BIT 
AND YOU KNOW DO I REALLY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S BEEN HELD IN CAPTIVITY FOR TWENTY YEARS 
THE SAY WHATEVER HAPPENED THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO 
THEY SAY THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY TOLD THEIR SON WAS DEAD WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAD INFORMATION HE MADE IT TO THE GROUND ALIVE AND WAS TAKEN PRISONER 
BUT THEY'VE GOT YOU TO THE POINT NOW THAT THEY JUST YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN 
SO THEY TURN TO WHAT SOME SEE AS A CRUSADE THE PINS BRACELETS BUTTONS THE FLAGS THAT KEEP DAN ALIVE AT HOME WHEN MANY BELIEVE HE IS DEAD HALF A WORLD AWAY 
NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN 
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE HIM BEFORE THE PICTURES CAME OUT 
SO EVEN IF IT'D DIE RIGHT NOW AND NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAPPEN WE HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING 
I'M JEFF FLOCK C. N. N. IN LE ROY ILLINOIS 
WHILE THE M. I. A. FAMILIES WAIT FOR THAT FINAL HOMECOMING MANY VIETNAM VETERANS WHO SURVIVED THEIR TOUR FIND THEY ONLY MADE IT PART WAY HOME AND LIVE NOW IN A LIMBO OF MENTAL ANGUISH AND BUREAUCRATIC FATIGUE
