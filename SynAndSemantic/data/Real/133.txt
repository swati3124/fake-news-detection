JAPAN'S STOCK MARKET TODAY SOARED MORE THAN FOUR PERCENT AFTER ECONOMIC MINISTERS APPROVED A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR STIMULUS PACKAGE TO JUMP START JAPAN'S WEAK ECONOMY 
THAT NEW SPENDING ON PUBLIC WORKS COULD DOUBLE THE COUNTRY'S GROWTH RATE THIS YEAR 
IT MAY WELL HELP EASE GROWING TRADE TENSIONS AS WELL 
KATHLEEN BEHOF REPORTS FROM TOKYO 
SIGNS OF RECOVERY ARE APPEARING SO DOES A PICKUP IN AUTO SALES AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION 
THE GROWTH IS FALLING FAR SHORT OF THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE TARGET OF THREE POINT THREE PERCENT AND CONSUMER SPENDING REMAINS WEAK 
IF THE PUBLIC READS ABOUT THIS PACKAGE AND CERTAINLY THERE IS ENOUGH PUBLICITY THAT EVERYONE IN JAPAN KNOWS THAT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF EMERGENCY ACTION TAKEN ON THE ECONOMY HOPEFULLY CONSUMERS WILL BEGIN SPENDING ONCE AGAIN AND THAT WILL BE THE PERFECT SOLUTION 
THE STIMULUS PACKAGE INCLUDES SPENDING ON A HUGE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT FOR ROADS PARKS AND SEWER SYSTEMS 
IT PROVIDES TAX BREAKS FOR HOUSING LOANS EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES AND INVESTMENTS BY SMALL BUSINESS 
THERE IS ALSO MONEY FOR WHAT'S BEING CALLED A NEW SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
JAPAN PLANS TO BUILD AN ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER NETWORK THAT WILL BE USED BY SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES HOSPITALS AND GOVERNMENT RESEARCH LABS 
THE HIGH TECH COMMUNICATIONS SPENDING COULD BE A BOON FOR COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY COULD GET A SHOT AT BIDDING FOR SOME OF THOSE CONTRACTS 
GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGICAL POSITION THAT A LOT OF THE U. S. COMPANIES HAVE IN THAT AREA I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IS A PRETTY RIPE AREA FOR GETTING SOME SHARE OF THE INVESTMENT GOING INTO THAT 
IN FACT THE TIMING OF THE STIMULUS PACKAGE IS SAID TO BE CONNECTED TO THE MEETING SCHEDULED LATER THIS WEEK BETWEEN PRESIDENT CLINTON AND JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA 
A BOOST IN CONSUMER SPENDING HERE COULD STIMULATE IMPORTS OF U. S. GOODS 
WHILE U. S. COMPANIES COULD GET A CHANCE TO MAKE INROADS INTO THE JAPANESE MARKET 
BOTH COULD HELP EASE THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN AND COOL DOWN THE TOUGH TRADE TALK COMING FROM WASHINGTON 
KATHLEEN BEHOF C. N. N. BUSINESS NEWS TOKYO 
THE LATEST TRADE NUMBERS FROM JAPAN WON'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP EASE TRADE TENSIONS JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH THIRTY FIRST SURGED TO A RECORD ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS UP MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR ITS SURPLUS WITH THE U. S. JUMPING ALMOST TWENTY PERCENT FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS QUITE A SHARP INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE YEN AGAINST THE DOLLAR
