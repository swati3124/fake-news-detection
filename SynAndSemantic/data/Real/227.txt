WHAT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR MANY AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW THE U. S. MILITARY WITH ALL ITS ADVANCED WEAPONRY AND SEEMINGLY HIGHLY TRAINED SOLDIERS CAN BE DENIED VICTORY BY WHAT ON THE SURFACE LOOKS LIKE A RAG TAG ARMY 
AS OUR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT BOB ZELNICK REPORTS IT IS COMPLICATED 
THE TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS LOADED FOR THE FLIGHT TO SOMALIA ARE MEANT TO COME QUICKLY TO THE RESCUE OF ANY TROOPS UNDER ATTACK IN ANY PART OF MOGADISHU DAY OR NIGHT 
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INCREASE THE FORCE IN ANY LARGE WAY AT THIS POINT 
WE'RE JUST RESPONDING TO AN IMMEDIATE NEED 
THAT RESPONSE COMES TOO LATE FOR THE FORCES ATTACKED OVER THE WEEKEND BY GENERAL AIDID'S MILITIAMEN 
IT TOOK MORE THAN NINE HOURS FOR RELIEF FORCES TO FIGHT THEIR WAY TO THE SCENE 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE LIGHTLY ARMED U. S. QUICK REACTION TROOPS WERE BLOCKED BY HEAVY FIRE AND HAD TO WAIT FOR ALLIED TANK REINFORCEMENTS 
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD A. B. C. NEWS THAT A REQUEST FOR ARMORED EQUIPMENT EARLY LAST MONTH WAS SIDETRACKED BECAUSE THE PENTAGON DID NOT WANT TO BE SEEN TO BE BUILDING UP U. S. FORCES IN THE COUNTRY 
THE ARMORED EQUIPMENT IS NECESSARY PARTLY BECAUSE HELICOPTERS ARE PROVING EASY TARGETS FOR GUERRILLAS WHO ARE NOW USING CONVERTED ARTILLERY GUNS AND ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADES AGAINST THEM 
PRIVATELY U. S. OFFICIALS PAINT AN INCREASINGLY BLEAK PICTURE OF SECURITY IN SOUTH MOGADISHU 
MUCH OF THE AREA IS EITHER CONTROLLED BY AIDID'S GUNMEN OR BITTERLY CONTESTED 
THEY SAY THAT AIDID ALSO CONTROLS A LARGE TRIANGULAR AREA OF CENTRAL SOMALIA FROM WHERE HE IS ABLE TO SECURE STEADY REINFORCEMENTS OF TROOPS AND WEAPONS 
INCREASINGLY MILITARY LEADERS SAY THAT RESTORING SECURITY IN MOGADISHU COULD REQUIRE A COMMITMENT FAR BEYOND WHAT PUBLIC OPINION WOULD SUPPORT 
PRIVATELY MANY HOPE FOR A POLITICAL DEAL WITH AIDID'S CLAN RATHER THAN ESCALATING THE FIGHTING
