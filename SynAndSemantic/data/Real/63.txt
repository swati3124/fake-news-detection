WELCOME BACK TO C. N. N.'S CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE TRIAL THE CASE FILED BY TWELVE YEAR OLD GREGORY KINGSLEY SEEKING TO TERMINATE THE PARENTAL RIGHTS OF HIS MOTHER RACHEL KINGSLEY 
ON THE STAND RIGHT NOW A MAN NAMED ROBERT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES IN FLORIDA 
IN SOME STATES THAT WOULD BE THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES 
MR. IS A CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILY SUPERVISOR AND HE'S HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE KINGSLEY CASE 
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ASKING HIM TO LOOK AT SOME DOCUMENTS 
MR. TAKES THE STAND AFTER THREE WOMEN TOOK THE STAND THEY WERE THREE WAITRESSES WHO HAD WORKED WITH RACHEL KINGSLEY AT VARIOUS TIMES THEY HAD TESTIFIED THAT SHE OFTEN LEFT HER CHILDREN ALONE THAT SHE APPARENTLY HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM ONE TESTIFIED THAT SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF AND THAT SHE WAS FIRED ALLEGEDLY FOR STEALING MONEY FROM THE BAR AT A BAR WHERE SHE WORKED 
ONE WAITRESS THOUGH TESTIFIED THAT RACHEL KINGSLEY WAS A NICE GIRL AND THAT PEOPLE LIKED HER BUT SHE DID DRINK EXCESSIVELY 
THE WHOLE POINT OF COURSE IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GREGORY LAWYERS WHO ARE TRYING TO SHOW THAT RACHEL KINGSLEY IS AN UNFIT MOTHER 
NOW WE'LL TRY TO HEAR WHAT ROBERT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES HAS TO SAY SINCE HE APPARENTLY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE KINGSLEY CASE 
IS THERE A SECTION IN YOUR FILE ON THESE REPORTS 
YES 
IF YOU REVIEW THAT THAT WOULD HELP YOU 
IS THERE ANY AGREEMENT ON THIS 
JUST THE DATE 
JULY OF EIGHTY NINE 
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT GREGORY KINGSLEY WAS PLACED WITH HIS MOTHER IN APPROXIMATELY MARCH OR APRIL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE 
YES 
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT WAS BEFORE THE H. R. S. HAD ITS FIRST CONTACT WITH MRS. KINGSLEY AFTER HER CHILD HAD BEEN PLACE OR GREGORY HAD BEEN PLACED WITH HER 
AFTER GREGORY WAS PLACED WITH HER THE DEPARTMENT WAS INVOLVED WITH THE FAMILY THROUGH VOLUNTARY FAMILY SERVICES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER PLACEMENT OF THE CHILD WITH THEM 
HOW DID IT COME ABOUT THAT VOLUNTARY FAMILY SERVICES BECAME INVOLVED WITH THE FAMILY 
SINCE THE CHILD WAS PLACED IN AN ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK THE MOTHER REQUEST THE VOLUNTARY SERVICES THAT HELPS WITH MAINTAINING HER CHILDREN AND HER FAMILY 
MAY I APPROACH THE WITNESS 
YES YOU MAY 
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A DOCUMENT 
YES 
IS THIS THE DOCUMENT THAT'S KEPT IN YOUR FILE 
YES MA'AM 
WHAT IS IT 
THIS IS AN ABUSE REPORT REGARDING THE FINAL INVESTIGATION 
THEY A REPORT WAS RECEIVED REGARDING 
YOUR HONOR I'M GOING TO OBJECT AT THIS POINT 
I BELIEVE THAT'S HEARSAY INFORMATION 
I REALIZE IT'S A PART OF THE FILE KEPT IN THE BUSINESS RECORDS BUT I THINK THAT THE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE 
IT'S MY CONTENTION THAT THE PREJUDICIAL EFFECT TOWARD MY CLIENT WOULD OUTWEIGH ITS APPROPRIATE VALUE 
ACTUALLY YOUR HONOR I JUST WANTED TO USE THE DOCUMENT TO REFRESH MR. MEMORY SO HE DOESN'T AS LONG AS HE CAN JUST TESTIFY THAT THAT'S HOW THE DEPARTMENT GOT INVOLVED I BELIEVE THAT THAT INDICATES THAT THAT'S HOW THE DEPARTMENT BEGAN VOLUNTEERING SERVICES 
SORT OF LIKE A RADIO CALL TO A POLICE CARE TO GO TO A CERTAIN LOCATION 
THAT TYPE OF THING 
IT'S NOT EVIDENCE 
YES SIR 
I WON'T CONSIDER IT AS EVIDENCE 
WE DON'T HAVE A JURY 
NUMBER 
ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN 
DO YOU RECALL HOW THE DEPARTMENT GOT BECAME INVOLVED WITH MRS. KINGSLEY AFTER THE CHILD WAS PLACED WITH HER 
THERE WAS A CALL CALLED INTO THE ABUSE REGISTRY IN WHICH AN INVESTIGATOR WAS SENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE 
DON'T SAY WHAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS ABOUT THEN AND THAT'S HOW IT GOT INVOLVED 
GO AHEAD AND ASK ANOTHER QUESTION 
AND WHEN DID THAT OCCUR 
JUNE OF EIGHTY NINE 
AND AFTER THE AFTER JUNE OF EIGHTY NINE DID THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE SERVICES TO MRS. KINGSLEY 
YES MA'AM 
WHAT SERVICES WERE PROVIDED 
VOLUNTARY FAMILY SERVICES 
IN REVIEWING YOUR FILE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT SERVICES DURING THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY 
THERE WAS HOMEMAKER SERVICES INVOLVED IN THE HOME 
WHO WAS THE HOMEMAKER 
TERRY THE HOMEMAKER 
DID SHE GO TO MRS. HOME TO TRY TO HELP HER TO OBTAIN VARIOUS SERVICES 
YES MA'AM 
WHAT ELSE WAS DONE 
THE HOMEMAKER 
YES 
HOMEMAKER MADE REFERRALS TO APPROPRIATE SOCIAL SERVICES HELPED HER WITH PARENTING SKILLS TRIED TO HELP HER FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING MAINTAIN HER INCOME IMPROVE HER SELF ESTEEM HELP BUDGET MONEY 
DID MRS. KINGSLEY HAVE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS THROUGH H. R. S. DURING THIS PERIOD 
THE MADE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITH THE MOTHER IN HER HOME AND THERE'S A CASEWORKER FROM EACH ADDRESS ASSIGNED WHO HAD CONTACT WITH THE MOTHER ALSO 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT TIME BUT SHE MADE SHE KEPT CONTACT WITH THE MOTHER 
DID THE MOTHER FOLLOW THROUGH AND APPEAR AT SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT 
YOUR HONOR I'M GOING TO OBJECT UNLESS SHE ASKED HIM IF HE HAS SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THAT INFORMATION 
YOUR HONOR HE IS THE RECORD KEEPER 
DOES THE RECORD REFLECT THAT MRS. KINGSLEY FAILED TO KEEP HER SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT 
WITH WHOM 
WITH ANYONE THAT SHE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS FOR SERVICES FOR IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE 
YOUR HONOR I BELIEVE I HAVE AN OBJECTION AND I HAVE HAD 
WELL THAT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT QUESTION 
HE'S THE RECORD KEEPER I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE HE DIDN'T GET INVOLVED WITH THIS UNTIL LATELY 
BUT HE'S THE RECORD KEEPER 
SO FROM THE RECORDS THE QUESTION THAT ASKS FOR RESEARCH OF THE RECORDS TO DETERMINE 
IS THERE AN OBJECTION TO THAT 
YES SIR 
I STILL SAY THAT'S HEARSAY AND YOUR HONOR I'LL LIVE BY THE COURT'S RULING BUT MY POINT IS THAT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THESE FILES 
IN THIS TYPE OF CASE WE'RE IN AN ELABORATE DISPOSITION HEARING ACTUALLY 
THAT'S CORRECT 
AND THE HEARSAY IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN A DISPOSITION HEARING 
HEARSAY OF THIS SORT IS THAT TYPE OF EXCEPTION THAT IS AVAILABLE IN A DISPOSITION HEARING 
WELL YOUR HONOR IT'S NOT ONLY A DISPOSITION HEARING THIS IS A TERMINATION HEARING 
I SAID THOUGH IT'S LIKE AN ELABORATE DISPOSITION HEARING 
LIKE AN ELABORATE DISPOSITION HEARING BUT IT IS A TERMINATION HEARING 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR YOUR HONOR
