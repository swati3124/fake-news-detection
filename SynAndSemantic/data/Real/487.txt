JUDGE LANCE ITO IS ONCE AGAIN IN HIS COURTROOM ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THE ATTORNEYS ARE BACK IN THE COURTROOM 
O. J. SIMPSON IS NOT BACK EITHER BUT LET'S JUST RESUME OUR CONVERSATION WITH WHAT'S GOING ON 
WHAT THE DEFENSE AND PROSECUTION ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT IS A DEAL ONE TO HOLD THE D. N. A. HEARINGS 
THE DEFENSE WANTS TO FOREGO A SEPARATE KELLY FRYE HEARING AND HAVE THE D. N. A. EVIDENCE PRESENTED BEFORE THE JURY 
THE PROSECUTION ON THE OTHER HAND SAYS THAT THOSE ISSUES MAY SIMPLY CONFUSE THE JURORS AND THEY WANT TO HAVE A SEPARATE KELLY FRYE HEARING FIRST 
ALSO ON THE ISSUE OF THE JAIL HOUSE STATEMENT YOU RECALL THE JAIL HOUSE STATEMENT WHICH WAS OVERHEARD JUDGE LANCE ITO IS SPEAKING LET'S JUST LISTEN IN TO THE COURTROOM RIGHT NOW

HE WAS UNDER THE THAT THE TRANSCRIPTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT WERE DELIVERED TO US ON THURSDAY AT FOUR O'CLOCK WERE THE TRANSCRIPTS OF TAPES THAT WE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED 
WE WANT THE RECORD TO BE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY TAPES OF ANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT THE FIRST TIME WE BECAME AWARE OF THE INTERVIEWS WAS WHEN WE RECEIVED THESE TRANSCRIPTS AT FOUR O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY AND I BELIEVE MR. DARDEN CAN CONFIRM THAT
